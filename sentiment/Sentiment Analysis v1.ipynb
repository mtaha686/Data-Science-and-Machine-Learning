       "['      one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just   oz episode you  ll be hooked  they are right  as this is exactly what happened with me  br    br   the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word  br    br   it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  br    br   i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn  t dare  forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance   oz doesn  t mess around  the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn  t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who  ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who  ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience  watching oz  you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing    thats if you can get in touch with your darker side         a wonderful little production   br    br   the filming technique is very unassuming  very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting  and sometimes discomforting  sense of realism to the entire piece   br    br   the actors are extremely well chosen  michael sheen not only   has got all the polari   but he has all the voices down pat too  you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams   diary entries  not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece  a masterful production about one of the great master  s of comedy and his life   br    br   the realism really comes home with the little things  the fantasy of the guard which  rather than use the traditional   dream   techniques remains solid then disappears  it plays on our knowledge and our senses  particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets  particularly of their flat with halliwell  s murals decorating every surface  are terribly well done         i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend  sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy  the plot is simplistic  but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable  even the well bread suspected serial killer   while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point    risk addiction  i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love  br    br   this was the most i  d laughed at one of woody  s comedies in years  dare i say a decade    while i  ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson  in this she managed to tone down her   sexy   image and jumped right into a average  but spirited young woman  br    br   this may not be the crown jewel of his career  but it was wittier than   devil wears prada   and more interesting than   superman   a great comedy to go see with friends         basically there  s a family where a little boy  jake  thinks there  s a zombie in his closet   his parents are fighting all the time  br    br   this movie is slower than a soap opera    and suddenly  jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie  br    br   ok  first of all when you  re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama  as a drama the movie is watchable  parents are divorcing   arguing like in real life  and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film  i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie  and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots  br    br     out of    just for the well playing parents   descent dialogs  as for the shots with jake  just ignore them         petter mattei  s   love in the time of money   is a visually stunning film to watch  mr  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter   br    br   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler  s play about the same theme  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect  each one is connected in one way  or another to the next person  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact  stylishly  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat  br    br   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter  br    br   the acting is good under mr  mattei  s direction  steve buscemi  rosario dawson  carol kane  michael imperioli  adrian grenier  and the rest of the talented cast  make these characters come alive  br    br   we wish mr  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work         probably my all time favorite movie  a story of selflessness  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause  but it  s not preachy or boring  it just never gets old  despite my having seen it some    or more times in the last    years  paul lukas   performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight  the kids are  as grandma says  more like   dressed up midgets   than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch  and the mother  s slow awakening to what  s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling  if i had a dozen thumbs  they  d all be   up   for this movie         i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero  s every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe i  ve got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my rhymes would be    lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit if this is so then i must go so lets do it         this show was an amazing  fresh   innovative idea in the     s when it first aired  the first   or   years were brilliant  but things dropped off after that  by       the show was not really funny anymore  and it  s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today  br    br   it  s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen  the writing is painfully bad  the performances are almost as bad   if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts  this show probably wouldn  t still be on the air  i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed  how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity  i felt i must give   stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success  as it is now  the show is just awful  i can  t believe it  s still on the air         encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film  bad mistake  i  ve seen      films and this is truly one of the worst of them   it  s awful in almost every way  editing  pacing  storyline    acting    soundtrack  the film  s only song   a lame country tune   is played no less than four times   the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme  rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film   br    br   the only thing that prevents me giving this a   score is harvey keitel   while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort  one for keitel obsessives only         if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie  if you are young or old then you will love this movie  hell even my mom liked it  br    br   great camp            phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines  br    br   at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn  t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore  br    br   its a low budget film  thats never a problem in itself   there were some pretty interesting characters  but eventually i just lost interest  br    br   i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking  br    br   for something similar but better try   brother from another planet           i saw this movie when i was about    when it came out  i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air  the horror  the horror  br    br   as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons  i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero  a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end  i didn  t care much for the romantic angle as a    year old and the predictable plots  i love them now for the unintentional humor  br    br   but  about a year or so later  i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star  janet leigh  was bumped off early in the film  i sat up and took notice at that point  since screenwriters are making up the story  make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula  there are no rules          so im not a big fan of boll  s work but then again not many are  i enjoyed his movie postal  maybe im the only one   boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished   br    br   people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned  that this is not far cry    this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks   feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with  these players go by the names of til schweiger  udo kier and ralf moeller  br    br   three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz  so the tale goes like this  jack carver played by til schweiger  yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes    however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass   people have complained about how he  s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don  t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a      br    br   however  the storyline in this film is beyond demented  we see the evil mad scientist dr  krieger played by udo kier  making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called  performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of   spoiler   vancouver for some reason  thats right no palm trees here  instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods  we haven  t even gone far before i started to cry  mehehe  i cannot go on any more   if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience  meaning most of it will suck  br    br   there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes  until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh   the movie far cry reeks of scheisse  that  s poop for you simpletons  from a fa r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead   btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he  s on screen          the cast played shakespeare  br    br   shakespeare lost  br    br   i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses  but why ruin something so good  br    br   is it because   the scottish play   is my favorite shakespeare  i do not know  what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler  hence bowdlerization  tried to do something similar in the victorian era  br    br   in other words  you cannot improve perfection  br    br   i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text  and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie  as the saying goes  just does not cut it         this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous  one of the actors is george clooney and i m not a fan but this roll is not bad  another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack  the man of constant sorrow   i recommand this movie to everybody  greetings bart        kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes  only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i  ve ever seen  sort of like a high school film project  what was rosanna arquette thinking   and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town  pretty hard to get involved with this one  no lessons to be learned from it  no brilliant insights  just stilted and quite ridiculous  but lots of skin  if that intrigues you  videotaped nonsense    what was with the bisexual relationship  out of nowhere  after all the heterosexual encounters  and what was with that absurd dance  with everybody playing their stereotyped roles  give this one a pass  it  s like a million other miles of bad  wasted film  money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa              some films just simply should not be remade  this is one of them  in and of itself it is not a bad film  but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the      film of the same title  liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke  but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it  s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects  again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film  but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more          this movie made it into one of my top    most awful movies  horrible   br    br   there wasn  t a continuous minute where there wasn  t a fight with one monster or another  there was no chance for any character development  they were too busy running from one sword fight to another  i had no emotional attachment  except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them   br    br   scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies  lotr  star wars and matrix   br    br   examples br    br    the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda  obee one and vader   br    br    the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings   elijah wood is the victim in both films  and wait      it hypnotizes  stings  its victim and wraps them up     uh hello     br    br    and the whole machine vs  humans theme was the matrix  or terminator      br    br   there are more examples but why waste the time  and will someone tell me what was with the nazi  s     nazi  s      br    br   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion  the movie could not decide if it was a children  s movie or an adult movie and wasn  t much of either   br    br   just awful  a real disappointment to say the least  save your money          i remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in       my dad took me my brother   sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england  i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies  if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is    miles away  would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it          an awful film  it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe  they  ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition  my complaint is not that they  ve taken liberties with the facts  if the story were good  that would perfectly fine  but it  s simply bizarre    by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film  so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script  i suppose there weren  t enough naked people in the factual version  it  s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist  s life    we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they  d favored the rest of the film with same brevity          after the success of die hard and it  s sequels it  s no surprise really that in the     s  a glut of   die hard on a         movies cashed in on the wrong guy  wrong place  wrong time concept  that is what they did with cliffhanger  die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly   stop or my mom will shoot   stallone  s career  br    br   cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream  especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing  base jumping  aviation  facial expressions  acting skills  all in all it  s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk  stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse  however  if you an forget all the nonsense  it  s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills  and unintentionally  plenty of laughs  br    br   you  ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness  his tick every box band of baddies  and best of all  the permanently harassed and hapless   turncoat   agent  rex linn as travers  br    br   he may of been henry in   portrait of a serial killer   but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as hal  he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors   that man never hurt anybody   and whilst he surely can  t be  it really does look like ralph waite  s frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death  br    br   mention too must go to former   london  s burning   actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy  who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football  yes  you can  t help enjoy that bit  hal needed a good kicking  br    br   so forget your better judgement  who cares if   that could never happen    lower your acting expectations  turn up the volume and enjoy  and if you  re looking for qaulen  he  s the one wearing the helicopter          i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this   b movie   in it  s entirety  br    br   all i have to say is    save your time and money    this has got to be the worst b movie of all time  it shouldn  t even be called a b movie  more like an f movie  because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie  the story is not interesting at all  all of the actors are paper thin and not at all believable  it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it  s almost funny       almost  br    br   the movie is just packed full of crappy one liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit  br    br   this movie is supposed to be geared towards men  but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive  especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end  they try to appear sexy in those weird  horrible costumes and they fail miserably    br    br   even some of the most ridiculous b movies will still give you some laughs  but this is just too painful to watch           what an absolutely stunning movie  if you have     hrs to kill  watch it  you won  t regret it  it  s too much fun  rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn  t anything more other than him  i still liked it  the music by a r rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times  you really start liking it          first of all  let  s get a few things straight here  a  i am an anime fan  always has been as a matter of fact  i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool   b  i do like several b movies because they  re hilarious  c  i like the godzilla movies  a lot  br    br   moving on  when the movie first comes on  it seems like it  s going to be your usual b movie  down to the crappy fx  but all a sudden  boom  the anime comes on  this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill  br    br   the animation is very bad   cheap  even worse than what i remember from speed racer  for crissakes  in fact  it  s so cheap  one of the few scenes from the movie i   vividly   remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school      it  s the same kids over   over again  the fx are terrible  too  the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla  in addition  the transition to live action to animation is unorganized  the dialogue   voices especially the english dub that i viewed  was horrid   i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd  vhs player  the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes   comments like the robots   joel mike on mst k  you pick the season   honestly  this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie   survive it at the same time  br    br   heck  i  m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b movie night  because it  s stupid  pretty painful to watch   unintentionally hilarious at the same time  i  m giving this movie a       an improvement from the        i was originally going to give it  br    br    according to my grading scale       means pretty much both boring   bad  as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it  then it will become as fun as counting to             this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards  i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film  it s great to see j beals but she s only in the movie for a few minutes  m parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for  the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable  the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch  there is no real emotional depth to the story  a movie revolving about an actor who can t get work doesn t feel very original to me  nor does the development of the cop  it feels like one of many straight to video movies i saw back in the   s     and not even a good one in those standards  br    br           the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter  s complex life  though it fails in giving accurate facts  and details  br    br   cynthia gibb  portrays karen  was not a fine election  she is a good actress   but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter  i think that the role needed a stronger character  someone with a stronger personality  br    br   louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific  she does a great job as karen  s mother  br    br   it has great songs  which could have been included in a soundtrack album  unfortunately they weren  t  though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries           the cell   is an exotic masterpiece  a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer  but also into one of a very talented director  this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations  this is boldness at work  pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent  this is the best movie of the year to date  br    br   i  ve read numerous complaints about this film  anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting  to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point  this movie may be a landmark  a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow    the cell   has just opened the door to another world of imagination  so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don  t want any more  personally  i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem  and would love to see someone try to challenge him  br    br   we  ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer  and yes  i do agree that the   genre   is a bit overworked  the   s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick  some of them worked  but most failed  but   the cell   does not blaze down the same trail  we are given a new twist  we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied  br    br   i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another  instead  she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity    the cell   wants to let you   see   what it  s all about and not   how   it  s all about  and i guess that  s what some people don  t like  true  i do like explanations with my movies  but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in  br    br   i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality  maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another  nonetheless  the set design was simply astonishing  i wouldn  t be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography  best costumes  best director and the like  if it were up to me it  d at least get nominated for best picture  br    br   i  ve noticed that i  ve kind of been repeating myself  not because there  s nothing else to say  but because i can  t stress enough how fantastic i thought   the cell   was  if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time  i guess this film was just a little too much for some people  writing it off as   weird   or   crazy    i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind  so it was right down my alley  leaving the theater  i heard one audience member say   whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs    if so  i want what he was smoking  br    br         out of            this film tried to be too many things all at once  stinging political satire  hollywood blockbuster  sappy romantic comedy  family values promo    the list goes on and on  it failed miserably at all of them  but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end  br    br   although i appreciate the spirit behind war  inc   it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort  especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique  rather than simply the poor writing  direction  and production of this particular film  br    br   there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war  but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening  reminds me a bit of three kings  which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern          this movie was so frustrating  everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time  i at least thought i  d be able to stand it  but  i was wrong  first  the weird looping  it was like watching   america  s funniest home videos    the damn parents  i hated them so much  the stereo typical latino family  i need to speak with the person responsible for this  we need to have a talk  that little girl who was always hanging on someone  i just hated her and had to mention it  now  the final scene transcends  i must say  it  s so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own  what crappy dancing  horrible and beautiful at once            war movie   is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich  d dialogue  rehashed plot and over the top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat  once in a while  however  a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen  the civil war era   cold mountain    starring jude law  nicole kidman and ren  e zellweger is such a film  br    br   then again  calling cold mountain   a war movie is not entirely accurate  true enough  the film opens with a  quite literally  quick and dirty battle sequence that puts   glory   director edward zwick shame  however    cold mountain   is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times  the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman  played by jude law  who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain  north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind  ada monroe  played by nicole kidman  at first glance  this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier  s tribulations on the battlefield  indeed  the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived  br    br     cold mountain   soon takes a drastic turn  though  as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter  incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates  and begins a long odyssey homeward  meanwhile  back at the farm  ada  s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields  soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast  coming to ada  s rescue is the course  tough as nails ruby thewes  played by ren  e zellweger  who helps ada put the farm back together and  perhaps more importantly  cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada  br    br   within these two settings  a vivid  compelling and  at times  very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds  the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex  enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby  s deadbeat father  ray winstone as an unrepentant southern   lawman    and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother  all have been greatly affected and changed by   the war of northern aggression    mostly for the worse  the dark  pervading anti war message  accented by an effective  haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina  is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought  though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century  it  s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant  br    br   director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film  but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters  the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film  though the inherently distant  abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot  br    br   make no mistake    cold mountain   has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama  it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether          taut and organically gripping  edward dmytryk  s crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller  an unlikely   message   movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle  br    br   bivouacked in washington  dc  a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars  three of them end up at a stranger  s apartment where robert ryan  drunk and belligerent  beats their host  sam levene  to death because he happens to be jewish  police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum  who  s assigned to ryan  s outfit  suspicion falls on the second of the three  george cooper   who has vanished  ryan slays the third buddy  steve brodie  to insure his silence before young closes in  br    br   abetted by a superior script by john paxton  dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs  ryan  naturally  does his prototypical angry white male  and to the hilt   while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance  his role  however  is not central   young may never have been better  gloria grahame gives her first fully fledged rendition of the smart mouthed  vulnerable tramp  and  as a sad sack who  s leeched into her life  paul kelly haunts us in a small  peripheral role that he makes memorable  br    br   the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing  but it  s pretty much confined to young  s reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier  thus  incidentally  stretching chronology to the limit   at least there  s no attempt to render an explanation  however glib  of why ryan hates jews  and hillbillies and      br    br   curiously  crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it    the novel it  s based on  richard brooks   the brick foxhole  dealt with a gay bashing murder  but homosexuality in      was still beyond the pale  news of the holocaust had  however  begun to emerge from the ashes of europe  so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti semitism  the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer   br    br   but while the change from homophobia to anti semitism works in general  the specifics don  t fit so smoothly  the victim  s chatting up a lonesome  drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd  even though  or especially since  there  s a girlfriend in tow  it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip off to the original engine generating ryan  s murderous rage            ardh satya   is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema  directed by the great director govind nihalani  this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success  even today  ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india  br    br   the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the   s  unlike any police of other cities in india  mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether  govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment  br    br   amongst various police officers   colleagues  the film describes the story of anand velankar  a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family  his father is a harsh police constable  anand himself suffers from his father  s ideologies   incidences of his father  s atrocities on his mother  anand  s approach towards immediate action against crime  is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction  the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand  s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations  as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction  resulting from the frustrations  his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms   bars  also turning him to an alcoholic  br    br   the spirit within him is still alive  as he constantly fights the system  he is aware of the system of the metro  where the police   politicians are a inertly associated by far end  his compromise towards unethical practice is negative  finally he gets suspended  br    br   the direction is a master piece   thoroughly hard core  one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty  s house to arrest him  followed by short conversation which is fantastic  at many scenes  the film has hair raising moments  br    br   the practical approach of script is a major punch  alcoholism  corruption  political influence  courage  deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today  those aspects are dealt brilliantly  br    br   finally  the films belongs to the one man show  om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly          my first exposure to the templarios   not a good one  i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video  which has brought us other cult classics such as   spider baby    the print quality is excellent  but this alone can  t hide the fact that the film is deadly dull  there  s a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars    set the whole thing in motion   but everything else in the movie is slow  ponderous    ultimately  unfulfilling  adding insult to injury  the movie was dubbed  not subtitled  as promised on the video jacket          one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist  the mafia middle man titta di girolamo  a physically non descript  middle aged man originally from salerno in southern italy  when we  re introduced to him at the start of the film  he  s been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years  conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to  while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo  s cash tell him that        dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes  at the news  he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account  meanwhile he tells us  the spectators  that when you bluff  you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous  he says  you can  t bluff for a while and then halfway through  tell the truth  having eventually done this   bluffed only halfway through and told the truth  and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately  love   is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo  s troubles   br    br   this initially unsympathetic character  a scowling  taciturn  curt man on the verge of     a man who won  t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye  becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about  at one point in his non life  titta decides to feel concern about appearing   ridiculous    the first half of the film may be described as   slow   by some  it does indeed reveal di girolamo  s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined  deliberate pace  revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details  however  scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes  the existence of titta di girolamo   the man with no imagination  identity or life  the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would   is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music  one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out    br    br   never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell  amore or l  imbalsamatore  another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist  s insomnia  not unlike the machinist  and in a far more explicit way  the al pacino film insomnia   le conseguenze dell  amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that  s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious  it  s almost impossible to pin point its cause  if indeed there is one    br    br   the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia  played by olivia magnani  grand daughter of the legendary anna  and the memory of titta  s best friend  a man whom he hasn  t seen in    years  unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually  though tentatively at first  accepts to look through again  though it  s never explicitly spelt out  the spectator knows that to a man like titta  accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences  a film without a single scene of sex or violence  a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator  s expectations  le conseguenze dell  amore is a fine representative of that small  quiet  discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt  xa  during the second half of the   s  the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino like fare  more la vita    bella style films    neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell  amore  l  imbalsamatore and others  your loss  world          i watched this film not really expecting much  i got it in a pack of   films  all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect  and you know what i was right  they were all terrible  this movie has a few  and a few is stretching it  interesting points  the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch  the drummer is very like a drummer  i e damned annoying and  well thats about it actually  the problem is that its just so boring  in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension  a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious  i had my thumb on the fast forward button  ready to press for most of the movie  but gave it a go  and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking  coz they don  t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot  i thought he looked a bit like a meercat  all this and i haven  t even mentioned the killer  i  m not even gonna go into it  its just not worth explaining  anyway as far as i  m concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london  who was actually quite funny  it wasn  t because of their acting talent  i  ve certainly seen a lot worse  but i  ve also seen a lot better  best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry          i bought this film at blockbuster for        because it sounded interesting  a bit ranma esque  with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton   because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back  and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it  i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge  i was      wrong  br    br   having watched it  i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker  since there is hardly any foul language  little violence  and the closest thing to nudity  honestly  i don  t usually go around hoping for it   is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties  you see her panties a lot in this movie  because no matter what  she  s wearing a miniskirt of some sort   even the anti religious humor is tame  and lame  caricatured  insincere  derivative  unoriginal  and worst of all not funny in the slightest  it would be better just to listen to ray stevens     would jesus wear a rolex on his television show     this would barely qualify as pg     it is not rated   but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of    rent this  as if it was pornographic  any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream  but they insist that zack and reba is worse  br    br   it is  but not in that way  br    br   in a way  this worries me  the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning  if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides  not this one  but better ones like the virgin suicides   it  s teenagers  if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect  then i have little chance of turning a story i  ve been writing into a pg    movie  the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve   suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers  i think it  s number     so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it  br    br   just say no to this movie  though                the plot is about the death of little children  hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings  during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter  in the end the serial killer get caught  that  s it  but before you find out who dunnit  you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors  it is unbelievable how bad these actors are  including hopper  i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time  just don  t watch the movie  i  ve warned you          ever watched a movie that lost the plot  well  this didn  t even really have one to begin with  br    br   where to begin  the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms  that are strangely never actually heard in the house great double glazing   the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away    or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable  or even the beginning which suggests a spate of     killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house  or the bizarre ritual with the salt   pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction  br    br   add a lead actress who can  t act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty  but not in the way you hope  br    br   given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the     s  mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder  it offers nothing but curiosity value  and one classic   daft   murder  don  t worry its telegraphed at least ten minutes before   br    br   after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up  halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe  what do they do  slide down and run like the rest of us  no  of course not  they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon  br    br   it really is only a movie as they say           okay  so this series kind of takes the route of   here we go again    week in  week out david morse  s character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle   but what  s wrong with that   david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there  and certainly the coolest  and to have him in a series created by david koepp   a great writer   is heaven   br    br   due to the lack of love for this show by many  i can  t see it going to a season series   but you never know  the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me   let  s hope something good can make it past a first series            after sitting through this pile of dung  my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie  it was that listless and formulaic  but the u s  propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves  disappointingly  that it  s the work of humans  call me a conspiracy theorist  but quotes like    we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it   seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq  etc  the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like    i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip   with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene  the   reasoning   behind each plot turn and new   clue   is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow  and there  s also a bonus side plot of misogyny  with dr  whatever her name was being chided by all involved for   never shutting up    she  s clearly in the movie only for looks  but they felt the need to slap a   dr    title on her character to give her some gravity  at one point  cage  s character says    don  t you ever shut up    and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands  like she  s a child  truly grotesque  the only benefit to this movie was that it  s so astonishingly bad  you do get a few laughs out of it  the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it  creepy             it had all the clich  s of movies of this type and no substance  the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it  the production was good  however  the script and acting were b movie quality  the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors  the good actors didn  t hold their own nor did they lift up the others   br    br   this movie is not worthy of more words  but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines  james wood and cuba gooding  jr  play caricatures of themselves in other movies   br    br   if you are looking for mindless entertainment  i still wouldn  t recommend this movie          this movie is based on the book    a many splendored thing   by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites  a topic that comes from han  s personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china  that background  and the beautiful hong kong settings  gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time  br    br   other than that  the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself  the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful  oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china  william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world  the acting is top notch  and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined  br    br   the cinematography really brings out fifty  s hong kong  especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments  the ending is a real tear jerker  some may consider sentimental romances pass    but  for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories  this is a shining example          of all the films i have seen  this one  the rage  has got to be one of the worst yet  the direction  logic  continuity  changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain    how could anyone come up with something so crappy    gary busey is know for his   b   movies  but this is a sure   w   movie   w waste   br    br   take for example  about two dozen fbi   local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer  inside the jeep is ma and is   confused   as to why all the cops are about  within seconds a huge gun battle ensues  ma being killed straight off  the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them  the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet  ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough  truly a miracle  not since the six shooter held     bullets has there been such a miracle          i had heard good things about   states of grace   and came in with an open mind  i thought that   god  s army   was okay  and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker  the film began with some shaky acting  and i thought    well  maybe it will get better    unfortunately  it never did  the picture starts out by introducing two elders    mormon missionaries    and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them  instead  the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries  something that undeniably exists  but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays  and it becomes almost laughable  br    br   dutcher  s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience  by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries  dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience  the film in no way reflects reality  missions are nothing like what dutcher shows  having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact  and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity  br    br   the conclusion  which i  m assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all  was both unbelievable  c  mon  the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home    and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other   and cheesy  next time  dutcher  try making a movie that someone can identify with          this movie struck home for me  being     i remember the       s and my father working in a factory  i figured  if i worked hard too  if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream  the house  a few kids  a car all to call my own  i  ve noted however  without a degree in something  unlike my father that quit at ninth grade  and a keen sense of greed and laziness  you can  t get anywhere  br    br   i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs  it  s made for tv  and i just saw it an hour ago  ic an  t find it anywhere  i  d love to show this to my friends  my pseudo friends  family and other relatives  see what they think and remind them that once upon a time  americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished   i think the feeling is still there  but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas            as a disclaimer  i  ve seen the movie     times in the last    years  and i only just saw the musical this week  this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn  t in the musical  however  it tainted me when i watched the musical       br    br   i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role  along with kasey  i think her   let me dance for you scene   is one of the best parts of the movie  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical  the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical  as well as the cast which is at least    times bigger  easier to do in the movie of course   the decors  lighting  dancing  and singing are also much superior in the movie  which should be expected  and was indeed delivered   br    br   the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie  the new ones are quite good ones  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion  especially compared to a musical which has few decors  the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters  but their dancing is impeccable  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical        protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors  the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary  the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie  unless you are a goldie hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film         how this film could be classified as drama  i have no idea  if i were john voight and mary steenburgen  i would be trying to erase this from my cv  it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules  abraham and moses got melded into noah  lot  abraham  s nephew  lot  turns up thousands of years before he would have been born  canaanites wandered the earth   really  what were the scriptwriters thinking  was it just ignorance    i remember something about noah and animals  and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school    or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible  from christians  jews and muslims  to historians  archaeologists  geologists  psychologists  linguists    as a matter of fact  did anyone not get offended  anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one          preston sturgis   the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late     s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television  in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael  s the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz   orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis   screenplay here  as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site  kael overstated her case  br    br   there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane  the newsreel  representing ralston   the henry luce clone   thatcher  s memoirs  bernstein  jed leland  susan alexander kane  and raymond the butler  each has his or her different slant on kane  reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man  and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane  s story  this method also leads to frequent overlapping re tellings of the same incident  br    br   this is not the situation in the power and the glory  yes  like kane it is about a legendary business leader   here it is tom garner  spencer tracy   a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country  but there are only two narrators   they are garner  s right hand man henry  ralph morgan  and his wife  sarah padden   this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner  henry  when he narrates  is talking about his boss and friend  whom he respected and loved  his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public   she sees only the flaws in henry  br    br   typical example  although he worked his way up  tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years  unions are troublemakers  and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans  henry describes tom  s confrontation with the union in a major walk out  and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life  but henry  s wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike  apparently blowing up the union  s headquarters   killing many people   so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black  br    br   i  m not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane  s success  few films do   including all of orson welles   other films   but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one  s interest to the end  and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally  the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home  br    br   when they marry  tom wants to do well  in part  to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had  but in america great business success comes at a cost  tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire  he expands it and improves it constantly   but it takes him away from home too much  and he loses touch with sally  and he also notices eve  helen vinson   the younger woman who becomes his mistress  when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her  br    br   similarly tom too gets a full shock  which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry   eve marries tom  and presents him with a son   but it turns out to be eve  s son by tom  s son tom jr   philip trent   the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself  br    br   the film is not a total success   the action jumps at times unconvincingly  yet it does make the business seem real  note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line  and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans   sturgis came from a wealthy background  so he could bring in this type of detail  so on the whole it is a first rate film  no citizen kane perhaps  but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america          average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo which means it  s still quite bad by normal standards  but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance  br    br   the genre  s well known weaknesses are in full gear  banal dialogue  wooden acting  illogical plot points  and the finale goes on much too long  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say  limp affair  br    br   fulci  s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing  though  yellow clues wherever you look  br    br     out of    limping killers         return to the   th chamber is one of those classic kung fu movies which shaw produces back in the   s and   s  whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood  and the protagonist gordon liu  the counterpart to the western  s clint eastwood  digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest  this is   presented in shaw scope    just like the good old days  br    br   this film is a simple story of good versus evil  told in   acts  which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era  br    br   act one sets up the premise  workers in a dye mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot  having their wages cut by     by incoming manchu gangsters  they can  t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters  and their boss  at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk  one of the best comedy sequences   but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times  br    br   act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob  however  without real martial arts  he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple  to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly  after some slapstick moments  he finally gets accepted by the abbot  whom he impersonated   but is disappointed at the teaching methods   kinda like mr miyagi  s style in karate kid  but instead of painting fences  he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple  nothing can keep a good man down  and he unwittingly builds strength  endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way  br    br   act three is where the fight fest begins  with cheesy sound effects  each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment  but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here  with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners  and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles  you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow  with some pause in between moves  but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad nausem in hollywood flicks  they sure don  t make fight scenes like they used to  return to the   th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday  so  if you  re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane  what are you waiting for

jimmy in seeing that rose as well as fred were true to him that he  like at his trial  had a sudden change of heart  but the thought of going back to prison  with at least another ten years added on

shame that when a politician ruins the country  those who voted for him can  t be denied the right to ever vote again  they  ve clearly shown they have no sense of character  br    br   what really stands out in this movie is the ambiguity of a character as hopelessly doctrinaire as robespierre  a haunted empty man who simplistic reductive ideology can  t help him elucidate the boundaries between safety and totalitarianism  execution and murder  self defense and patriotism  his legalistic litmus tests aggravate the hopeless situation he  s helped create  sound like any belligerent

  love machine    it starts to show its faux hand about the    minute mark  with    minutes left to watch   and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in  it  s downhill from there  br    br   director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon  but to be fair to eriksen  his problems started early  as he explains in the extras  he began wanting to do a real doc  couldn  t get funding  and settled for a cheaper way of making his film  br    br   the premise    people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website    was perhaps more interesting in          when the film was made  eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff    a pushy   host    hand held cameras  zooms  grainy blacks and whites    all  i guess  to elicit a sense of authenticity  but it just doesn  t work  the film is confusing and forced  but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue          the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more  of course it  s not going to be an oscar nominated film  it  s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for    minutes  br    br   the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert  it  s just them fighting back throughout the whole film  which includes a lot of violence  which is basically the whole film  as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing  and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience  br    br   i  d give the hills have eyes ii   out of    for pure entertainment  and that only  although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on  as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake  the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment  something to pass time if you  re bored  and nothing else  br    br                i laughed all the way through this rotten movie  it  s so unbelievable  a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage  has a breakdown in front of a real estate office  what happens  the office manager comes outside and offers her a job    hilarious  next thing you know the two women are going at it  yep  they  re lesbians  nothing rings true in this   lifetime for women with nothing better to do   movie  clunky dialogue like   i don  t

lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue  he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period   mistaken identity and espionage  as the u s  settled into world war ii and the large scale   war effort   of civilians building planes  weaponry and other necessary militia  the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes  these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good  law abiding citizens  knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre  producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption  war time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity  the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker  during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc  who co authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock  s sensibilities  br    br   this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate    year old barry kane  robert cummings  who  while at work at a los angeles airplane factory  meets new employee frank frye  norman lloydd  and moments later is framed for committing sabotage  fleeing the authorities who don  t believe his far fetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city  these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful   freaks   and a popular billboard model patricia martin  priscilla lane  who  during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security  he falls madly in love with  of course in the land of hitchcock  patricia  kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry  falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix  br    br   in good form for this outing  hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies  average joes  and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals  pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving  it  s a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited  culminates in one of hitchcock  s more memorable finales  look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions  all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the war time   shooting ban   on public attractions   while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock  s most well known films  it  s a popular b movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual   terrific hitchcock villains  remember to look for hitchcock  s cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film  hitchcock  s original cameo idea that was shot  him fighting in sign language with his   deaf   wife  was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf          i just watched the dresser this evening  having only seen it once before  about a dozen years ago  br    br   it  s not a   big   movie  and doesn  t try to make a big splash  but my god  the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless  albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie  br    br   the dresser is the story of sir  an aging shakespearean actor  finney   and his dresser norman  courtenay   sort of a valet  putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii  these are two men  each dependent upon the other  sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole  wheedle  and bully him into getting onstage for his    th performance of lear  and norman lives his life vicariously through sir  without sir to need him  he is nothing  or thinks he is  anyway  br    br   this is a character driven film  the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters  and as such  it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life  finney  only    years old  is completely believable as a very old  very sick  petulant  bullying  but brilliant stage actor  he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they  re taking their bows  and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser  who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer  employer is really the wrong term to use  though  for although  technically their relationship is that of employer and employee  most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple  br    br   yes  there are others in the cast of this movie  but there is no question that the true stars are finney  courtenay  and the marvelous script by ronald harwood  that is not to say that there aren  t other fine performances  most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge  there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires  old regrets  and what might have been  br    br   although it doesn  t get talked about these days  it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards  best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay  best picture  best director  peter yates   and best adapted screenplay  br    br   i had remembered this as being a good movie  but i wasn  t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end  if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about  and be hugely entertained all the while  then i encourage you to see the dresser          what happened  what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast  but somewhere the movie loses it  actually  it never really got going  there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant  then find out that she is after all  but that was it  steve martin  who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie  was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie  other than to make it longer  i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters  kate and angie  and maybe try not for a pure comedy  which unfortunately it was not  but maybe a drama with comedic elements  i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot          i  ve just watched fingersmith  and i  m stunned to see the      average rating for the show  br    br   not only was the plot was difficult to follow  but it seems character development was randomly applied  br    br   the actors were adequate  but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns  their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional  once this happens  the story really falls flat and becomes tedious  br    br   and just in case anyone didn  t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way  this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film  br    br   the end scene is disappointing and phoned in  and anyone who sat back and went   ohhh  so they were carpet munchers all along     must have been out for the evening  br    br   two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy  none for the rest of it            so let  s begin     br    br   the movie itself is as original as cronenberg  s movies would usually appear    br    br   my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses  she is as lovely as usual  this cutie  br    br   i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers  still it  s quite interesting and entertaining to follow   br    br   the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array     br    br   recommend with confidence              besides being boring  the scenes were oppressive and dark  the movie tried to portray some kind of moral  but fell flat with its message  what were the redeeming qualities   on top of that  i don  t think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did          an unmarried woman named stella  bette midler  gets pregnant by a wealthy man  stephen collins   he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own  things go ok until the child named jenny  trini alvarado  becomes a teenager and things gradually  and predictably  become worse  br    br   i  ve seen both the silent version and sound version of   stella dallas    neither one affected me much  and i cry easily  but they were well made if dated  trying to remake this in      was just a stupid idea  i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of   beaches   to get this made  this  predictably  bombed  the story is laughable and dated by today  s standards  even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end  stephen collins and marsha mason  both good actors  don  t help in supporting roles  flimsy and dull  really  who thought this would work  see the      stanwyck version instead  i give this a            don  t torture a duckling is one of fulci  s earlier  and honestly  in terms of story line  better     films   and although not the typical   bloodbath   that fulci is known for   this is still a very unique and enjoyable film  br    br   the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring  some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations   either as suspects  or those   helping   the investigation  or in some cases both    include the towns police force  a small time reporter  a beautiful and rich ex drug addict  a young priest and his mother  an old man who practices witchcraft and his female prot  g    a mentally handicapped townsman  and a deaf mute little girl  all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns  until the actual killer is revealed    br    br   don  t torture a duckling is neither a   classical   giallo or a typical fulci gore film  although it does contain elements of both   it is more of an old fashioned murder mystery  with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence  although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci  s later works   this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end  recommended for giallo murder mystery fans  or anyone looking to check out some of fulci  s non splatter films   but don  t despair  don  t torture still has more than it  s fair share of violence and sleaze  some may be put off by the subject of the child killings  and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys  which is also kind of disconcerting   but if that type of material doesn  t bother you  then definitely give this one a look                 busty beauty stacie randall plays pvc clad  bad ass bitch alexandra  the faithful acolyte of faust  an evil entity trapped in hell  determined to free her master  the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success  but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon faust  the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor  which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive  troll like creatures called lite and dark  br    br   now alexandra must find a replacement gem  which isn  t going to be easy  the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex lover  police detective jonathan graves  peter liapis   who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil alexandra is capable of  meanwhile  wise cracking inter dimensional half pints lite and dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home  br    br   in the warped movie world of jim wynorski  all females are big breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker  ghoulies iv is no exception  every woman in this film  whether she be a police captain  a curator of antiquities  or a mental patient in an asylum  is hot  hot  hot and wears not a lot  and it  s this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable  br    br   but be warned  even though the presence of semi naked  quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier  there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal  the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful  the black humour  as the dvd blurb describes it  is about as funny as a knee to the knackers  with the comedic banter of lite and dark being particularly cringe worthy  and the special effects are bargain basement  consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier  br    br        solely for the high bimbo quotient          i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie  it didn  t have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing  salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd  the music was not bad it was quite nice  usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film  the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes  ali larter  her acting had a lot to be desired  however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore  all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie  thank you          i  m not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies  which it is not  even though marques houston did appear in   hp     he played a totally different character  he was  eight years older  in this film  okay   so reid and martin weren  t the most talented and couldn  t carry a film all by themselves  but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference  albeit minor  to the earlier movies  i  m sure everyone who wanted to see it was   hoodwinked    into thinking that they were seeing a sequel  not a totally different film with a familiar name  and i  m sorry   kym whitley is not funny  and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris  ketty lester  or dc curry in the earlier films  although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion   i have to give this a thumbs down   just naming the film   down to the last minute   would have been ok  furthermore  the hudlin brothers  who produced the first three movies  were not involved in the making of this film          this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen  the writer obviously bought the playbook   how to write a space disaster movie   and followed it play by play  in particular  the stereo typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space   putting on a brave show in the face of disaster   has been done time and time again  br    br   max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw     million at the project  but  judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects  the producers could only muster     thousand  to learn that the film was nominated for a   special visual effects   emmy has me absolutely gob smacked  br    br   i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects  br    br   and the plot holes are too numerous to mention  but i will pick one out as an example  now  i  m no nasa expert  but surely it  s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program  surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before  br    br   the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell  he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script  br    br   i give this film   out of     with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark          caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up  robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason  while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield  ty webb is funny  being the only character from the original  most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original  henry wilcoxon for example  except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt  being played by randy quaid  every line he says reminds me of the originals humor  especially the scene at his office  i don  t go in for law suits or motions  i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f   ing baseball bat  make a bonfire with the chippindale maybe roast that golden retriever  arff arff arff  then eat it  and then i  m comin   upstairs junior  and i  m grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs  and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a    do we have an understanding    offsetting his small role however  is dan acroyd  who is obviously no replacement for bill murray  his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny  its just stupid  overall caddyshack ii is a good movie  but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it          honestly   this short film sucks  the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience  the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven  t made up my mind if this helps or hinders it  if the film was a little grainy it might have added some   creepiness factor   to what was going on  i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter   but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others  are more shocking than in aftermath  all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull      this is an expensive  beautifully filmed turd  it  s not that shocking  it  s not that disgusting  if you insist on viewing it   rent it  i give it a   for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia  there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos      the filming is good and it does have some   gore    if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore     but other than that   absolutely nothing going for this over hyped mess  on the other hand   genesis   cerda  s   sequel   to aftermath  now available as a   double feature   released by unearthed films  is an absolute masterpiece of a short film  really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material  although i don  t care for aftermath at all  genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future            i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written  its not just about entertainment  there  s tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across  and yes  it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn  t watch sepet and or gubra for    times   br    br   i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right  its really ironic how the characters relate  like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra  and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future   br    br   and i absolutely love the voice overs  its crude yet awakeningly fresh  like  when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard  then there was suddenly mukhsin  s voice saying   bismillahhirrahmannirrahim      the scene when he climbed the tree   br    br   it captured malaysian  s attitude and in some mild way  sniggering at how pathetic it is  portrayed in the character  for example  even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill annoying voice  and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long  and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl  when ur own life isn  t sorted out   br    br   all i can say is  this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it   br    br   it kept me glued to the screen  i couldn  t even take my eyes off it  not even to make out in the cinema  ha ha          i am not a golf fan by any means  on may    about       pm the movie started with a scene in the late       s  old movies i like but not golf however  within the first scene a young boy  harry vardon  is awaken by the voices of men  he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something    so   then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on  the movie is excellent  we then see this young boy now a man  professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood  then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf  you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period  then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning  don  t want to give away too much   i was up until   a m  this is super please see the movie          upon viewing tobe hooper  s gem  crocodile  in       i developed a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre  i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness  if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts  with ed writing the scripts  and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer  all we  d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants  br    br   while tobe hooper  s crocky opus referenced his own movies  blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies  see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions homages  rip offs to jaws  temple of doom  indiana jones   last crusade  the convent  godzilla       and any james bond movie  also  try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock  br    br   i was disappointed the crock didn  t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism   or crocky appreciation  but the quasi captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach  perhaps  in the coming years  we  ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset  or hopefully  a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero g monkey midget crocodile bloodshed  br    br   all in all  the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me          it tries to be the epic adventure of the century  and with a cast like sh   kasugi  christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the perfect b adventure of all time  it  s actually is a pretty fun  swashbuckling adventure that  even with it  s flaws  captures your interest  it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it  even if it  s made in the   s  it doesn  t have a modern feel  it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had  big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i  m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had  this on the other hand  just has the real feeling  you just can  t hate it  i think it  s an okay adventure movie  and i really love the soundtrack  damn  i want the theme song          the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang  do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety  no they don  t because coburn has a mission of revenge  to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman  br    br   that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after  as he explains it to his daughter  barbara hershey  coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff  his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired  it  s not something he  s proud of  she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt  br    br   lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is  heston is his usual stalwart hero  but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn  he blows everyone else off the screen when he  s on   br    br   coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities can  t touch him  he knows that heston has to make it personal then  br    br   coburn  s gang includes  morgan paull  thalmus rasulala  john quade  larry wilcox  and jorge rivero  heston has chris mitchum along who is his son in law to be  br    br   the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western  andrew mclaglen directed it and i  m thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh  it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence  of which there is a lot   br    br   for a little peckinpaugh lite  the last hard men is your film          maybe it was the title  or the trailer  certainly not the interview on the dvd  which is with the director as he keeps saying   hi  kids   into the camera like a buffoon   but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal  bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator  turns out it  s way too sleazy for its own good  or bad  or whatever  there  s a problem  and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust  similar to this in many respects  in not having balance to the sex and violence  too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno  and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies  and with the killing scenes  there has to be at least a little tack  and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity  in creating the creature killer whatever  entrails of a virgin has neither  it  s safe to say it  s a pretty soulless movie  even if isn  t one of the very worst ever made  it  s there just for horn dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their   other   heads  br    br   in this case  we  re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls  nothing too salacious  and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by   a murderer   as he  s credited  first off  the director kazuo   gaira   komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on  we get spliced in  or phoned in  take your pick  clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere  it looks like it  s from another movie  then once settled into the house  there  s a   wrestling   scene that  s poorly choreographed and shot  yeah  we really need to see him   all   there   and then on to the rape and killings  first the rape  by the photographers  who promise the girls some jobs for their time  then the murderer  who like d  amato  s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial  and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one  br    br   now  the latter of those  taken by themselves  should be considered the highlights of the movie  this is like saying  however  that the cro  tons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad  an eye gouging scene  a spike thrown like an olympic event  that scene  actually  is kind of cool   and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl  whose inconsequential name i can  t remember  even  this  becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title  on top of this  the sex scenes  which become tedious through   gaira   and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway  are dubbed over by the actors  you  d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough  hence the need to let them   speak   for themselves   but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one  where it  s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror  watch as the last girl left alive  the virgin of the picture  tries to stop the murderer from getting to her  which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him   you just want it to be done with  for the   i hate women   mantra to ease up or be rid altogether          the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes  when sharif or  please god  palance try their hand at fiery oratory  they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug  the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean  and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass  what does that leave us with  one comical dentistry scene  a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train  and  just for kicks  a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro  s manic and unremitting cigar fellatio  never trust a medved  but even a busted clock is right twice a day  this is a historically awful movie          this film took me by surprise  i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler  all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a      rotten tomatoes users ranked it at     and the critics averaged an amazing      if anything  they underrated this little gem  br    br   filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents   for posterity   and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents  outspoken mother mina  and less than forthcoming dad  mike  i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker  mike   mina  s son doug  was going to take us  as a matter of fact  i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this  br    br   life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey  it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told  absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must see even if you aren  t a fan of the documentary genre  this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten       birch street   is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you  the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience  eventually  millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work  bravo                 stephen hawkings is a genius  he is the king of geniuses  watching this movie makes me feel dumb  but it  s a great movie  not highly entertaining  but very very intriguing  the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings  a man who makes einstein look average  and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe  time  the galaxy  and black holes  everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they  v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they  ll write it all down  well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours  here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig  s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen  watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes  awesome  you won  t be the same after you see it          the story is about a psychic woman  tory  who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past  the death of her childhood friend and abusive father   tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring  can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders   br    br   you really don  t need to find out because  oh my god  this was so so so so bad  i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of     s  then the rest of us will see an imdb score of   and actually think this movie is worth watching  but do not be fooled  the ending was predictable  the acting terrible  don  t even get me started about the southern accents  y  all   and the story was trite  just remember    you were warned          oh god  i must have seen this when i was only    or twelve   don  t ask how  i may have been young  but i wasn  t stupid  anyone could see that this is a bad movie  nasty  gross  unscary and very silly  i  ve seen more impressive effects at disneyland  i  ve seen better performances at a school play  and i  ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo  where they do nothing but sit in the water  ignoring the children tapping on the glass  br    br   the story is set in northern australia  a handful of ambitious young people  are trying out a new water sport  surfing in shark filled waters  it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water  after they learn what  they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman  who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family  br    br   i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years  the best of which is lake placid  and the worse of which is its sequel  blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think  with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind  br    br   the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there  resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year  movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature  but a good hour and a half of the viewer  s life  unless you really want to see it  avoid blood surf            fate   leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life  all based around the number     as the story unfolds in real life and fiction  sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end  br    br   the number    offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution  the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential  the screenplay was probably the worst part about it  it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie  it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea  he just didn  t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time  the second half of the film was running low on ideas  the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful  br    br   joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number    reminds me that he  s still capable of making a stinker  he has the movie drenched in style but he just can  t get a good focus  he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace  he switches from reality to what  s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying  the actual book in the film that  s titled   the number      is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears  when carrey is finally done with book  we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery  at this point  the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension  we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it  s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished  br    br   the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable  jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn  t even seem to be trying  he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden  his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character  virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts  logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston  overall  the number    was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills  rating              we brought this film as a joke for a friend  and could of been our worst joke to play  the film is barely watchable  and the acting is dire  the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance  the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on  it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable  br    br   just terrible        this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life   it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous   and i have never seen such bad acting in my life  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller   i don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie   i didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves  i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch  i was very disappointed   the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion         this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds  i wouldn  t call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end  if you don  t want to know much about the plot  don  t keep reading  br    br   gilbert  s character  ophelia  is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident  gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she  otherwise a good actress  cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent  brad johnson  also an excellent actor  is matt  who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce  he is gentle  convincing and compelling in this role  br    br   the two meet on the beach through her daughter  pip  and initially  ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid  all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love  br    br   the chemistry between the two leads is not great  even though the talent of these two people is not  in my opinion  a question  they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical  two people meet  tragedy  bigger tragedy  a secret is revealed  another tragedy  and then they get together  i wish there was more to it than that  but there it is in a nutshell  br    br   i wanted mindless entertainment  and i got it with this  in regard to the genre of romantic films  this one fails to be memorable    a secret affair   with janine turner is far superior  not a steele book   as are some of steele  s earlier books turned into film         oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies    i don t even remember how many i ve seen  maybe it sells    but not to me  not scary at all  the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these    also the pulling of the kid  i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies  cellphone scene is also nothing new    the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked    i mean it lacked all dramaticness    ok this is for kids       who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique    we ll let me tell you  there s a million of you  d this is one of them       i ve seen worse but you won t be missing anything by not seeing this         nicholas walker is paul  the local town reverand who  s married to martha  ally sheedy   but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair  veronica  dara tomanovich   however in so doing  he gets a bout of amnesia  hence the name of the film   sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of   misery   type of way  it  s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this  not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator  in a film billed as a   black comedy    one has to bring both elements into said movie  while this does bring the former in spades  it sadly contains none of the latter  furthermore you can  t emphasize with any of the characters and as thus  have absolutely no vested interest in them  technically not an all together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one  br    br   eye candy  dara tomanovich gets topless  sally kirkland also shows some skin  br    br   my grade  c   br    br   where i saw it  showtime showcase         hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world  it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again  take superheroes for example  for each x man and spiderman  there are daredevil  elektra  ghost rider and hulk  japanese horror remakes are even worst  it only took the ring  which was pitch perfect  mostly because of mr  gore verbinsky   to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors  e g  the ring    the eye  dark water  which was fine  but pointless   and the grudges  br    br   the first grudge wasn  t entirely bad  it was scary most of the way  which is what one could expect from it  plus  the plot had some brains mixing narratives  grudge   is exactly like the previous  this could be a good thing  but hey  what boy men in black ii  was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain  for the grudge    the critic goes the same way  br    br   tired scares  bad acting  except for amber tamblyn   and clich  s all over the place  three stories take place  on different places and time  there is aubrey  tamblyn  investigating what drove her sister karen  sarah michelle gellar  to death  allison  arielle kebbel  who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place  and finally  an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door  glad to say  and i mean it  that everything is tied up at the end  but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture  when everything else is simply tiresome and dull  br    br   the chills are all over there  a girl alone in the lockers  someone who shouldn  t enter a house  others that dig too deep  meanwhile  ghosts keep killing and killing and killing  which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic  hey  doesn  t that seem just like another bad japanese remake  something called pulse  yeah  day after day it  s getting easier to hold a grudge    against hollywood bullshits            down periscope   has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs  since then  we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now  br    br   it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con  it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters  i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered  br    br   the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession  even among the very young  i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile  alabama in       a group of cub scouts  my grandson among them  had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board  br    br   it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood    which is rare company  br    br   thanks to kelsey grammar  lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie  such great entertainment          if you came here  it  s because you  ve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it  br    br   i feel for you  i  really  do  and i profusely apologize as a canadian  because that  s what we do  that this film ever had to cross your eyes  if only for a moment  i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases  br    br   i  like everyone else  rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b movie ripoff of blade  i thought    sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie    i  ll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their   creation    thanks for removing the rec xx xx xx from the bottom right hand corner of the screen  i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie  br    br   and for the record  i  saw  the movie  but did not watch it  the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother  s trailer  i swear to god  br    br   you know what  i  m not writing anymore about this  it  s just too painful          deanna durbin  nan grey and barbara read are   three smart girls   in this universal film from       which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences  it also stars ray milland  mischa auer  charles winninger  john king  binnie barnes and alice brady  it  s a sweet story about three young women  now living in switzerland with their divorced mother  who hear their father  winninger  is marrying again  not having seen him in    years and knowing their mother still loves him  they board a ship to america  with the help of the housekeeper nanny  determined to stop the wedding  realizing that the intended  called   precious    barnes  is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother  brady   they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count  this is arranged by their father  s accountant  king   the man he chooses is a full time drunk  auer   but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count  milland   what a mess  br    br   this is a delightful film  not cloying or overly sugary at all  with some nice performances  particularly by auer  milland  barnes and brady  the young women are pretty and all do good work  the emphasis  of course  is on young durbin  who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer  in fact  her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult   she has no trouble with the high notes  as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice  she sings a delightful   il bacio   in a police station  br    br   one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father  played by charles winninger  not want his children around   until he sees them and gets to know them  barnes as the gold digger isn  t all that young  but the girls   mother looks way up there  so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger  more glamorous woman  in fact  he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters  br    br   universal gives durbin the big star buildup here   she has the final shot in the movie  ray milland at this point was still paying his dues  and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is  br    br   very entertaining and of course  this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna          if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to  with conversation  character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new  better and different  those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing  directing  and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england  other days  other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment  made in      with alfred molina  joan plowright  polly walker  josie lawrence  jim broadbent  miranda richardson  and michael kitchens in the major roles  under the brush stroke direction of mike newell  these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter  s eye  reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century  this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character  and the viewer  too  an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us          i watched this series out of curiosity wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology out do cecil b  demille  s classic epic of       starring charleton heston yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke  of course  i was let down  yes  they had all the biblical characters correct  but they didn  t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes  that held your interest throughout the first movie  if you going to have a mini series  you have to have some   rivoting   scenes  the   burning bush    parting the   red sea   drowning   pharohs armies      building sethi  s pyramids    could have been done with todays   technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as   lord of the rings   or the matrix  obviously  they didn  t want to leave a lasting impression of   faith and sacrifice    which is much needed in these trouble times          daniel day lewis is the most versatile actor alive  english aristocratic snob in a room with a view  passionate irish thief in in the name of the father  an impudent  violent butcher in gangs of new york  in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brody  s in the pianist  and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot  just to name a few   his roles all influence eachother  but each is seperate  and utterly unique  he changes completely  with each character he takes on  and i  m beginning to believe that he can act as anything  anything  br    br   as cristy brown he is stunning  he does not ridicule the character  and he does not pity the character  a difficult achievement  and cristy brown comes to life  a smart man  an outrageous man  human  br    br   this movie  despite small scene transition faults and the like  is an inspiration  yes  it  s predictable  but is it stupidly sentimental  no  i laughed  i cried  not a single moment of cheese  proof that this isn  t a hollywood movie  br    br   my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant  when cristy is discussing painters with eileen  peter and her friends  here  s where daniel day lewis reaches an acting climax    i  ll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that  s animated      wheel out the cripple    and his performance never slows down  never falters  and is beautiful  simply  he has a lot of screen time here  i watch it again again  and i never get tired of cristy  s perspicacious eyes  twitching and guttural speeches  br    br   a must see  fo sho  yo          my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts  and thus at least a quarter longer  because otherwise how can one explain its confused  abbreviated storyline  i was never completely lost  but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation  the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot  br    br   if it were longer  it might make more sense  but it still wouldn  t be much good  the movie  s most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female  but the movie drops the ball on this  making hera  s followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus   followers do or believe  the movie is also interesting because you don  t see the gods and there  s no real certainty that they exist  so it  s got a couple of intriguing ideas  but it doesn  t do anything useful with them  br    br   bad dialog  cardboard characters  and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons  not unwatchable but also not worth watching          well  i like to watch bad horror b movies  cause i think it  s interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie   i always compare this movies to   for example   some spielberg  s works and again and again don  t understand the huge difference in what i see   i like ed wood  s movies cause it  s so inept it  s very funny  but people      the chilling   is not funny and is not even   interesting    it  s extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable  there  s no acting  no screenplay  no direction  no thrills and not even blood  it  s extremely inept amateurish film  it  s definitely the worst movie i had ever seen  and i had seen a lot of   worst movies     believe me   i warned you                  this is the worst movie i have ever seen  as well as  the worst that i will probably ever see  i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously  just be forewarned    br    br   this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it  its just plain bad bad bad bad bad  br    br   this movie is the equivalent to having a   pet rock   as your friend  you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen  unfortunately  it never does  at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into  lion  s gate completely deceives on this bombshell    no   this is a disaster  after watching this film  you would swear george w  bush had his hands all over the making of this film    yes its that idiotic  br    br   stay away  unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time  its probably how lion  s gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe          i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember  i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid  this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new  super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise  there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it  while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario  the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space  br    br   the story begins much like any other mario game  mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom  upon arriving at peach  s castle mario finds bowser and his son  bowser jr   attacking the castle with their airships  bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space  in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet  mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma  s home  a floating space station  here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader  a woman named rosalina  rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station  s power stars and scattered them across the universe  it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach  thus the adventure begins  br    br   the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies  each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars  mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity  some planets are small and others are big  many planets are similar to classic mario environments  the best thing about the game are the controls  all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same  but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game  you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game  and it will as well activate the shooting stars  you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment  then there is the graphics  these are by far the best graphics on the wii  it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks  you could probably almost say it looks as good as some     games  br    br   my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to  and also the story is pretty weak  the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game  no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at   lives  still these minor problems aside it  s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging  this is the type of game that we  ve been waiting for on the wii  br    br   a perfect    out of              this short film that inspired the soon to be full length feature   spatula madness   is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers  the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job  joins in the fight against the evil spoons  this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning  but is barely present for the remainder of the feature  this film  s    minute running time is absorbed by some odd ball comedy and a small musical number  unfortunately not much else lies below it  the plot that is set up doesn  t really have time to show  but it  s surely follows it plot better than many high budget hollywood films  this film is worth watching at least a few times  take it for what it is  and don  t expect a deep story           okay  last night  august   th        i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr  van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival  here  s what i have to say about it  first of all  the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger  roman polanski  oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i  ve ever seen  second of all  in a short q   a session after the show mr  van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself  calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them  that the film was based on his  van bebble  s  take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news  and i  m assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative   so i had second dibs on questions  i asked if he was trying to present the outsider  mtv  sex drugs and rock   n roll version and not necessarily the true story  this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting   f    you  shut the f    up  this is the truth  all those other movies are bullsh      br    br   well anyway  i didn  t even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film    you  ve heard the laws side of the story   now hear the story as it is told by the manson family    excuse me  if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn  t want to have anything to do with  how in god  s name can he tell the story for them   this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard  the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock   n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small  dimly lit theatre  and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock   n roll mind of a man who couldn  t even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen  this film accomplishes little more than warping the public  s image of actual events  which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today  into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual  br    br   the film was definitely very impressive to look at  the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie  s work with the family off of his lie album  the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos  all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers  i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving  probably the best part of the experience   the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying  the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy  throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow  lethargic  and chubby representation that was actually presented  br    br   all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie  or maybe it was linda  declares at the end    you can write a bunch of bullsh   books or make a bunch of bullsh   movies   etc  etc    case in point  even the disclaimer   based on a true story   is a dead giveaway  signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world  all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap  or actually  maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead  br    br   all i can say is this  when the film ended i got a free beer so i  m glad i went  but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f    up for asking the director a question  peace           i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart  i am glad i did  it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game  i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie game remake  the bonus levels were very hard  the sniper one i think was too hard  it made me so frustrated i didn  t play the game for a week and a half  there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it   br    br   the only thing i might change was the upgrade system  i didn  t notice any difference from un upgraded equipment to the upgraded  such as buying an armor upgrade didn  t seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter  i really liked the q copter  i think the developers did a good job           no  this hilariously horrible     s made for tv horror clinker isn  t about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake  still  this exceptionally awful  yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute  unremitting silliness and atrociousness that  s quite tasty in a so execrable it  s downright awesome sort of way  richard crenna  looking haggard and possibly inebriated  and yvette mimieux  who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in   jackson county jail    sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint  dull  sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit  pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann  the psychic alien moppets from the disney   witch mountain   pictures  are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty  ugly canine entity in the den  boy  now doesn  t that sound really scary and disturbing  well  scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain  t  but it sure is funny  thanks to curtis    night tide    harrington  s hopelessly weak direction  cartoonish  not so  special effects  an almost painfully risible  n  ridiculous plot  and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story  besides the leads  both martine beswicke and r g  armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman   favorite scene  the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna  practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade  while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock  devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo           it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen  and who will die  it is about   women and a man who on a vacation  this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies  when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death  br    br   this movie  like the others of that era  contrives to bring this about  and the viewer knows this  there is no mystery or suspense  the people squabble  but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time  it is laughable  br    br   the five people happen upon two savage young characters  and go nuts  everyone is nuts  so that the director writer team can justify their nazi propaganda  br    br   for some reason  the guy is attracted to the blonde  who is really not much to look at  and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over  one must remember that in the seventies  movies were meant to appeal to women and not men  br    br   totally crap and totally depressing           marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy   show people   released by mgm in       davies plays a hick from savannah  georgia  who arrives in hollywood with her father  dell henderson   the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot   as is davies outrageous southern costume  davies lands a job in slapstick comedy  not what she wants  but it brings her success  she meets fellow slapstick star william haines  who is immediately smitten with her  well  davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio    high art studios    and lands a job in stuffy period pieces  a handsome but fake actor  andre telefair  shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star  davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life  but of course learns that is not who she really is  marion davies is wonderful throughout  as she   outrageously   runs the gamut of emotions required of a   serious   actress  william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self  and there are cameos by charles chaplin  john gilbert  and other famous stars of the day  including the director of the film  king vidor  this is a silent film with a few   sound effects   as sound pictures were just coming into their own  a treasure of a film           the performance of every actor and actress  in the film  are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be  and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again  however  i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors   and director  attenborough  s credits that puzzles me  aren  t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent  long lasting film for the audience  i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one  possibly one of the   knowledgeable   personnel  insider  of the film           while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring  star trek the final frontier is plain bad  in this terrible sequel  the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth  romulus and kronos  the klingon home world  have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier  there  he hopes to find god  using mysticism and bad writing  he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship  they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god like alien  this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin  at the core is a good idea that is never really developed  the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before  it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco  the action scenes don  t have the suspense of wrath of kahn  the philosophy is boring  and the humor is stale  now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner  when he takes the director  s chair  the ego gets bigger  most of the focus is on him  spock  and mccoy  but does not give the others enough to do  moreover  whereas shatner is usually guilty of over acting in previous movies and television spots  he is just plain bad in this one  now kirk is reckless  a practical jokers  and silly  one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song    row row row your boat   in a round by a campfire  in any case  this is the worst of the star trek franchise  i should have given it three out of ten instead of five           despite later claims  this early talkie melodrama has very little in common with   citizen kane    it  s a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat  told in flashback but hopping around time  the scriptwriter  preston sturges  shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog  and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of   kane   are evident  still  it  s very watchable  with a young spencer tracy  his old man makeup makes him look just like  well  an old spencer tracy  showing depth and authority  and colleen moore    a little past her prime  and not physically well matched    playing a multifaceted woman behind the man  there  s also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history  sending the final third into ecstatic soap opera reverberations  the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets  and there are some plot holes left open  how would she know whose son it was if she  s sleeping with both of them    and the music is awfully hokey  for all that  i was quite fascinated           this is the best version  so far  that you will see and the most true to the bronte work  dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared   not handsome    but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark  pretty as she is  is also a complete and believable jane eyre  this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it  nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true   romance   in literature  this is the way to see it  i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original  the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this           apparently  the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so called   movie    they described   blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence    i saw no   intrigue    i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie  i saw no   violence    at least  i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with   impervious   skin  but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the   plot    furthermore  as a viewer of many and sundry films  some of which include the occasional kung fu movie   i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable  whatever you may choose to do  i will always remain br    br    correct  br    br    jonathan tanner  br    br     br    br   p s  i was not blinded by the choreography           i liked boyle  s performance  but that  s about the only positive thing i can say  everything was overdone to the point of absurdity  most of the actors spoke like you would expect your   year old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded  stone hearted cop  or an ultra evil villain  the raspy voice overs seemed amateurish to me  i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music  and what  s with the whole     ish police torture stuff  it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story  cox added a lot of things  in fact  that he apparently thought would be really cool  but had nothing to do with the story  that  s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges   stories so good is his minimalism    they are tightly bound  with no superfluous details  this movie is just the opposite  i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung  or thereabouts  i wasted    renting this  but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake          it s terrific when a funny movie doesn t make smile you  what a pity   this film is very boring and so long  it s simply painfull  the story is staggering without goal and no fun  br    br   you feel better when it s finished          so well made  no cgi crap  has anyone else been on the   jumping crocs   tour of darwin  s adelaide river before  black water was way realistic  rogue was a bit cringeworthy  br    br   thought the blonde chick was excellent in it   haven  t really seen her before  and the other chick is a babe  she is always excellent   br    br   v  suspenseful   i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick   br    br   got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys  as well   br    br   loved it           the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character  rather than star turns  the need to stage special effects  obligatory romance  and endless car chases  however  there is a car chase in here  and a dandy it is  aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer   recruited   to eliminate him  it is rare that a second or third tier actor  such as quinn  is given an important starring role like this that carries a film  usually  such a role is given to an a list actor with box office draw  which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it  donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous  somewhat creepy at times  agent that recruits quinn  ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent  the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines  which converge in gradual fashion toward the end  and not all at once as we  re used to seeing  the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity  the locations are convincing and effective  the soundtrack is nothing special  but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days  without dumb and or meaningless plot developments  unconvincing star turns  loud  annoying  music video type soundtracks  a villain that hams it up  and repeatedly a cast  costumes  and plot that cater mostly to an audience under     this is an outstanding thriller  which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release         of   stars           this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen    the stark scenery   the isolation   the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion   a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication   the acting is completely natural   but for me as a  foodie   the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast  i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well   whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don  t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette  s menu and choice of wines are authentic   and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be  this is a    out of    film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it          set in the       the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi  this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton  gerard depardieu  at his finest  and robespierre  a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak   the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre  he is opposed to   the reign of terror   which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens  mainly by guillotine  who are thought to be opposed to the revolution  danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting  but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown  and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors  this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland  his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union  which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties  his previous film   man of iron          had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa  and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski  and that between danton and robespierre  danton walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent  the film is based on the polish play   the danton affair   written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the     s  and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical  but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris           usually i  m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties   early nineties film featuring now has beens   but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through  guys dressing up as girls has been done to death   but never so pathetically  corey haim  s performance was abysmal as usual  nicole eggert was not much better  this has no redeeming qualities  even if you are a number    fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash   stay away           i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almod  var  but this would have to be the most disappointing so far  this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films  and the story just never got me interested  many almod  var regulars appear in this film  so it  s not like there was a lack of on screen talent  but this film just seemed more serious than his other films  if there was a comedic edge to this movie  i certainly couldn  t find it  and it made for one surprisingly weak movie           i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood  s novel   the robber bride    and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version  a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder  and his buddy  an ex cop journalist  tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman  s crazy female friends  it  s fortunate that the movie script fixes ms  atwood  s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men  victims of scheming women    br    br   heh  okay  you got me  if these guys are mentioned in the book  and i  m pretty sure they  re entirely made up for the movie  i  ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy  apparently  the three main female characters of the novel aren  t enough to carry the movie  zenia  s manipulations aren  t interesting unless we see them happen to a man  and a man  s life is screwed up  roz  charis  and toni tell their stories    to a man  because it  s not important if a man doesn  t hear them  br    br   i liked the characters in the book  it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man  s story  i normally do not look for feminist angles on media  and i tried to enjoy the movie as is  if i hadn  t read the book  i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more  so if you like the cop and the ex cop  and you want to read more about them  you  re out of luck  read the novel  if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot  it  s the same plot  the movie excavated it  ironed it  and sprinkled it with male angst  it  s like zenia  s revenge on margaret atwood          this movie gets a    because there is a lot of gore in it who cares about the plot or the acting this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can t expect much from the acting or the plot everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn t matter to me the italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie this is one of the goriest italian movies you will ever see no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true          ingrid bergman  playing dentist walter matthau  s faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss  is absolutely wonderful in this film  she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth  ingrid  s monologue is a front  but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart   matthau is an odd choice for the leading man  he  s too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman  not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist   but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie  hawn  who won a supporting oscar  is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today  this bedroom farce isn  t terribly sophisticated  and faintly reminds one of   any wednesday   besides   but it  s a welcome relief from the noisy  teen oriented comedies they turn out today    cactus flower   is a lovely sigh      from                 a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend  learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body  the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing  unfortunately  the man discovers while he is sleeping  his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage    according to the dvd sleeve  s synopsis  br    br   the synopsis isn  t entirely correct  as it turns out  br    br   anyway  the movie opens with a dizzying   out of body   example of handsome director winston rekert  as paul sharpe   s newly discovered   astral body   experience  it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight  young andrew bednarski  as matthew sharpe   being a kid  draws pictures of   the blue man    as his murder spree begins  handsome detective john novak  as stewart kaufman  discovers the victims are connected to mr  rekert  mr  novak  s investigation leads to the supernatural  a prime example of which is karen black  as janus   with whom rekert fears he is falling in love  br    br   several in the cast perform well  but    the blue man   winds up tying itself up in a knot  aka   eternal evil    its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good           ah yes the     s   a time of reaganomics and sly   chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies   at the time i couldn t believe how movies like rambo   missing in action and uncommon valor   and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn     made money at the box office   they re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly   troma s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place   of course not   troma s war lacks any sort of sophistication   though it does make the point that there s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones   and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up   maybe it is            this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces    the fall of the house of usher      dance of death    poem    is actually quite creepy from beginning to end  it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  for example    the cat and the canary      the old dark house      night of terror   and so on   boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life size dolls that terrorize the guests  he dies early in the film  or does he     and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences  i won  t go into too much detail here  but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries  br    br   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room  br    br   dan basinger               i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie  jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a pix entertainment  and without exception  everything this company deals with is pure crap  first  and this is very important  never ever watch this movie sober  why would you  unlike many other entertaingly bad movies  this one i feel was made intentionally bad  i just can  t get over how fake the snowman is  which is why its always shown only briefly  the way it moves is the best  this movie is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the michael keaton piece of crap  becuz that was made too be a good movie  and that version is as bad as this             revolt of the zombies   proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn  t necessarily make lightning strike twice  br    br   the halperin brothers  responsible for the horror classic   white zombie    made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi  s eyes from that previous film  there was a court battle with the   white zombie   film  s rights owners  who didn  t want the halperins to be able to use the word   zombie   in this title  that word was the only thing that could help this film  because  as everyone knows  bad films can make much more money simply by having the word   zombie   appear in the title  knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting  it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle  the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead  but simply hypnotism victims  br    br   wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies  be ready to crack a few eggs  including your own  br    br   the lame plot  man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend  whom she loves  jealous  this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn  t worth spit  br    br   this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i  ve ever seen  you  d have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming  the acting isn  t even good  this movie makes the racially insensitive   king of the zombies    which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought  seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic  it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest   invisible invaders   seem like a serious drama  this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch  south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama   the credits list the ironically named company favorite films  i  m not sure whose favorite film this would be  but they  re obviously an idiot  br    br   not recommended for fans of  zombies  romance  or classic films           the complaints are valid  to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women  i am okay with these night time soaps  like grey  s anatomy  or ugly betty  or west wing  because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end  however  when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men  taye diggs  tim daly  and chris lowell  into sexual tension and romps  and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so called little hospital  it seems like general hospital   or a female counterpart to baywatch  that was what men wanted and they had it  so if this is what women want so be it  but the idea that this is a high brow show  or something men will watch  is unrealistic           this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year  i didn  t see any cameos in the movie  but it is still pretty good  it is similar to anchorman in the humor department  but i think this is a better put together movie  it actually has a point  if you are going to see a whole bunch of t a you will be disappointed  just a well put together movie     if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor  you will find this to be a really good movie  i definitely think that ebert and roeper  s review of this movie is right on  i mean  i don  t really like ebert on most movies  but this is the movie that i will agree about  the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there  there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie  yea  sure  you get laughed at when it is found out about  but it still suggests that you wait  steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet  it is still funny           i remember seeing this film in the mid     s thought it a well paced and well acted piece  i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed  although my office is newish it just    seconds away from   the bank    even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces  br    br   it  s look like the dvd is due a region   release soon  the region   copy i is very poor quality  let  s hope they  ve cleaned it up  br    br   only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with           two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography  it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes       close ups predominated it  close ups of walls  humans and of many other things  the warm colored lighting  which is also usually by the director  gave the movie a warm atmosphere  only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it  an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time  each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie  silence and slow movements characterize the movie  some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close ups  not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant  i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes  the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the     s  this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end  in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema           luckily for bill murray this is such a light weight project since he pretty much has to carry it  meatballs is the story of low rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another  then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two day olympiad competition  above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut  br    br   the film is sprinkled with medium sized laughs  chuckles  and more than a few guffaws along the way  the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director  three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he  s sleeping  morty  or   micky   as everyone calls him  wakes up along the side of a road  strung up in some trees several feet above the ground  and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake  there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another  but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness  br    br   the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace  of course it  s up to murray to teach the kid how to open up  and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad  the sentimentality of rudy  s situation seems tacked on to a great degree  notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him    you must be the short depressed kid we ordered    makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad libbing while the cameras were rolling  in other words  murray might as well have said to makepeace    you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn  t fit in    but before it  s all over  murray  s performance makes this plot device more than bearable  he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace  br    br   the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps  very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable  but   it just doesn  t matter    this is a pretty good film on many levels  don  t let the absurd     rating this film is currently getting scare you off  murray will keep you laughing throughout  just be warned      avoid the sequels     especially the one with corey feldman     of    stars  br    br   the hound             the danish bladerunner   is boldly stated on the box  are you kidding me   this film is a complete drag  when i  m thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen  i usually pause the vcr  so i won  t miss anything  not this time  i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge  just so i wouldn  t have to go back  why the hell is there not one sciencefiction scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work  it  s mindboggling  one of the premises of film  is that our hero  who  s a hacker   has a little computerassistant to help him  the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future   when he loses the assistant in the movie  he  s helpless and can  t get into any computers  he  s a hacker  it  s like saying  that you can  t drive your car  if you don  t have your lucky   driving cap   on  i won  t even go into the lightning effect when he recieves electroshock             this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off  i know these horrible things happen in the world  but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen  these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies  they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species  br    br   this should be banned and destroyed  i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market   br    br   this movie should be removed from the public  the person who made this movie needs psychological help           anyone who thinks kool moe dee  carol alt  and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i  d love to try sometime  where to begin  lousy soundtrack  hammy acting    action   in places  this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed up has been and never was  s love to star in  i actually felt embarrassed for the   stars   in this   film    the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman  who if he would have been in the movie  would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad  rather than just plain bad  br    br   there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed    do you think i  m an idiot      yes  carol  i do  your agent does  and please for the love of all that is decent and holy    go away and stop degrading yourself like this  this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in  br    br   i would tell you what the plot was  but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article  plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway  so i barely paid attention           this film could have been a decent re make  and gosh knows it tried  or ms  english tried   assembling talented actors together with a successful   experienced writer director should be a formula for a decent film  but ms  english  s experience   according to her imdb bio   is exclusively limited to television work  and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film  br    br   i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film  and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential  it looked and felt like it was made for television  to give some credit to ms  english  many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv  and maybe a laugh track would have helped   so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen  if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini series or a sit com  i think it could have worked  but this is cinema and sadly ms  english  s talents didn  t translate  i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors   the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled  meg ryan is her usual perky  cute self  except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face   but where did she have a chance to use her talent   she has made films where she doesn  t recreate her stereo typed role and done them well    but not here  annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions   such a great talent and yet such a poor performance  i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance  and it was sad to see  what worked in this film in the     s doesn  t translate to the     s  and no one helped ms  english get the changes   updates or subtleties right  if only she  as writer  director and producer  had reached out for some assistance  i think it could have been good  but it was not  br    br   it  s so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone  s time   money  this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate  a few movie execs are having a meeting   the caption reads    let  s remake a classic with worse everything             i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill  jackie kennedy  s sister and the cousin of these women  would encourage the maysles   to make   big edie   and   little edie   the subject of a film  they certainly could be considered the   skeletons   in the family closet  the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women  i  d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating   i e    are they nuts  or am i missing something      this movie is hard to come by  netflix does not have it  facets does  though           c  mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode  it  s just an old     s tv show   this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe  yeoman barrow  s  ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location  unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages  br    br   this use of an outdoor location  and babe  gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show  br    br   except a few notable exceptions i e   the city on the edge of forever       assignment earth   and   tomorrow is yesterday   the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth balled and put out of it  s boring misery  half a dozen good episodes from    is quite a poor batting average  br    br   this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually  contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on  he actually made a lot of rubbish  he doesn  t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example  br    br   just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view  they used wobbly plywood for the floor  cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels  you can clearly see the folds in the paper   every expense spared or what            i just watched this movie on it  s premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia  i liked  not loved    mork   mindy   as a kid  mostly for robin william  s zany energetic performance  this movie made me remember why  was the original show great  not really  but robin certainly was  which brings me to this movie  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised  expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show  which in a way it was   but  of course  the real focus was on robin  it was interesting to see robin  s journey from struggling street jester to national t v star  and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife  and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr  williams with integrity  sensitivity  and heart  not just a cute impression  although it was even dead on   on an unrelated note  i noticed that robin  s struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman  who was under appreciated by network t v  and held back creatively  but that  s the   taxi   behind the scenes biopic   br    br   all in all  this was a very enjoyable flick  in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan  the acting was solid by all  never melodramatic like i suspected  and the story moved along well  performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi  the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot    not a great masterpiece by any means  i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber   but definitely watchable  especially for those robin williams and   mork   mindy   fans out there  nanoo  nanoo           i caught this film on azn on cable  it sounded like it would be a good film  a japanese   green card    i can  t say i  ve ever disliked an asian film  quite the contrary  some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean  and i am a huge fan of john woo  s hong kong films  i an not adverse to a light hearted films  like tampopo or chung king express  two of my favourites   so i thought i would like this  well  i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious  badly acted film ever again  br    br   i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude  because no one in this film had a personality  and when any of the characters did try to act  as opposed to mumbling a line or two  their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake  i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before   the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki   i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy  because i didn  t laugh once  even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this   a refreshing breath of comedy    it was neither refreshing  nor a breath of comedy  and the ending was very predictable  the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things  br    br   avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting  i actually think that   spike of bensonhurst   is a better acted film than this   and i walked out half way through that film           before i begin  let me get something off my chest  i  m a huge fan of john eyres   first film project  shadowchaser  the film  a b grade cross of both the terminator   die hard  may not be the work of a cinematic genius  but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit    spawned two sequels   a spin off   br    br   judge and jury begins with joseph meeker  a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called   bloody shootout    which seems like a poor name for a killing spree    meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store   being led to the electric chair  there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love  who was killed during the shootout   expressing his revenge for the person who killed her    michael silvano  a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team  and ends up harassing his son  s coach   but once executed  meeker returns as a revenant  or as kelly perine calls   a hamburger without the fries     whose sole aim is to get his revenge  which basically means making silvano  s life a misery  br    br   let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film  it is a supernatural action film  with meeker chasing silvano  using his ability to change form  which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator  a french chef  with an accent as bad as his moustache   a drag queen  a clown   a stand up comedian   a shotgun which fires explosive rounds   an invulnerability to death  although that doesn  t stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle   to pay silvano back for killing meeker  s wife  br    br   director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations  instead focusing solely on action scenes  which the film has plenty of  but that is the film  s main flaw  since there  s nothing to connect the action scenes together  the acting is surprisingly good  with keith delivering the best performance  supported ably by kove  as well as paul koslo  who plays the washed up cop quite well  kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse           ye lou  s film purple butterfly pits a secret organization  purple butterfly  against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai  ding hui  zhang ziyi  and her ex lover hidehiko itami  toru nakamura  find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting  br    br   i agree with the reviewer from paris  the film substitutes a convoluted  semi historical conflict for a plot  without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes  the sudden time shifting doesn  t help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless  normally i don  t mind dark movies  but the absence of light  the bone jarringly shaky camera footage  and the generally bad film making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in  i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film   has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography    but i don  t think that helps the movie  the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the   th century  and i don  t believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film  the overly melodramatic moments don  t add to its watchability  br    br   the actors are all suitably melancholy  zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films  brooding and looking generally annoyed  however  at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator  br    br   all in all  a very disappointing film  especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he                after hearing about george orwell  s prophetic masterpiece for all of my life  i  m now     but never having read the book  i am totally confused as to what i  ve just seen  br    br   i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel  as i  m sure most are  but only through hearsay and quotes  without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery  and even with it i  m still no more educated about the story of      than i was before i watched it  br    br   on the plus side    br    br   the cinematography is amazing  hurt   burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate  the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making  br    br   now for the down sides  and there are plenty    br    br   there is a war going on   at least as far as the propaganda is concerned   but why   with who  nothing is explained  there are a couple of names bandied about  eurasia etc   but they mean nothing without explanation  br    br   who is winston  what does he do  where does he come from  where does he work  why is he changing news reports  why isn  t he on the front line  why doesn  t he eat the food in the canteen  what is that drink he  s drinking through the entire film  why is he so weak   ill  why isn  t he brainwashed like the rest of them  what  s the deal with his mother   sister  what happened to his father  a little back story would have been nice  no scrub that  essential for those like myself that haven  t read the book  without it  this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on  br    br   the soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on  i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it  s very annoying all the same  br    br   also  i know this has been mentioned before  but why all the nudity  it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage  br    br   i personally can  t abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days  we are not all brainwashed simpletons  but this is a few steps too far the other way  i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you  ve read the book because if this film really is the   literal translation   that i  ve seen many people say  i would find it very hard to understand why      is hailed as the classic it is  br    br   there  s no denying that it was light years ahead of it  s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date   maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be    but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline  br    br   i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i  m to make any sense out of this  br    br   all in all  very disappointed in something i  ve waited for years to watch           this cute animated short features two comic icons   betty boop and henry  br    br   henry is the bald  slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks  br    br   well here he does speak  br    br   he wants to get a puppy from betty boop  s pet store  and when he is left to mind the store   some hilarious hijinks ensue  br    br   betty sings a song about pets  henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey  but everything works out in the end           i just got back from this free screening  and this   osama witch project   is the hands down worst film i  ve seen this year  worse than even   catwoman     which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction  br    br   in   september tapes    a   film crew   of   documentary journalists   heads to afghanistan   despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip  the conditions and  oh yeah  the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife  s death on sept       to track down osama bin laden  br    br   they   made   eight tapes on their journey  which now   document   their travels and  of course  their attempts to kill the terrorist leader   the eight tapes  thankfully  all end at points significant in the narrative  which is convenient for a   documentary     br    br   the psychotic  idiotic protagonist   who is given to long  significant speeches that he probably learned watching   macgyver     cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps  i don  t know why he didn  t just wear a sign on his back that said   shoot me    br    br   the crew  s translator  supposedly their sensible voice of reason  does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom   br    br   you wish they  d brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons  br    br   around   tape      i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew           i remember seeing this film in the theater in      when i was   years old  you do the math   i absolutely loved it  i was tarzan for the   weeks after seeing it  climbing the furniture  jumping around making monkey sounds   it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys  but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert  keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this        was the last time i saw that film  until about a month ago  it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at      am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at      am  i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid   br    br   upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that  that andie macdowell  s voice was dubbed by someone else  ian holme was of course solid as usual  and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up  but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan  he was great  the depth he managed to capture in so few lines  his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark  were just amazing  br    br   as i stated earlier i am lambert fan  but i  m used to highlander  the hunted and fortress  in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again  br    br   so to make a short story way too long  i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good  but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until     am to see it           a family is traveling through the mid west  there  s widower ben  charles bateman   his girlfriend nicky  ahna capri  and ben  s little daughter k t   geri reischl   then hit a town named hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely  their car breaks down and they  re forced to stay  they soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil  br    br   the story is not that good  people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end  also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end  the acting is pretty poor too  bateman and capri are bland and everybody else is about the same  only old pros strother martin and l q  jones give good performances  still this movie does work  it forgoes blood and gore  there  s some but this is pg  and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere  the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works  martin especially chews the scenery in his role  i can  t explain exactly why i  sort of  like this movie but it did work on me  it  s a quiet kind of horror that isn  t made anymore  hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered  a             francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman  s flight from her husband  and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her  we learn little about this woman  s marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late  she  s also recently learned she  s pregnant  which has further complicated her heart  she doesn  t want to be a complacent wifey  despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone   she meets two men on her journey  a former college football hero who  after an accident during a game  has been left with permanent brain damage  and a sexy  strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life  the clear  clean landscapes  as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler  are astutely realized  as are the characters  shirley knight  james caan  and robert duvall each deliver strong  gripping performances  most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms  some scenes  such as knight  s first call home from a pay phone  or her first night alone with caan where they play   simon says    are almost too intimate to watch  coppola toys with reality  turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we  ve been made privy to  he allows scenes to play out  yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy  there are at least two or three very frisky moments   it  s a heady endeavor  so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later  some may shun coppola  s unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony  however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings      from              this movie was not very well directed  they almost totally disregarded the book i guess they were trying   save time  the only upside   me was that the actor who played finny was cute  some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book  major parts of the book were once again chopped out you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely  also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary  also i was surprised   not pleasantly  by a new character that was no where in the book one of my favorite characters  leper  was poorly interpreted and portrayed  he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book  over all disappointing          the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear  sadly  they stopped there  they should have continued to make the script disappear  then the silly set  and finally every visible element of this film  because  there  s nothing else there to show  br    br   gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film  i don  t really think they exist  i think they bought this script at   scripts r us    where you buy a standard blank   monster movie   script and just fill in the blanks  there  s a monster stalking us  let  s split up   they actually   let  s split up   in this movie   hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar  not dead yet  burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire  not dead yet  you know  the standard stuff  even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie  ir glasses  spraying with something like paint  were handled badly   br    br   what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie  they psychological issues for the subject  the deterioration of the mind due to the process  treating an invisible subject  and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than   seconds and would have been far more interesting  had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end  it would have been a much better movie  all in all  it stunk  br    br   i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie  but i don  t want to do any spoilers  suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don  t think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than             a young girl becomes a war time marine  s pen pal  and when he visits at war  s end expecting someone a bit more   available    comic complications ensue  all ultimately works out well  naturally  but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery  errol flynn  s dead on impression of humphrey bogart from   casablanca   is a highlight  as are various send ups of his own swashbuckling image  the   jumping   scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot   it is tucker  though  who   tucks   the movie under his arm  lowers his head and barrels over the goal line  he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in   f troop   and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance  eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued  and little patti brady charms as tucker  s actual pen pal friend  a fine  lightweight   coming home   comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining           this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful  ashmit plays the role of richard gere  emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses   br    br   even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful  though it couldn  t catch up with the original  it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers  where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show  emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer  in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors  though the film bombed at the box office  the actors got the undue recognition  in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film   br    br   all said  this is not a family film  so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family           robert altman  s downbeat  new fangled western from edmund naughton  s book   mccabe   was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following  aside from a completely convincing boom town scenario  the characters here don  t merit much interest  and the picture looks  intentionally  brackish and unappealing  bearded warren beatty plays a turn of the century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel  once the profits start coming in  beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action  altman creates a solemn  wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place  but the action in this sorry little town is limited  most of the story being made up of vignettes  and altman  s pacing is deliberately slow  there  s hardly a statement being made  just the opposite  in fact  and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds  it  s a self defeating picture  and yet  in an altman quirky way  it wears defeat proudly     from               what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me  on second viewing  a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation  br    br   spoiler of sorts follows  br    br   poor cedric  he apparently didn  t know what hit him  poor audience  we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch  these two guys just didn  t belong together from their first ambiguous encounter  as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other  the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu  an intellectual being  to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach  br    br   on a purely technical note  i loved the camera action in this film  subtitles were totally unnecessary  even though my french is   presque rien    i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more  this was a polished  very professionally made motion picture  though many scenes seem superfluous  i rate it nine out of ten           i don  t think i  ve ever gave something a      rating  but this one easily gets the denomination  i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes  it  s not just that the jokes are so bad  but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma  can  t set up or finish a punchline  and you  ve got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach  br    br   i have watched the show  never in its entirety  but many times still  it just creeps up on me after conan  i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever  br    br   actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest  it  s just that  an interview  i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that  s screaming    get me the hell away from this freak    i do recommend watching the show  not for a laugh  but to ponder  how he got on the air and what he  s still doing there  watch as much as you can  i think you will find its complete awkwardness   interesting           in the standard view  this is a purely awful movie  however  it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale  i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie  andy griffith  s ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime  i wouldn  t waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it  but if you happen to be laying on the couch at   in the morning and it comes on tv  check it out           from the film  s first shot   keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn  thus invoking all the clich  s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama   i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself  br    br   joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book  but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen  s subtle  nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling  delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms  but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights  thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason  in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain  not to mention that jane austen  and in particular p   p  is not about passion  sexual tension or love  it  s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society  which was completely ignored  so that the bennets   house was a rambunctious  chaotic place where everybody shouts at once  runs around  leaves their underwear on chairs  and pigs wander happily through the house  the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy  and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety  br    br   the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety  and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap  so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots   particularly in this film   to function was completely erased  subtlety in general was nowhere int his film  sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances  br    br   it was so obviously trying to be a  serious  film  the humour   which is pride   prejudice  both austen  s methodology and her appeal   was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama  and when it was allowed in  was handled so clumsily  pride   prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points  yes  but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour  they are embedded in it  you can  t lose jane austen  s technique  leaving only the bare bones of the story  and expect the themes to remain  not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography  br    br   elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman  an adult  mature and sensible and clear sighted  keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl  and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine  elizabeth  s wit  her combative verbal exchanges  her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody  s follies including her own  her strength and composure  and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with     what  a lot of giggling and staring into the distance  rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs  she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation   and not genuinely raging  either  no  these were petulant hissy fits  and where the great strength of austen  s elizabeth  at least in austen  s eyes  was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety  knightley  s elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention  furthermore  she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded  and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it  an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance  in which quest for blandness and weakness  she was ably matched by matthew macfayden  br    br   donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak  ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic  his special bond with lizzie  as the only two sensible people in a world of fools  was completely lost  not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools  and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact  mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly  but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs  and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all  the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen   delivered with remarkable clumsiness   and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy  br    br   just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache           i  ve always enjoyed films that depict life as it is  life sometimes has boring patches  no real plot  and not necessarily a happy ending    a river runs through it   is the perfect name for this film  and norman maclean  s novel   life ebbs and flows like a river  and it has it  s rough spots  but it is a wonderful trip  br    br   robert redford brings a lot to the film  his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly  as a director  he is restrained and calm  and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes  as for the acting  craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers  i don  t know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn  s performances  except that they truly feel real    a river runs through it   is a wonderful film  br    br       out of             the story is very trustworthy and powerful  the technical side of the movie is quite fine   even the directing of it  the main problem is with the castings  that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clich   with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression  beside the small role of the father  rafael  played impressively by asi dayan   all other actors were unfortunately not in their best  the role of the elder blind girl  played by taly sharon  was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role  therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile  there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie  but after all it  s a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future           this movie was not so much promoted here in greece even though it got good actors   great script and rather good photograph was not a so called   blockbuster   movie in my country  the movie itself is very powerful it  s about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after been released from a  yo prison time drugs  the end is rather sad     mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well    lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency      out of    because very few greek movies can make such an impression           mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i  ve ever seen  but what a film  i thought it was fabulous  excellent and impressive  it was funny  well done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change  and being able to pull it off  this was great  i  ll definitely watch it again           you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he  s trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink  that  s a great metaphor for this movie  i kept watching  even though it was really difficult  but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling  this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth  i should have spit it out when i had the chance  br    br   the premise is corny enough to be fun  for the first time in like a thousand years  gargoyles have returned to romania  and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead  it  s up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok  unfortunately  the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads  the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles  br    br   in the end  this movie feels like a poor man  s van helsing  if you check your brain at the door  this might get you through a dreary monday night  i gave it   out of    stars           i can  t believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life  i laughed a couple of times    probably because of how stupid it was   if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn  t  the plot was so horrible   it made no sense   and the acting was so bad that i couldn  t even tell if they were trying  that movie was terrible rating  f          this is one of a rarity of movies  where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka  to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man  mo ogrodnik  and

the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember  br    br   it  s the sort of film that is worth trying the once  i can see why it wasn  t released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv  i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film  it didn  t much details except something like    john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up  jared harris stars    i  d never heard of him  he played john  or aiden quinn who played paul  however they are certainly underestimated actors  br    br   the film had a slow start but as it developed  i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters  as a huge fan  i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like  the script was brilliant and harris got lennon  s accent  personality and mannerisms spot on  quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent  the make up artists made them look excellent  br    br   this paragraph may be counted as a  spoiler   br    br   as i mentioned before  it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film  i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians  as for lennon  s rude line in the italian restaurant  totally unnecessary  the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it  br    br   it is quite different from the other biographical films i  ve seen where it  s about how the beatles got together and became famous  and those never really did the characters that well  e g    backbeat    br    br   in conclusion  i would say  if you  re a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan  give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise  at only about    minutes long  it  s worth waiting for the film to develop  br    br   if anyone does know whether the meeting of      really did happen please send it to the   comments page   for this film  i  d be very interested           an american werewolf in london had some funny parts  but this one isn  t so good  the computer werewolves are just awful  the perspective is all off

was rather disappointed  after watching the movie  my view was changed  the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that kg and jaybles portray in the movie   br    br   much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies i have seen in the theaters lately  ex  saw iii  dull and dragging   casino royale  way to homo erotic  which in prior installments i have really enjoyed  br    br   if you enjoyed borat  you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth          this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner  along with other such nasty films as   the burning bed      enough    or   monster    this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she  s not such a bad person after all  give us a break  here  s my question to the filmmakers  if letourneau were a man  and vili were a    year old girl  would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person  answer  hell no  br    br   imagine switching the genders in this film  and then you  ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage  were the genders switched  there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal  instead  we  d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl  his lascivious behavior landing him in prison  and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome  the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex  br    br   let  s call a spade a spade  letourneau is a pedophile  plain and simple  no ifs  ands or buts  she  s a criminal who belongs in prison  and deserves our derision and contempt  but certainly not our pity or empathy           the premise of this movie was decent enough  but with sub par acting  it was just bland and dull  br    br   spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death  it was accidental  so although it was a murder it wasn  t like the guy set out to do it  also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree  there is no emotion in this film  the first    minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister  and hearing her message  it was dull and boring  br    br   with some polishing  and better acting it could have been pretty good           the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy  quaint streets and sunshine  i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere  but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere  br    br   othello works for big  fat mr  karva  his crime boss step dad  at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it  s never really defined  but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers  so trust me  he  s a prick  doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand jobs  one of his colleagues is runner  a black dude who is always dashing from a to b  until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running  runner dumps the lost boy in othello  s flat  where he promptly starts granting more wishes  keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled  karva has the boy kidnapped  but he isn  t sure of what would really bring him happiness  is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand job  either way  i don  t want to see the little boy grant him the second  br    br   it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes  the ending tries to be shocking but since there  s hardly any back story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience  br    br   writer tony grisoni  a favourite of terry gilliam  tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell  ironically  if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film  as it is  we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy  who  s origins are never revealed  that  s just plain irritating   br    br   aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score  this film has little to recommend           i can  t emphasize it enough  do  not  get this movie for the kids  br    br   for that matter  you  d best spare the adults from it as well  br    br   all right  perhaps i  m overexaggerating a little  this isn  t the worst kids   movie    no  let me rephrase that  this isn  t the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults for dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids  that would be   jack    which i  ve been meaning to review   gut like a fish   br    br   adults won  t learn anything surprising  well  if you must  fast forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon   we don  t usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way  well  duh  i could have told you that  so can four years of college at an art school  but i degress   br    br   i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie  most likely it will only upset them  we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old   there  s a better movie    kiki  s delivery service    that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head  and the adults will like it too  br    br   by the way  there is a moment in the movie made with amature mst k ers in mind  if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it           is nothing else on tv  are you really bored  well  then watch phat beach  however  don  t rent it and definitely do not buy it  that would be a big mistake  br    br   i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points  i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard  however  there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at  if you are looking for an extremely funny   hood   movie then watch friday  if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie  something that this movie tries at  kind of  watch something like hoop dreams or jason  s lyric  if you are lookin for some good black   booty   go watch a dominique simone porn flick  because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent  however  if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable  go ahead and watch it  you will be slightly amused  br    br        out of                the elegant documentary   br    br   don  t watch this movie     if you  re an egotistical know all student of physics  this much less than one percent  miniscule fraction  of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know  br    br   do watch this movie    if you  re one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than     of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity  quantum  string and m theory  br    br   what a brilliantly architected documentary  starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic   and dimensions beyond  i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics  this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you  re about to fail the grade  br    br   the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini series split over three shows  it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented  i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence  br    br   we are all  and everything around us  is vibrational energy with a natural tendency towards harmony  this movie may blow your mind   or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us  even with the hubble telescope  and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high school  m theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of   possibility    br    br   it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it  s very nature move  by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting  out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy  br    br   you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god  br    br   bravo brian greene  well done indeed  br    br   p s  if you  re interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the   possibilities   quantum mechanics blended with spirituality  of all things  can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch   what the bleep     down the rabbit hole    yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn  t seen one before  my eyes process light reflections just fine   i see things everyday that i  ve never seen before  and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don  t divide  but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don  t like and hang on to those that you do   there is a lot to like about this film  br    br   then watch   the secret         documentary about the law of attraction   search for imdb title   tt            this information just might change your life profoundly   forever  if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought  if you  ll listen    and some are   and that is truly incredible  there is a modern day jesus mohammad buddha  those  among others  that history suggests have communicated with the non physical  alive today and she lives in texas  i know some of you know what i  m talking about  br    br   i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now           in       with the success of the first season of batman  the animated series  warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show with producing a feature length movie  originally slated for direct to video  but bumped up to theatrical status  it would become known as batman  mask of the phantasm  ten years after phantasm  we have had an additional three feature films released from the boys at the wb  sub zero  return of the joker  and now  mystery of the batwoman joins the family  br    br   the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm  a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin  now  batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line  br    br   the animation is the sleeker  futuristic style that was utilized for batman  the animated series   fifth and sixth seasons  aka the new batman adventures     it  s quite nicely done  and just as sleek as return of the joker  s animation  there is also some use of cgi  but it  s minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub zero  the music was alright  different and exotic and similar to the justice league score  although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans   rodent shaped hearts  br    br   kevin conroy  as always  does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman  it  s also great to have the old batman  the animated series alumni back  that includes bob hastings  commissioner gordon   robert costanzo  detective bullock   tara strong  barbara gordon batgirl  her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond   and efrem zimbalist jr  alfred   br    br   villains were also great   especially given that rupert thorne  the old mob boss from the original series  appears for the first time since the fourth season  br    br   overall  while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago  motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films  and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan  you will love the five minute short chase me           i think this movie was supposed to be shocking  but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it  s been made    and simply is  it  s one and a half hour of torment  even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie  the five girls   br    br   sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way  which is basically fine  since it  s a horror movie  and i  usually  like horror movies  i  ve no problem with violence in these type of movies per se  however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever  it  s no spectacle other than that it  s simply grotesque  it  s so lame it even gets boring  and really quick too  br    br   the worst thing  if the above wasn  t bad enough for ya  about this movie is that they  ve tried to copy the blair whitch project  by filming with cheap hand held cameras  but  again  this too  serves no end whatsoever  in the   blair which    sure enough  there  s an explanation  namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch  in this film  there  s no other explanation than    hey ya  ll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch     the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about  the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can  t make out what they  re saying  also  no effort has been made to make anything any better  sound wise or other wise  br    br   than finally  there  s the soundtrack  which is just as bad as the rest  and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock    br    br   my advise  don  t watch this under any circumstances           why can  t a movie be rated a zero  or even a negative number  some movies such as   plan nine from outer space   are so bad they  re fun to watch  this is not one    the dungeon of horror   might be the worst movie i  ve ever seen  some of anyway  i had to fast forward through a lot of it    fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age  there may be worse movies i  ve seen  but thankfully  i can  t remember them  the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint  the special effects looked like a fifth grader  s c  diorama set in a shoebox  the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant  he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim  who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it  without the gun having been reloaded  this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits  i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated  though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn  t needed  this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as   the manipulator    the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual  one time  hollywood leading man mickey rooney  the only time i would recommend watching   the dungeon of harrow    or   the manipulator   for that matter  would be if someone were to pay you   i  m kind of cheap  i  d have to have    or    bucks for   dungeon   and at least ten for   manipulator    phil the never out of the can cinematographer          this movie took me by surprise  the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation  after that  we  re plunged into a semi cheesy production  betraying its low budget  the characters  typical american teens  are introduced slowly  with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this  by the time the shlitz hits the fan  we know each one of the characters  and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities  it  s a slow uphill set up  kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster  thankfully  once the action kicks in  it  s full blown old school horror  steve johnson  s make up effects are awesome  equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films  and the scares are jolting  kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever  with heart stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set ups  the tongue in cheek  sometimes cheesy  humor marks this film as pure   s horror  as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like   night of the living dead   or   hills have eyes    but for true horror fans  this one is worth checking out  play it as the first entry on a double bill with the      remake of   house on the haunted hill    the set up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking           though i  d heard that   cama de gato   was the worst brazilian movie of the decade  i watched it giving it a chance  after all  first time director producer writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature  shot in video  for just us        and    though it looks even cheaper    i can  t begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it  then as i watched it i realized why   but whatever chances you  re ready to give to   cama de gato    they shrink to zero within    minutes  it  s an unbelievably preposterous  verbose  ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex  drugs and violence  and they  re made to look like closeted gays too   made with no visible trace of talent  imagination  expertise or notion of structure  visually and aurally  it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube    only here it lasts ninety two  count  em  minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness  and it  s not even funny bad  br    br   we  ve all seen the story before  bored young guys want to have fun  go partying  take drugs and everything goes wrong    there  s gang rape  spanking  murder  the accidental death  falling down the staircase    of the mother of one of the boys  culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill  moral and literal garbage  get it  the film is heavily influenced by larry clark  especially   kids   and   bully     but clark  s films    though also moralist and sexploitative    are high class masterworks compared to this crap  br    br   i don  t think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience  s throat  stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion    you do get numb minded with so much babbling  yelling  inept direction  shaky camera and terrible acting going on  stockler doesn  t care a bit about technique  the quality of the images  framing  sound recording  soundtrack songs  dialog  sets  editing  etc is uniformly appalling   but he  s a narcissistic control freak  he anticipates the criticisms he  s bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie cutie comments  and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is  i could relate to that    br    br   despite his megalomaniac ambitions  stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure    he can  t even decide if he wants gritty realism  hand held video camera etc  or stylization  repetition of scenes  use of alternate takes  etc   damn  he can  t even decide where to put his camera  there  s use of subjective camera for the three leads   the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever  the plot exists simply to justify the director  s profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for  all you see is a filmmaker being hateful  preachy  condemning  moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent  or technique  to go with it  br    br   it  s very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess  certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil  with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo  s  blat can be highly effective under good direction  as in   carandiru      lavoura arcaica      proibido proibir     here  he  s told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under equipped   actors   in recent memory  he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes  so goddawful they look rather like web cam porn   br    br   the film opens and ends with real interviews with   typical       middle class youth    stockler wants us to take those interviews as   proof   of what he  s trying to preach in fiction  but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees  selecting a highlight of abject  racist  sexist  stupid statements  which only shows assholes exist everywhere   stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle class youths are all present or future fascists because they  re middle class and enjoy recreational drugs  is he saying all neo fascists are on drugs   or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior   i couldn  t tell    br    br   with its dogmatic self righteousness  headache inducing technique and mind bending boredom    cama de gato   is bad for a       reasons but  above all  it  s harmful in a very insidious manner  it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument    cama de gato   is best unwatched  unmentioned  buried and forgotten           an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time  this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon  i remember this very well from my childhood  it was funny and sad and very beautiful  well it starts out a bit dark  a dog who escaped the pound  and gets killed by an old friend  ends up in heaven  and comes back  but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals  some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons  like the dream sequence of charlie  but everything else was okay and the songs were fair  a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise  i just love that guy  ahehehe  and judith barsi of jaws the revenge  may god rest her soul  poor girl  she didn  t deserve to die  but she is in heaven now  all good people go to heaven  overall this is a very good animated movie  a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame  recommended for the whole family  and know this  if you have the original video of this  you  ll find after the movie  dom deluise has a very important and special message  gotta love that guy  ahehehe           this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general  it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message  but the message was a clich    hopeless mess to begin with  this movie falls on shameless environmental point  even making a self righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet  br    br   in sitting through this  i couldn  t help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line  the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes  her character gets frequent  cringe worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit  br    br   far from the brilliance of bruce almighty  evan almighty blows its whole record breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot  the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan  s ark  but by the end  we learn that the ark was completely meaningless  and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages  the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark  flood  and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god  yes  god was trying to influence politics           it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance  i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing  if you loved bulgakov  s book you would be  understandably  afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art film project than for actually bringing the story  s deeper meaning to the screen  there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita  as complex and far fetched as the story is  the movie leaves out nothing  it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov  s work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score  with not a note missed  why can  t we find such talent here in the u s    so now my favorite book and movie have the same title           this movie is very violent  yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters  it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life  the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career  when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption  black mail and murder  this is where the killings start  from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper  this movie also co stars richard roundtree  br    br   i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good  i would not recommend this film and the action is very  very bad           the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi  s fate as an assassin  fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga  br    br   that  s as poetical as i  ll get when talking about azumi    death or love  because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin  after watching azumi   i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before  br    br   not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience  in azumi   we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics  which is their number one priority  as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape  but i won  t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi  s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma  by the way  chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go  minus the cool weapon and sense of menace  br    br   this brings me to the final blow which is the action  simply disguised in the title as the   death   side of the epic  in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons  to no one  s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily  in azumi    the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi   was at least climaxed and worthwhile  some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter  i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched  br    br   the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution  br    br   as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation  i won  t lie and i  ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film  but i  ll step right up and say that after watching azumi    the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece  for what it  s worth  azumi    death or love could have gone straight to video  with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins  doing their best to restore the peace  with an unwavering courage to die trying           this has to be the worst piece of garbage i  ve seen in a while  br    br   heath ledger is a heartthrob  he looked deformed  i wish i  d known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent   of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him   br    br   orlando bloom is a heartthrob  with the scraggly beard and deer in the headlights look about him  i can  t say i agree  br    br   rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self  but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn  t wait to get off the set   br    br   i  m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers  this is a far cry from butch cassidy  which actually was an entertaining film  this was trite  cliche ridden and boring  we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better  it didn  t  br    br   the last       minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious  heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel  and women and children are dying because of their presence  that  s not funny  but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on  because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail  i kept waiting for them to say   i  ll bite yer leg off    we were howling with laughter  as were several other warped members of the audience  when we left  pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was  br    br   i may not have paid cash to see this disaster  sneak preview   but it certainly wasn  t free  it cost me   hours of my life that i will never get back           a very ordinary made for tv product    tyson   attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect  fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing  and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting  a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans           i  m sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn  t  you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy  slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department  br    br   i just sat there through most of the movie thinking   is this supposed to be funny   and   this is the guy from tenacious d right     the truth is this film has nothing to offer  at all  it  s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction  you  ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn  t  i was bored stupid about    minutes in but though it would surely pick up  it didn  t     minutes later i  d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful  br    br   it  s like  remember years ago when you  d see anything with your fave actor in it  even some of their really early pap from before they were famous  and you  d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop  yeah it  s like that  br    br   i  ve enjoyed some of jack black  s earlier movies like shallow hall and i  m really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man  if you do this to us again jack i  m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something  at the least give you a serious talking to  br    br   i know it  s a clich   but this is one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen and for so many reasons              i haven  t read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on  but who knows  maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health  it isn  t that this movie is necessarily bad for your health  but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie  you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i  ve read on one hand  but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire  i get the feeling that she writes really good novels  the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history  br    br   still  stuart townsend  s voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt  s vampire narrative ever did  and you can tell that queen of the damned  s limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline  while interview decided to go with lace and elegance  queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously  one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places  the costumes and rock   roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack  br    br   however  i  ll give credit where credit is due  the soundtrack is excellent  korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead  br    br   the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom   splice montage  but after the first ten minutes or so  the directing degenerates quickly  it  s as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn  t enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice  what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects  unfortunately  queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress  where are the yellow contacts  where  s the pale blue make up  scene after scene  i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem  s lot and fright night when low budget was done right  br    br   there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage  props to aaliyah  and may her soul forever rest in peace  she might have become a renowned actress  had her life not been taken from us so prematurely  for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing  did i mention that the soundtrack was good  let  s see  what else can i say  it wasn  t too long  the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it  there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot  but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there  the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything  br    br   jy br    br   jimboduck dot com          while i count myself as a fan of the babylon   television series  the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start  although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there  the pace of the gathering is slow  the makeup somewhat inadequate  and the plot confusing  worse  the characterization in the premiere episode is poor  although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems  i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series           leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his      movie and video guide  what film was he looking at  kid vengeance or god  s gun are bombs  this film is a delight  it is fantastic  it is literate  it is well mounted  it is beautiful photographed  making a brilliant use of colors  right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre  the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks     sunset strip  and the famous showdown in the good  the bad  and the ugly  edd byrnes  george hilton  and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work  it is too bad mr  maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved  one can only guess as to his reason  i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be  kudos belong to everyone involved in this project  this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire           i don  t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the     club  they are today  s equivalent to the ku klux klan of the   th century  their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand  their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans  as well as billions of humans the world over  who don  t happen to share their bigoted  cruel  monstrous  and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen  the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth  such as the idea of   life after death   or   god   or   sin   or   the devil   is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill  so lost are they in their fantasy  sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn  t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy  however  the     club is in a class by itself  they are truly a cult  while i believe in freedom of speech  they way they spread hatred  lies  disinformation  and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits  i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way  people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all  treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country  as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion  the     club though  is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of   cult   but due to the     club  s vast wealth  conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip  they are above the law in this country  for those of you who have seen the movie   the matrix   you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth  the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes  and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them  br    br   in less civil times  the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the     club out of town with torches and pitchforks  but in today  s world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them  we have no way to rid ourselves of the     club plague   br    br   the television ratings system and the   v   chip on tv  s should also have a rating called   r   for religion  so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape  such as presented by the     club every day all over our country  from themselves and their children           if you wish to see shakespeare  s masterpiece in its entirety  i suggest you find this bbc version  indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but jacoby  s performance as hamlet and patrick stewart  s as claudius are well worth the effort  br    br   it never ceases to amaze me how clear   hamlet   is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard  every film version of   hamlet   has tinkered with its structure  olivier concentrated on hamlet  s indecision  gibson on his passions  jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet  s character together with the aid of shakespeare  s full script  br    br   why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately  hamlet says   i am very proud  revengeful  ambitious      hamlet is extremely upset  not only for his father  s death  and suspected murder   or his mother  s marriage to his uncle  but also  and mostly  because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet  he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius  marriages between royal kin is not unknown  done for political reasons  but that her marriage solidified claudius   claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself  he is  therefore  impotent to do anything about it  and this is true even after he hears his father  s ghost cry vengeance  he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so  he must   out   the king  s secret and here is the tragedy  at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius   guilt in public  he has opportunity to kill him and does not  why  he wants it all  he wants revenge  the throne and the damnation of claudius   soul in hell  hamlet overreaches himself in classic tragic form  his own hubris is his undoing  he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz  guildenstern  ophelia  laertes  gertrude  claudius and hamlet himself           the golden door is the story of a sicilian family  s journey from the old world  italy  to the new world  america   salvatore  a middle aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life  persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily  take the arduous journey across the raging seas  and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk  in short  they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled  the imagery of the new world is optimistic  clever and highly imaginative  silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he  ll be in the new world  carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health  and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield  all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience  the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they  re aboard the ship to the new world  br    br   the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness  especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within  the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world  the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive  this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left  donkeys  goats and rabbits  in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world  i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world  it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit  the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world  this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another  depicting the separation between the old and new worlds  this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar  wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise  br    br   as later contrasted to how the new world visually looks  the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world  i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island  but is remained hidden  i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for    give me your poor  your tired  your hungry   seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world  once they arrived in the americas  they had to go through rather humiliating tests  i e  delousing  mathematics  puzzles  etc   in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world  these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people  in particular  salvatore  s mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world  feeling more violated than treated with respect  where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide  the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude  salvatore doesn  t change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him  this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him  their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted  br    br   the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society  cleanliness  marriage and intelligence are prerequisites  adhering to these rules is to prevent disease  immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating  perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct  though the rules seemed rigid  they were there to protect and help the people flourish           nifty little episode played mainly for laughs  but with clever dollop of suspense  somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken down bus on its way to nowhere  but which passenger is it   talk about your illegal immigrants    all star supporting cast  from wild eyed jack elam  hamming it up shamelessly   to sexy jean willes  if she  s the martian  then i say let  s open the borders    to cruel faced john hoyt  the most obvious suspect   along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips  and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver   makes for a very entertaining half hour even if the action is confined to a single set           i had before a feeling of mislike for all russian films  but  after seeing this film i haven  t  this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the ussr  he knows the art of film making  and can use it very well  if you find this movie  buy or copy it           i watched mask in the     s and it  s currently showing on fox kids in the uk  very late at night   i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears  i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was  it  s just plain awful  it is no where near in the same league as the transformers  he man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made  i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses    comes on straight after it  that  s if mask doesn  t put me to sleep first   one of the lesser     s cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids           phantasm     class  phantasm ii     awesome  phantasm iii     erm     terrible  br    br   even though i would love to stick up for this film  i quite simply can  t  the movie seems to have   sold out    first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start  something the others did not   also too many pointless characters  prime examples the kid  who is a crack shot  funny initially but soon you want him dead   the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls  erm not gonna work  or rather shouldn  t  and the blooming zombies  what the hell are they doing there  there no link to them in the other phatasms   also there is a severe lack of midgets running about  br    br   the only good bits are the cracking start and  of course  reggie b  br    br    possible spoiler coming up  br    br   to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main   in iv  br    br   overall very  very disappointing                  ludicrous  angelic   year old annakin turns into whiny brat    year old annakin  who somehow seems appealing to amidala    years his senior  now    year old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams  and so takes to slaughtering children  his friends  and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a  his precious wife might really die  and b  only he can prevent this  ludicrosity squared  br    br   i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention  the story is ridiculous  the characters are unbelievable  literally  not the perverted sense of   fantastic      wonderful    etc    br    br   obi wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series  but in the climax  he hacks off annakin  s legs  lets him burn in the lava  and leaves him to suffer  doesn  t anyone think that  s a little out of character  not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living  as it turns out  br    br   i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations  none of that here  the story could have been written by a    year old  br    br   oh yeah  the cgi is pretty cool           scotty  grant cramer  who would go on to star in the great b movie   killer klowns from outer space    agrees to help three middle aged guys learn how to   dialog   the ladies in this bad       s comedy  not bad as in       s lingo  which meant good  bad as in bad  with no likable characters  including  but not limited to  a kid who  s the freakiest looking guy since   friday the   th part       a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her  and the token fat slob  because after all what would an       s sex comedy be without a fat slob   well this one has two  this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of       s sex comedies  and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel  br    br   my grade d   br    br   eye candy  too numerous to count  you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point  think   bachlor party   but not as funny  and very disturbing  br    br   where i saw it  comcast moviepass          if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it  this film is actually quite entertaining  it  s got action  adventure and romance  and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles  as evident on this board  the picture doesn  t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling  to get beyond that  one need only put aside the history book  and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction  i know  i know  that  s hard to do when you consider custer  s last stand at the little big horn and it  s prominence in the history of post civil war america  so i guess there  s an unresolved quandary with the picture  no matter how you look at it  br    br   there  s a lot to take in here though for the picture  s two hour plus run time  custer  s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher  riding up as he does in full military regalia  the practical joke by sharp  arthur kennedy  putting him up in the major  s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble  br    br   ironically  a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy  as in custer  s first meeting with libby bacon  and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie  hattie mcdaniel   i hadn  t noticed it before in other films  but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties  mantan moreland  so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress  with that in mind  the owl scene was a hoot too  br    br   as for flynn  it  s interesting to note that a year earlier  he portrayed j e b  stuart opposite ronald reagan  s depiction of general custer in   santa fe trail    both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland  in that film  reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers  while in flynn  s portrayal here it  s more than evident  but it doesn  t come close to that of richard mulligan  s take on the military hero in       s   little big man    let  s just say that one was a bit over the top  br    br   the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture  that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story  most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn  in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one  s point of view  earlier  a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer  s character  when he stated     you take glory with you when it  s your time to go             the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction  the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal  s driving  but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie  br    br   it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot  so just plan to enjoy the action  and do not expect a coherent plot  turn any sense of logic you may have  it will reduce your chance of getting a headache  br    br   i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies           interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno  s replacing carson as host of the tonight show  film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o  brien and jay leno  br    br   the film does a good job of sparking viewers   interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders  particularly of the nbc executives  the portrayal of ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting  i thought  br    br   still  many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon  and some of the acting seemed perfunctory  nevertheless  an interesting story           any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter day peer in my opinion  respectfully  the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive  as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare  i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things  for those unacquainted with target priorities  an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here  the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing  rank and british gaumont studios back in the day  frankly i prefer its quieter  more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over produced hollywood movie ever could  this reminds me of powell and pressburger  s the   th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman  a favorite of mine  john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles  so this is clearly meant to be mr  portman  s film but the whole cast shines  as for the title sequence  am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production  s lovely pre cgi gainsborough girl           a brilliant horror film  utterly gruesome and very scary too  the thing is a remake from john carpenter  but please  do not let that put you off this film  it is simply brilliant  the start of the film has the alien  s spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film  s title in amazing shining white and blue stating   the thing    one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever  br    br   the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen  it must have been great in the cinema  i regret not seeing this on the big screen  br    br   kurt russell is excellent as macready  the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base  all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected  my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection  it is tense  scary and finally spectacular  i love it because its funny as well  br    br   special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself  if he didn  t get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have  this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter  s greatest film   its certainly a gruesome masterpiece  br    br   wait for a cold winter night  get some budweiser from the fridge  sit down and watch the thing  a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime  br    br   utterly brilliant  br    br   ten out of ten           i absolutely love this film  everything about it  it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen  the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece  very original and creative  i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some  i  m really glad i ran across this movie  if only there were more genius   like justin out there           no one can say i wasn  t warned as i have read the reviews  both user   external   but like most of us attracted to horror movies    curiosity got this cat   come on  we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room  but you know that  s horror aficionados are always dying to know what  s in there even if we know it  ll be bad   br    br   the bottom line is that this movie left me angry  not because it pretends to be real  who cares   gimmicks are allowed   or because the actors and dialogue are so lame  is this an unusual event in horror movies   or even because the movie is so bad  and i am being polite here   what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp  but also a half hearted lazy rip off at that  br    br   i don  t believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them  but they didn  t even try  the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror  or any  movie           a new way to enjoy goldsworthy  s work  rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion  watching goldsworthy build his pieces  one develops an appreciation for every stone  leaf  and thorn that he uses  goldsworthy describes how the flow of life  the rivers  and the tides inspires and affects his work  although  i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy  s pieces  no snowballs   i do feel it was a bit long  the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy  s work to life  and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch           if you liked william hickey in   prizzi  s honor    he resurrects his character  as don anthony in   mob boss    this is a very weak   godfather   satire with few laughs  stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he  s doing in this schlock fest  morgan fairchild  s performance is one of the better efforts in the movie  and that alone is not a good sign for sure  eddie deezen vacillates between   three stooges   slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation  fatally flawed    mob boss   is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases  hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom  and numerous other nonsense    merk          i have seen most  if not all of the laurel   hardy classic films  i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly  even after watching it over and over again  this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel   hardy  however fails miserably for various reasons  one of which is how out of place their cloths are  still early   th century  however are both portrayed in the     s setting  some of the former dialogue was brought back  however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series  this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever  the real laurel   hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation           i just started watching the show around july  i found it by mistake  i was channel surfing during a vacation  it is a great show  i just wish it wasn  t on so late at night  it  s on at       am  as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time  br    br   i read some comments  i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the     s and not believing that this stuff can happen  br    br   i grew up in the     s  i  m hispanic and i had a   white   boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school  i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color  br    br   i can  t wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it  this way i can see it from the beginning           this film is well cast  often silly and always funny  lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection  brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director  from the first   hare krishna   to the last   you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs    i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy          i have just given a    for thieves highway  i mention this for two reasons one to prove i  m not a git who only gives bad reviews but   because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night  br    br   we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can  t avoid them all  they  ll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we  re talking about here  has a great life  she  s healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this   happy hooker   type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don  t want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame   br    br   secondly    pretty woman   insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this   lady   that is without his plastic friend  yep don  t leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination    out of    of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it  s the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money  where  s the charm  where  s the charisma  don  t mention that attempt at the piano please  br    br   girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most  guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator  as they probably don  t either so it wont have registered  more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate   thieves highway   a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject  br    br   i  ll finish on a song  br    br   pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman  the kind i like to treat pretty woman  i don  t believe you you  re not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy br    br   pretty woman  wont you pardon me pretty woman  i couldn  t help but see pretty woman  and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me br    br   pretty woman  shop a while pretty woman  talk a while pretty woman  sell your smile to me pretty woman  yeah  yeah  yeah pretty woman  look my way pretty woman  say you  ll stay with me  and i  ll pay you  i  ll treat you right          this movie was terrible  the plot was terrible and unbelievable  i cannot recommend this movie  where did this movie come from  this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including  gary sinise  kathy bates  joey lauren adams  and jennifer tilly           i strongly dislike this show  i mean  like  basically everyone at that school is perfect  and rich  and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that  and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school  isn  t that just a little weird  anyways  jamie lynn spears cannot act  she always has the same facial expression  which really annoys me  she is basically emotionless  and all the guys seem to like her  br    br   and shouldn  t chase tell her he likes her  its not that hard  really  none of this show is real life  and she isn  t   a girl like me   because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school  do not have designer clothes  and do not live by the beach  br    br   fake fake fake           normally i don  t like series at all  they  re all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast  br    br   these series however  are well played  the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one  the story will still be catching your mind  br    br   the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital           holy sh t this was god awful  i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor oedipus rex  dear god  this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff  please save your money  this movie can offer you nothing  unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters  you know  h ll  bring your girlfriend and make things interesting  you will be the only ones there anyway  f ck this slide show   br    br   ye be warned  br    br   i recommend not watching this  br    br   hello  br    br   how are you  br    br   i  m pretty good  br    br   enjoying this day  br    br   i am  br    br   this comment was one hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie  this is sad           this movie is without a doubt a perfect         for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no   good plot   or anything like that  thats ridiculous  saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot  you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes  for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that  if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan  s movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time  porn is watched for the porn  jackie chan is watched for the action  i think you people are rating it bad because there  s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained  sure the middle of the movie was boring  very boring  but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that  this did change the way how american action movies were created  they have even stollen scenes from this movie  if you want a true man  a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan  s  hes pure in everyway  he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park  and even in todays movies  american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more  police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do  a masterpiece          i saw this at the london film festival last night  apparently the shorter version  james mcnally  s summary of the content of the film is very good  nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation  homogenisation  the effect of the mass media  the power of capital and the need for diversity  br    br   the film is shot on hand held dv which some might find offputting  but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment  br    br   despite the sprawling feel of the film  the editing is very sharp  not only giving us a parade of the world  s dogs  but also undercutting a number of interviewees   comments with somewhat contradictory visual images  and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves  to a degree this evoked michael moore  s recent work  although nossiter operates in a more subtle way   but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls     the sorrow and the pity    both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of   salt of the earth   french peasants as the stars  de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards  we do indeed all need a little disorder   bravo hubert  br    br   overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people  and organise our world           i can  t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of    it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring  certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long  long time  br    br   in a no budget way  it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck  br    br   this film should be avoided at all costs  it  s one of those   festival films   that only please the pseudo intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it   different    therefore good  br    br   bad film making is not   different    it  s just bad film making           this movie really woke me up  like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber  br    br   this guy john  ben chaplin  leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town  until the stunningly gorgeous  wild  girl to die for nadia  nicole kidman   ordered by email from russia  enters his life to become his beloved wife  by johns plan  however a glitch turns up   nadia does not speak a word of johns language  although calm and emotionless on the outside  john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service  he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process  br    br   what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure  giving the viewer a subliminal message   you would have probably acted likewise    br    br   kidman  cassel   kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing    almost   only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues  however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right  nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles  at least from the cultural background  br    br   the pace of the film is fast and captivating  and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear  you rather feel that you  re in the middle of the plot  and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out  br    br   my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy  to sum it up  it has an unusual plot  great acting  and ideas below the surface  like the idea of the   rude awakening   from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society  s machine  the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings    welcome to the machine      i bet that in the end  john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all  br    br   thank you  writers  for the great story  and everyone else for this great movie  please make a sequel  and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever  because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the         percent of the potential viewers  i am sure of it           ed wood rides again  the fact that this movie was made should give any young br    br   aspiring film maker hope  any screenplay you might have thought of using to br    br   line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad  do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids  watching this br    br   movie made me realize that boa vs  python was not that bad after all  it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film  it is understandable why this director has so many aliases  there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips  then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to br    br   make your toward your tv set  s cocoon of cheese that surrounds it           this sports a nice  deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk  the first third of this movie was nothing but talk  and more talk  most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other   br    br   the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it  s really a   chick flick   and little else  this probably plays on the lifetime network  br    br   there was a quick murder scene and then more talk  by halfway through  they had lost me   br    br   by the way  sally field looked about    years old in here           i think this movie has got it all  it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head  it has cool looking characters  is really funny you know  the kind that you  ll crack up on the ground and you  ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks  despite the bad acting  bad cgi  and bad story about cops going after a robot   its really cool  its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch  get together  eat pizza  laugh like crazy  and watch it two more times  br    br   there are so many funny parts  like when kurt was trying to get edison  s attention and gave him the finger  and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball  on that part  i kept saying   remember  remember   to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened  there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought  and kurt was talking about his   strange dream   and how he was   superman    i loved that part  although it has been a while since i saw it  so i don  t remember that part  everything the actors said were funny  like how kurt says    i worship you  like a god    to the robot  br    br   although there was some bad things  in all it was a great movie  man  i can  t stop laughing  i wish i had that movie              howard  kevin kline  teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city  he is finally getting married to emily  joan cusack   much to his parents delight  the town is abuzz  too  because one of its own  cameron  matt dillon  has been nominated for an acting oscar  everyone  including howard and emily  is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner  in his acceptance speech  cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man  in part  because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school  you guessed it  its howard  but  howard has never   come out    in fact  he believes he is straight  with the whole town  and members of the media  waiting and observing the happenings  will howard and emily go ahead and get married  or  is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony  this is a wonderful  funny  and humane film about a gay man and his situation  as the man who did not realize he was gay  kline is excellent and touching  the rest of the cast is equally fine  with cusack a stitch as the mixed up fianc   and dillon  bob newhart  debbie reynolds  tom selleck  and others on hand to delight the audience as well  the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful  then  too  the script  the direction  and the production are very  very nice  but  the insightful  humorous  and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film  s best asset  no doubt  for those who would be offended by a gay themed film  yes  just skip over this one  but  for everyone who wants to laugh heartily  and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time  this is definitely the best film out there           when the opening shot is u s  marines seriously disrespecting the u s  flag  a movie has a tough road ahead  but unfortunately it was downhill from there  there is a military adviser credited  who is also apparently a retired u s  marine  making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol  and law  went unnoticed  even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia  then buried  in very short order  without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body  or if there even was a body  the u s  government is still finding the missing from wwii  and it takes months to identify the remains  military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified  or after years of red tape  here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks  maybe this happens in denmark  but not in the u s  clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with  or respect for  the u s  military  br    br   beyond that  there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere  there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash  having a script that worked might have helped  but this one seems to have been made up on the spot  working from cliffs notes  there  s no way to know if the script was this awful originally  or if it was the auteur  or the middle management kids at the studio who bear responsibility  either way  this is an awful movie that should have never been made           we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age  with the likes of the four feathers        and zulu  simply because the imperial age was  for the most part  british  here  in the wind and the lion  we see a wonderful rendering of america  s own imperial age  br    br   america  s projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who  despite her gentility  is smitten by the rough  manly nobility of her captor  who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn   politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of   native   peoples or cultures can rest assured  that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage   what makes this story different are the terrific production values   faultless photography  composition and editing   the terrific casting   the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy   and vivid history  br    br   though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son  every member of the family can identify with one of the characters  whether it be sean connery  s noble brigand  candace bergen  s feisty heroine  john huston  s wily john hay or steve kanaly  s spiffy  radiant  ruthless can do lieutenant  roosevelt  s   big stick    there is a transcendent scene at the end  when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed  this is high adventure at its best           i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while   what with all it  s raving reviews  nominations and media attention  and i must say  the first quarter of the movie was good  it really portrayed the black music scene back then  however  as the movie wore on  me and my whole family were bored out of our wits  the singing just kept coming  one after the other  i mean seriously  just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent  br    br   furthermore  i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters  i just didn  t care what happened to them  even when eddie murphy  s character died of a drug overdose  i knew i should have been sad  but i just couldn  t feel any emotion for that character  the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot  but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in  br    br   finally  the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care  which goes along with the lack of character development  this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray  chicago  and rent  ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion   overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn  t really care about an overall story  yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances           one of starewicz  s longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange  the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold  but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters  with the help of a stuffed cat  the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death  the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz  s films  the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz  s old style of puppetry  live scenes of moving cars and people  s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh  the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz  s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat  new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil  s club scene  twigss and newspaper shreds come to life  skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks  characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses  a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene  overall  starewicz is able to update his style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work           nice character development in a pretty cool milieu  being a male  i  m probably not qualified to totally understand it  but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start  it isn  t as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher  what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters  each has their own   thing   that they contend with  once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs  they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion  what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn  t go for cheap comedy when it could have  it didn  t try to pound a lesson into us  the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light  i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly  but  within this world  it needed to happen  good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people           prussic gas  a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip  and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish  the inspectors at scotland yard  higgins ijoachim fuchsberger and his superior sir john siegfried sch  renberg certainly have their hands full with this case  it all seems to center around student ann portland uschi glas   who  when she turns     is to inherit a great deal of wealth  the girls who are targeted share a room with ann  but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy  s finest must figure out  the staff of the girls   dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise  talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip  two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation  it  s a clever scheme where a driver  greaves g  nter meisner meets the convicts   who hide in a barrel who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard  taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind  he gives them orders on who to kill and how  uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening  under suspicion are girls   dormitory headmistress  her author brother  a sweaty  incredibly nervous chemistry teacher  a snooping gardener  and the bannister  some are red herrings until they are disposed of  throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered  the ending features multiple twists   br    br   out of the krimi films i  ve seen  the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it  s colorful killer  a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects    sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory  i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind  s secret hideout with an alligator pit   which isn  t used   the fake bible water pistol  when opened  fires the gas into the face of startled victims  the greaves   royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat  and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming  many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling  buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins   abilities to get at the truth   perhaps poking fun at know it all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it   i felt he was used as comedy relief  particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims  often misunderstanding what are told to him  higgins  using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator  instead follows the clues facts  often avoiding sir john as much as possible  capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed  and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content  the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect  any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls   executions  i  d say this may be one of the best   if not the best examples of the krimi genre  for it keeps you guessing  always one more ace up it  s sleeve  the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye opening   and  you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off            i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival      only a few days ago  i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life  i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings  there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn  character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth  this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community  the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive  i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness          this movie is really bad  most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement  there s a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg  there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth  and the plot is a bunch of post apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all  the whole thing is just laughable          i think this is one hell of a movie           we can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there  s a message in it  without the message it would be one of many action fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special           i saw this movie in the theater  and was thoroughly impressed by it  then again  that was when claire danes was a good actress  not the foolish  arrogant  hollywood ized bitch she is today  anyway  this film really struck me as one of the more raw  realistic  beautiful friendship films  how far would you really go for your best friend  i was moved to tears at the end  and still tear up when i watch it now  i own it   i remember as soon as i left the theater  i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her  this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend  however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you  d do something like that for her              i  ve seen this film literally over     times   it  s absolutely jam packed with entertainment    powers boothe gives a stellar performance  as a fan of actors such as william shatner  impulse        and ron liebmann  up the academy       i never thought an actor could capture the   intensity   like shatner and liebmann in those roles  until i saw boothe as jim jones  as far as i  m concerned  powers boothe is jim jones   this film captures his best performance             the three main characters are all hopeless  and yet you only feel sorry for one of them  ernesto  hopelessly devoted to mercedes  this was part of the frustration  screaming at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no good harry  to no avail  br    br   then there  s the satisfaction  steve buscemi has a great part as a transvestite  and harvey keitel  s moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible  when you least expect it  quentin tarintino is doing half a monologue  and anthony quinn turns ernesto into a wealthy man  br    br   time and again great moments appear in the story  but in the end it  s hard to know what to feel about this movie  it doesn  t have a happy ending  or even a complete one  but it somehow feels right  br    br   this movie is strange  but then so am i  no wonder i liked it           reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one  she appears like a fresh scrubbed face   tween   slight and stringy  but undeniably reese  br    br   i have always liked her as an actor  and had no idea she started this young with her career  go figure  i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on  i say that because whenever i have watched her perform  the characters thus far  in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character  quite nicely in fact  br    br   anyway  my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland  somehow i assumed that was her first time up   at bat   not so  well done reese         this game ranks above all so far  i had the honor of playing mine on ps  so the graphics were really good  the voice acting was above standard  the difficulty level is just right  wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion  the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn t expecting  the only rating this game deserves is great          this movie is not worth anything  i mean  if you want to watch this kind of stuff  flip to hollywood movies  this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name  neal n nikki seriously sucked  never watch this movie  as for the actors  it appears the acting genes skipped a generation  tanisha couldn  t have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director  s spoiled son   all of that halla re was amazingly stupid  the songs are eh  and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it       bottom line  i hated the movie  do not let your kids watch it  and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it  buy the cd  if you must   as i said  the songs are eh   at least it is better then the movie           this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers  it  s certainly all been done before and since  but the violent men is something special  br    br   what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films  she  s married to the crippled edward g  robinson who  s the cattle baron here  but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent  no matter to barbara  whose needs are being met by her brother in law brian keith  that doesn  t sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck  s daughter  nor with lita milan who is keith  s mexican girl friend  br    br   the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film  but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here  he  s every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often  i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford  s mouth    i  m a peaceable man    would have been very applicable in the vioilent men  br    br   the fifties was the age of the adult western  themes were entering into horse operas that hadn  t been explored before  the following year glenn ford would do another western  jubal  one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component  br    br   there  s enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well           apparently  the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood  i use the word   apparently   because without listening to a director andy copp  s commentary  which i didn  t have available to me  or reading up on the film prior to watching  viewers won  t have a clue what it is about  br    br   gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage  but unless they  re also fond of pretentious  headache inducing  experimental art house cinema  they  ll find this one a real chore to sit through  br    br      minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis chordant sound  terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue  this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one  s sanity  if you  ve still got all your marbles  you  ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead  i watched the whole thing  but am well aware that i  m completely barking             this movie was absolutely pathetic  a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes  at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead  i couldn  t even sit through the whole movie  emran hashmi disappoints  and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all  celina jaitley was not bad  the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris  it was pretty hilarious  the songs   sini ne   and its remix version were really good  you can always count on emran lip locking and lip synching a chartbuster  all in all  it seems emran doesn  t have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time           i feel the niiiiiight heat  i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart beat  something ain  t right    theme song written by b j  cook from skylark  david foster  s old band and wife  she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc  s   airwaves    oh night heat  what a program  well written  well acted and totally classic  crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end  i  d like to think this is really what detectives do did  giambone was a real favourite  on a canadian tip  i learned every canadian actor  s name and style from guest spots done on night heat  everyone passed through the night heat set and like law   order  it was story driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama           this movie fails miserably on every level  i have an idea  let  s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east  maybe if we  re lucky they  ll all be shot and killed and we won  t have to ever have our time wasted by them again  did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life  my god  i can  t think of anything i  ve ever seen that was this bad  i  d rather watch ishtar    times in a row than sit through    minutes of this sorry excuse for a film  if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film  i  ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless  that  s my two cents           yes i  ll say before i start commenting  this movie is incredibly underrated  br    br   sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass  he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star  glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind  br    br   the acting was good  apart from thewlis  br    br   stone really has a talent with this role  she  s slick  naughty and seductive and doesn  t look a day older than she did in the first she really impressed me like in casino   morrisey was also good  he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it  thewlis however was lame  he ruined his character and was over the top the whole way  he really sucked  br    br   overall  this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch  just ignore thewlis           based on a edgar rice burroughs novel  at the earth  s core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest  a victorian scientist dr  abner perry peter cushing invents a giant burrowing machine  which he and his american partner doug mcclure use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold  they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters  br    br   cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying  instead of being a bold adventurer  he comes across effeminate  on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable  caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth  also in the cast are  godfrey james  cy grant and michael crane           i have seen this film at least     times and i am still excited by it  the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat  plus i still think bryan brown is the tops  brilliant film           this show makes absolutely no sense  every week  two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening  and every week without fail  they somehow stumble upon a murder  because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder  right  but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder  wouldn  t the smart thing to do be to tell the police  you know  the people who can actually do something about it    but every week  these two fools go around  polluting evidence  committing crimes of their own  and  in some cases  causing more murders  once they do miraculously solve the murders  there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted  all the evidence has been sabotaged  and you  d think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two  wouldn  t you  yay  we  ve solved the murder  now like every other week  let  s go and confront the murderer ourselves and  with no back up  tell them that we know about it  there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger  is there  rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television  and certainly the most ridiculous           this movie was so bad it was funny  for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie  a la   for your consideration     the   cliffhanger   scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt  the script was dreadful enough  but coupled with sean young  s terrible acting    especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail  complete with flashbacks  while dangling off a cliff    makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching  in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie  i still can  t believe how this thing got made  first of all  how did such a bad script get the green light  how did star actors get attached  were they at low points in their careers  questions  questions           meryl streep is such a genius  well  at least as an actress  i know she  s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents  but she nails the accent every time  her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring  mrs  chamberlain  as portrayed here  was not particularly likable  nor all that smart  but that just makes streep  s work all the more remarkable  i think she is worth all    or so of her oscar nominations  about the film  well  there were a couple of interesting things  i don  t know much about australia  but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story  i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago  but it came through loud and clear yesterday  and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues  a pretty good film  a bit different  grade  b            airport     is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist   the concorde supersonic airliner   into their   disaster in the sky   formula  br    br   bogged down with unintentional humor  the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde  s window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat seeking missile following the aircraft  s flight path  and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air  many stars in this one including robert wagner  sylvia kristel  alain delon  and martha raye as a nervous passenger   br    br   not really related to the other   airport   films           supposedly a   social commentary   on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the       s    nightmare   is full of bad southern stereotypes  complete with phoney accents  not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners  this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly disguised   babe in prison   movie  especially in its uncut original version  nevertheless  acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors  in particular  does a good job of making viewers hate him  even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes  there  s also a change of pace role for the late robert reed  who appears as the lecherous warden  and tina louise  previously ginger of   gilligan  s island    made a rather believable sadistic prison guard  my grade  d   br    br             ok  i bought this film from woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday  because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it  br    br   but we decided it to watch it anyway  just for hilarity purposes  br    br   and i  m sorry  but this has got to be  one of the worst films in history  br    br   it began off alright  and we thought   ok this might actually be ok    but after about    minutes  we were sadly mistaken  br    br   it began when the   mysterious paint baller   turned out to be the most obvious character  the scouser australian  i say that because he had an accent which couldn  t be identified   who  s acting might i just say  was abysmal  br    br   then it got to the end  and by that time  we had all lost the will to live  the paint ball finals  br    br   the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didn  t actually win  but annoyingly enough they won by default  br    br   and i know this has nothing to do with it  but the name the team were given was just awful  critical damage  i mean they could of picked a more awesome name  like   the destroyers of the anti christ   or something  or that  s what the film should of been called anyway           insignificant and low brained  haha       s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen  yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind  the special effects are tacky  the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs    the brain   takes place in a typical quiet american town setting  where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet  it is here that a tv guru named dr  blake and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for nation wide mind controlling  under the label of   independent thinkers    a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill  how cool is that  now  it  s up to the meadowvale teen rebel to save the world  the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr  blake and his monstrous brain actually come from  there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that  s about it  meh  who needs a background in a movie like this  really  there  s not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the   evil   brain looks like an over sized sock puppet  the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie  director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made   bloody birthday    guilty pleasure of mine  and   plague    both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry  the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale  whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re animator  a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity factor and she  s obviously a great talent   she has exactly   movies on her repertoire of which this is her   masterpiece    in her debut  she was credited as   runaway model   and in     men and a baby    her character is referred to as   one of jack  s girls    i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress            does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents   one edition featured charles bronson   robbie coltrane   being interviewed about his new movie glc   br    br      it  s about a man   an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner     br    br      and after glc what next for bronson       br    br      we  re using a new angle   my family don  t get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same     br    br   this accurately describes the evil that men do   it  s a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn  t down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained  br    br   bronson is a retired hit man who isn  t giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of    the doctor      not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture   it  s never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents  br    br   as you may guess it  s a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor  s sister being a lesbian so some t a can be included  br    br   in many ways it  s like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time   but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons   believe me this movie won  t be shown until well after the watershed          well  here  s another terrific example of awkward     s film making  the rudimentary premise of   what  s the matter with helen    is quite shocking and disturbing  but it  s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion  in the hands of any other movie crew  this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale  but with director curtis harrington    whoever slew auntie roo     and scriptwriter henry farrell    hush  hush  sweet charlotte    in charge  it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres  the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific  but there  s a lot more to experience  like love stories  a swinging       s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing  the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique  we  re literally catapulted back to the       s  with a sublime depiction of that era  s music  religion  theatrical business and wardrobes  following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life imprisonment for murder  adelle  debbie reynolds  and helen  shelley winters  flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls  particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment  as she falls in love with a local millionaire  but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia  she only listens to the ramblings of a radio evangelist  fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies  the script  although not entirely without flaws  is well written and the film is adequately paced  there  s never a dull moment in   what  s the matter with helen    although the singing  tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot  but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters  she  s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who  s about to snap any second and  especially during the last ten minutes or so  she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers  jason voorhees   and michael myers   combined  there are several terrific supportive characters who are  sadly  a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential  like mich  al macliamm  ir as the cocky elocution teacher  agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies   house  there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us  but particularly the set pieces and costume designs  even nominated for an oscar   are breathtaking           resnais  wow  the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a     s french musical in vibrant colour  the opening voice over with old  embellished inter titles was a nice touch  then the camera aperture opens  like the old hand crankers  on a black   white placard  the camera backs off  or rather  up   suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party  this is all in the first    seconds  br    br   then the music starts  a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of   girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film  and yes  i speak french  so i can  t blame it on the subtitles   those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song  then they leave  and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue    minutes into the film  br    br   i  m not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time   musical cacophony  but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out  i endured  br    br   it didn  t get much better  i  ll tell you why  there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters  we don  t even see their faces half the time  as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera   people flit on   off stage like moths around a lamp  and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot  it  s as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a   hour movie  with bad songs  br    br   the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did    hour  was that i was looking at the camera techniques  lighting and scenery which were all  i admit  excellent  but is that enough to hold your attention for   hours  not me  maybe tomorrow i  ll try watching the end  aw  who am i kidding  i have more important things to do  i  m sure you do  too  skip this           i saw this movie in the middle of the night  when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch  it  s one of those films where you stop to see what it is   just for a moment    but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can  t turn it off  no matter how bad it is  one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it  s good and so bad it  s  well  just plain bad  it  s worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it  s both  great middle of the night fare  if only for the fabulous tennis drag  don  t even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male  because logic does not apply           this movie takes the plot behind the sci fi flick   doppelganger    an astronaut from our earth crashing on a   counter earth   on the opposite side of the sun  and the cold war totalitarian vibes on that world  and tries to turn it into a pilot for a tv series  however  the whole thing sank without a trace  and tv is probably better off for it  br    br   everyone here is perfectly adequate in a   made for tv   way  cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance  so does glenn corbett  who seems to be a kind of poor man  s john saxon  who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the   world order   on counter earth  br    br   but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this sci fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad  br    br   i  ll give one example  in the original template for this pilot     doppleganger     the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm  and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence  it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again   then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds  only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers  br    br   in   stranded in space    the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound  things start shaking  and the camera blurs into a blackout  and as a friend pointed out  it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats  the director wasn  t even shaking the camera or the set   i  ve seen episodes of   the twilight zone   and   the outer limits   that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made for tv mediocrity  br    br   and that  in essence  is what  s wrong with   stranded in space    no budget  no time  no imagination   just making the token gestures and hoping the sci fi fan boys   imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest  sorry  guys  it didn  t work   br    br   i  m sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away  and never thought of it again  except as a listing on their c v  and that  s what you  the viewer will do  you  ll remember  if pressed  that you once watched a tv movie called   stranded in space    but it made no lasting impression on you  and you can  t recall too much about it           black comedy isn  t always an easy sell  every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful  like fargo  for example  but usually they don  t often find big audiences  people seem to either set their minds for comedy  or for serious mayhem  there doesn  t seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both  throw momma from the train was a fairly decent hit  yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age  danny devito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in       br    br   devito plays an odd mamma  s boy named owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with  the mother is played by anne ramsey  who passed away shortly after this was released  and she is quite a caricature  she is loud  ugly  rude  and overbearing  though owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself  he wants desperately to have his mother offed  he fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes  but he clearly doesn  t have the guts to actually do it himself  that  s where billy crystal comes in  crystal plays larry donner  owen  s creative writing teacher at a nearby community college  larry is a paranoid would be intellectual novelist who claims his ex wife stole his novel and made millions off it  he is currently trying to write a new one  but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence    the night was       owen hears larry wish his ex wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria  and borrowing the idea from strangers on a train  owen decides to travel to hawai  i and murder larry  s ex wife  once it appears he has done so  he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother  the resulting action is often quite funny  and even poignant  it  s certainly never dull and often full of surprises  br    br   the acting is exceptional  even if ramsey was a bit over the top  crystal is as good as he can be  and devito has always been undervalued as a performer  the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works  often painfully so  the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes  and the off beat tone is truly refreshing  i have often been critical of the late     s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film making  throw momma from the train takes chances  both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot  how many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered  the film isn  t too long  and it is chock full of laughs  writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public  but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone    of    stars  br    br   the hound           back in       i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july   something like    days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation  weekends and the holiday itself  i stayed in town during that time  hanging out at my parents   house a lot  br    br   i didn  t have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents   tube  i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx  i was hooked instantly  i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents   family homes and through inheritances from relatives   estates  and often wondered about their history  value  etc  br    br   after my long vacation  i used to go to my folks   house on my lunch hours just to catch personal fx  br    br   i can remember one episode during which co host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the air  br    br   it never did  personal fx was the first  and best   of the collectible shows  and it vanished from the air  almost fifteen years later  i  m still sore  br    br   way to go  fx           paul verhoeven  s predecessor to his breakout hit   basic instinct   is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller  verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films  both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why  the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve  played by jeroen krabb     a gay  alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes  while there  he meets the seductive christine halsslag  ren  e soutendijk  who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him  even if it kills him  br    br   paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film  and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it  many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be  but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration  and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on  paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself  and that is one of things i like best about him  this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards  and that doesn  t happen very often    i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work   but you  ll see what i mean when you see the film  make sure you get the uncut version    there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i  ve mentioned  but are lovely nonetheless  a man gets eaten by lions  another one has a pipe sent through his skull  a boat is smashed in half   lovely  br    br   the acting in the fourth man isn  t anything to write home about  but it  s solid throughout  jeroen krabb   holds the audience  s attention and looks the part as the drunken writer  it is ren  e soutendijk that impresses the most  though  as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale  her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct  but the original fatale did it best  paul verhoeven  s direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view  all of which help to create the mystery of the story  verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish  but he obviously has talent and it  s a shame that he doesn  t put it to better use  of all the verhoeven films i  ve seen  this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across  trust me  it  s worth the effort           i accept that most     s horror aren  t scary by today  s standards  but what the hell is this  when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast  instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth    yeah which is what the people wanted  br    br   the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast    but the title really kills the movie  night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn  t any blood to speak of  br    br   i like how the     s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one  this movie isn  t the worst i  ve ever seen but its almost up there  br    br     out of             demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs  it is definitely an awful example of a film  so awful in fact that i don  t even consider it a movie  i describe it more as a thing     a monstrous thing  a thing that must be stopped at all costs  my friends and i first discovered this     thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend  s house  it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies  we unfortunately picked this one   well  during the    minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up  the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word  it  s just a cheap  poorly done rip off of evil dead  the whole   story   seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces  i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed  i  ve seen bad horror movies before  manos  troll    hobgoblins      shudder  i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity  watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films  br    br   fun fact  this film is like a cockroach on steroids  much like the ouija board  every time we try to get rid of it  it always seems to mysteriously reappear  kind of scary huh           there is a difference between a   film    and a   movie    a film  regardless of quality  is ready for public consumption  a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder  in my time as a viewer  i have seen may examples of both  br    br   on september     i attended a screening of writer director jon satejowski  s   donnybrook    now having read the script and having seen two different cuts  a rough cut and the   finished   product  of this piece  i can safely say it is a movie  and a student movie  at that  it is  for lack of a better word  competent  which is to say  the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images  the visuals are  for the most part  static and unimpressive  and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots  with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters  i understand that this is a modestly budgeted film  but some visual flair would have been appreciated  and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested  br    br   granted  there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written  engrossing story and some sharp dialog  steven soderbergh  s   sex  lies  and videotape   comes immediately to mind  this movie  however  has neither  the main story is weak and unfocused  if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father  then i feel this movie misses the point  what i got out of it is that davie  s main aspiration is to   change the face of rock   n   roll    however  we see very little activity on his part to show this  while there is one dream sequence at the beginning  and an impromptu performance of his at the end  all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar  we are simply told that davie has played a lot of gigs  but we never see him in full rock out mode  next time  show don  t tell the audience  anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this  also  davie doesn  t look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the       s  he looks like he  d be more comfortable in the early days of rock   n   roll  posing as james dean  s less talented brother  in the meantime  the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clich   characters  and story threads  that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story  are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency  i e  the subplot involving terry  s father   if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction  i will consider watching   napolean dynamite   again  a film i could barely make it through the first time  br    br   as for the above mentioned dialog scenes  i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between  is it too much to ask for characters who do speak  i don  t think it is  when the characters do speak  it is in short  choppy sentences  collections of oh so insightful questions  angered grunts or wildly over the top outbursts  these characters simply do not behave like normal  rational people  working with material like this  it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film  al hudson  s  and that  s just because he  s doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen  a good director  or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director  would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them  however  with satejowski being so close to the material  he simply doesn  t see them  or  if he does  he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it  ll hurt his creative vision  being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner  is the mark of a self indulgent  misguided fool  just ask rob schneider   br    br   in the end  we are left with a poor  high school set  knock off of zach braff  s amazing   garden state   combined with the equally amazing   velvet goldmine    two films far more worthy of your time  br    br   now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review  allow me to offer this  the best i can do is compliment mr  satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see  however  the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur  this is a student movie  nothing more  nothing less  if the movie holds any promise  and let  s face it  at this point  it isn  t going to come from the acting  writing  or directing   it is this  if  if  the people associated with this film are willing  then  please  learn from this movie  file it away  and use the lessons learned on your next attempt  don  t attack your critics  or have friend or family do it for you  if you are able to do this  maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution  worthy of being called a   film    br    br   i am your audience  and i am willing to watch           please re watch all   series and do not go see this movie  the trailer is completely misleading and the   weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out   min tv episode into the most painful  hrs of my life  truly an awful film  tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins  micky has   line  and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns  also mr briss  s accent just changes about   times in the film tons of badly acted extras  and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for   hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crap          batman and robin all is forgiven          finally  an iranian film that is not made by majidi  kiarostami or the makhmalbafs  this is a non documentary  an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the   system   in its ass  it  s all about football and its funny  its really funny  the director says   the places are real  the event is real  and so are the characters and the extras  this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors  as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness    the non actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a  your heart is made of stone b  you are blind  excellently scripted  the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness  it has won the jury grand prize  berlin        dear reader  it  s near perfect  where  where can i get hold of it           sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror  if you can just toe tap your way through the slow paced early scenes  sometimes a real gem will present itself    this  unfortunately  was not the case with   satan  s whip    br    br   written and directed by jason maran    satan  s whip   attempts to drag us along on a boring snore fest of a film  with no real pay off at the end  i  m guessing that the black   white  and blue  cinematography must have been for a reason  however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue  and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on  the story in itself is not that bad  and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic  this  combined with the slow pacing and lack of any real  red  gore made   satan  s whip   one to forget quite quickly  i will give it a       rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle  but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time           tainted look at kibbutz life br    br   this film is less a cultural story about a boy  s life in a kibbutz  but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general  in the first two minutes of the movie  the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves  and it  s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical   kibbutznikim    besides the two main characters  a clinically depressed woman and her young son  every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well  evil   br    br   the story centers on how the kibbutz  like some sort of cult  slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows  there is no happiness  no joy  no laughter in this kibbutz  every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny  hypocrisy  violence  cultism  repression etc  for example  while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking    year old boy    his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his   jewish   physical appearance and brutish personality  he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother  he treats these volunteers like trash  after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn  t seen in a long time due to his military service  he orders  quote      linda  go take shower and i cum in two minutes     br    br   there is one other   good   character in this movie    a european foreigner who plays the mother  s boyfriend  when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother  s son  the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist  s arm  he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for   violent   behavior against one of the kibbutz members  more hypocrisy  the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age     or without love and gives an account of the actual act that  s supposed to be humorous for the audience  but is really just stupid  she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy  s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse   br    br   the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult  children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders  the mother apparently can  t   escape   the kibbutz  although in reality  anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose  it  s a mystery how the boy  s father died  but you can rest assured  the kibbutz   drove him to it   and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless  wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son   br    br   that  s the gist of this movie  one dimensional characters  over dramatization  dry performances  and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience  s head    that kibbutz life was degrading  miserable and even deadly for those who didn  t   fit in    i feel sorry for the guy who made this film    obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz  but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs            when will i ever learn    the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane  please allow me to vent my spleen    br    br   i will admit  the setting  presumably new york city  has never been so downright ugly and unappealing  i am reminded that the     s was a bad decade for men  s fashion and automobiles  and all the smoking   if the plan was to cheapen the characters  it succeeded  br    br   for a film to work  at least  in my simple estimation   there has to be at least one sympathetic character  only ned beaty came close  and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky  if a stray shot had struck mikey  well  it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most  br    br   i can  t remember when i detested a film as strongly  i suppose i  m a rube who doesn  t dig   art   flicks  oh  well             lost              carnivale      desperate housewifes     the list goes on and on  these  and a bunch of other high quality  shows proves that we  re in the middle of a golden age in television history    lost   is pure genius  incredible layers of personal  and psychologically viable  stories  underscored by sublime cinematography  incredible to use this word  when describing a tv show   a killer score  great performances and editing  anyone who isn  t hooked on this  are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever  it may have its problems  when watching only one episode a week  but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this  hope they keep it up  as i  m sure they do            clifton webb is one of my favorites  however  mister scoutmaster is not one of his best  his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny  the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality  in addition  the viewer is presented with numerous ham handed references to religious faith and u s  patriotism that come off as over reverent rather than genuine  clifton webb does his best with a poor script  edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do  the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film  his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog like low voice unusual for someone of his age  however  once you  ve heard it  you  ve heard it and you don  t need to hear it again  unfortunately  he is in the majority of the film  s scenes  i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up  since he has a lot of scenes in this film  this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film  there were and are so many talented child actors  it  s a pity this film doesn  t have any of them in it  still  clifton webb in the traditional broad brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing           this is a must see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real life adventure and its sense of morality  darius goes west is an amazing roller coaster of a story  we live the lives of darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime  darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy  a disease which affects all the muscles in his body  he is confined to a wheelchair  and needs round the clock attention  so how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a       mile round trip to the west coast and back  watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure   laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way  and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises           the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses  the mythical city of everytown in      represents england in general  but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world  when war finally does arrive  it  s ravages continue not for another five years  but until      at which time everytown is completely destroyed  adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the   wandering sickness    a pestilence that continues for another four years  br    br     things to come   balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view  where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization  the   wings over the world   concept plays out a bit corny  though it  s spokesman cabal  raymond massey  is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause  if he fails  others will follow  this message is continually reinforced throughout the film  brought home convincingly in massey  s end of movie speech  man  s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an   all the universe or nothing   mindset  br    br   the film  s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film   metropolis    as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year       the spectacle of the city  s rebirth strikes a resonant chord  as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie  s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition  where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man  s first mission to the moon  but in       a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than       br    br     things to come   is one of those rarities in film  a picture that makes you think  which side will you come down on  the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo  it  s not a comfortable question  as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes  those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control           fulci    does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made  answer  yes  cat in the brain  also known as nightmare concert is fulci  s last masterpiece  yes it is  no matter what some people will say about it  there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci  s movies  br    br   fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one  lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself  who plays    well horror splatter gore director  who thinks he is slowly going insane  it  s filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here  being fulci flick  you need to know it  s gory  how much  well pretty much  i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it  but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore  and believe me  it  s a hard to archive  even the braindead didn  t stop it  citb is all about gore  almost every scene revolves about fulci  who after being hypnotized by  khmmm  evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees  some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey  and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor  which starts to spit some ooze from it  s wounds  forget the beyond or zombie    this is the goriest fulci movie  now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie  he is such a brilliant director  some funny moments and lines happens from time to time  like one where fulci says   making gore movies is kind of a sickness   ending is very good considering that fulci  and most of the italian horror masters  is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes  if you are fun of the fulci  make sure you check it out  if you have a weak stomach  avoid this and repeat   its only a movie   ps  some of the gore scenes within this movie  chainsaw dismemberment  full   tongue torn out  eyeballs torn out  maggot infested corpses  zombies  decapitations  face being putted in boiling water  stabs in the shower  to head   throat slit  many parts of the body and organs being toast aside  hammer smashed face             what an incomprehensible mess of a movie  something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom  and from the size of the jar he  s been shot about fifty times by now  and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico  whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear  and you  ll never hear another screenplay feature the word   butthorn   either  gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from   lethal weapon   and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity  william smith does another turn as a russian soldier  the same character he played in   red dawn   a few years earlier  after playing biker heavies for most of the   s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist heavies  sadly he  ll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood whupped in   every which way you can            i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors  i like raptors because they are scary  my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the   th movie with the girl who eats the banana  br    br   i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it s okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it s got a good ending even though i didn t really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that s the important part  the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you re watching it the first time  br    br   this is best movie          warning  review contains mild spoilers br    br   a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise  and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st  series  however  just two years on and i find i can  t remember enough about them in order to do it    i guess they couldn  t have made much of an impression  from what i do recall  some of the sequels    dream warriors in particular    weren  t as bad as is often made out  though even the original was no classic  generally  the predictability of the premise  if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams  doesn  t lend itself to narrative tension  but while i cannot recall much of the first five films  i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy  s dead  br    br   an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character  s demise  the fact that the movie  s conclusion is not even hidden  but in fact the entire purpose for the film  s being goes to illustrate how vacant  soulless and cynical this venture was  br    br   taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain  robert englund  s in no way scary interpretation booms with laughter  i always thought freddy  s mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe  it  s like englund  s crying out   we know this is garbage    but you  re paying to see it  so who  s the one laughing    and i  m sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight  was freddy  s appearance in the films always so rudimentary  all he gets to do here is a few   haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr    har    har    hars   and that  s it  if this was the only elm st  film you  d ever seen you wouldn  t get to know the character at all  even as the character pre death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic  ie  overstated  misplaced and not at all funny  irony  br    br   acting is almost universally poor  just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language  only kananga himself  yaphet kotto  keeps his dignity  and when roseanne  tom arnold and alice cooper show up  you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire  the script  too  is absolutely lousy  almost wholly without merit  carlos  ricky dean logan  opens a road map  upon which the noel coward like freddy has wittily written   you  re f  ked    when prompted for the map  carlos responds   well the map says we  re f  ked    who wrote the screenplay  oscar wilde  br    br   or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy  his hearing enhanced to painful levels  so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin    a potentially fatal sound  given that all sounds are magnified  oddly  the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect    nice hearing from you  carlos    quips freddy  hoping some better lines will come along  it  s also worth noting that dream sleep doesn  t occur instaneously  so being knocked unconscious wouldn  t allow instant access into freddy  s world  though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a   d finale plot logic isn  t that high on the list of requirements  br    br   the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious  dislikeable group in the whole series  tracy  lezlie deane  is the only one who gets to greet freddy with   shut the f  k up  man   and a kick in the scallops  and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients  freddy  s dead  no laughs  no scares  no interest  no fun  br    br             some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the   s  but although it is undoubtedly brutal  violent and very downbeat  this film from pou soi cheang isn  t really sleazy  lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison  however  it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch  particularly if gritty  hard edged action is your thing  br    br   edison chen plays pang  a cambodian hit man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge  sam lee is wai  the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down  whatever the cost  with wai closing in on his target  pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape  until he meets yue  a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse  br    br   a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography  amazing sound design  a haunting score  and solid performances from chen and lee  as well as newcomer pei pei as pang  s love interest   dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence  think along the lines of chan wook park  s vengeance trilogy   stabbings  shootings  merciless beatings  all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang  br    br   of course  this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved  and sure enough  pretty much everyone in this film dies  rather nasty deaths   unfortunately  there is a fine line between tragedy and  unintentional  comedy  and in its final moments  dog bite dog crosses it  in a laughably over dramatic final scene  pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on  eventually  after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas  a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on  a now dead  yue  delivering their baby moments before he himself dies  br    br   whilst this film might not be a   classic   slice of hong kong excess  with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals  it  s still worth seeking out           i watched this movie for the hot guy  and even he sucked  he was the worst one  well  okay  i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too  he was even worse  the guy wasn  t that cute in the end  he had the most terrible accent  and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can  t stand up to his mom for the one he   loves   there  s ever been  overall  and if this makes any sense to you  when i go to pick up movies at the video store  i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so so    well  at least it can  t be worse than carolina moon    the most terrible movie  and the most terrible writing  acting  plot  everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips  it was the most horrid movie i will ever see  with gabriela way up there too  i hated it  and trust me  if there was any number under   imdb had for rating  i  d choose that in a heartbeat           absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story  told with unflinching eye and with gripping style  if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people  this could change your mind  something for you feds too  a good model for government coverups  if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you           i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say  even though this movie did not get the best comments  this movie made my day  it got me thinking  what a false world this is  br    br   what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you  it  s said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake  it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance  same way some people are such that they are never grateful  this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself   br    br   a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster  the surviving brother decides to take revenge  through this process  we learn about the futility of this world  nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone  br    br   amitabh gave the performance of his life  the new actor aryan gave a good performance  the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show  her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance  chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself  br    br   a great movie by raj kumar santoshi  his movies always give some message to the audience  his movies are like novels of nanak singh  a punjabi novelist who  s novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil  because they have a real message for the audience  they are entertaining as well as lesson giving           after a very scary  crude opening which gives you that creepy   chainsaw massacre   feeling  everything falls apart  br    br   spoiler alert  as soon as the two fbi officers start jabbing  you know they are the real killers  anyone who have seen enough of these   fooled ya   movies can figure this out  br    br   this movie is mader with one thing in mind  to depict brutal murders  why  then  is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well  will this be next for us movie goers  the torture and abuse of children  whats wrong with you people  lynch is truly has a disgusting  ugly mind           i can  t say much about this film  i think it speaks for itself  as do the current ratings on here   i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it  i even  tried  to like it by watching it twice  but i just couldn  t  i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever  ever again  and i  m not one to trash a movie  but i truly believe this was awful  it wasn  t even funny in the slightest  the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them  i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me  all i can think of when i see one of their films now a days is this terrible movie  and it reminds me not to waste my money  amy poehler is so very annoying  too  br    br   overall  well  i think you get my point  the stars are for walken  by the way           i am not so old that i can  t remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times  but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells  br    br   from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead  neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line  goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better  even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades   br    br   if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was    years ago   this movie is worse  it was not even funny by accident it is sad  pathetic and a total waste of time  may goldthwaits   hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script  strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene  he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood          in new orleans  an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal blackie  walter

nico nas ruas      panic in the streets             the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it  but i soon learned that i had been duped  i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip eurotrip american pie deal  but i was wrong  this movie is one of the dumbest i  ve seen in a long time  the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you  the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy  it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building  go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead  i can  t believe national lampoon put its name on this  don  t buy it  don  t rent it  don  t waste   hours of your life on this           there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence   the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost  but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after i saw it  it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi  and at the very worst an act of murder  like most people  when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult  after seeing this  i think that koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u s  government through his eccentric actions  sure  there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound  but none of it was illegal  it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound  all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless  and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site  the clueless testimony of janet reno  and the partisan defense of the attack on waco  a defense led by a few of the committee democrats  standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u s  senator from ny charles schumer  i voted for the man when i lived in ny state   i  m a democrat  pretty left leaning too  after seeing his actions on this committee  i wish i could go back in time and vote for d  amato instead  for anyone remotely interested in the government  this is a very crucial film  a must see  i even think this should be shown in classes   it  s that important           i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent  it has it  s moments i guess you would say  some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool  and some of the location shots were very authentic  i won  t be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting  i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre  the action is good  the acting is decent  the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion  and the story is pretty interesting    out of ten          yes  i call this a perfect movie  not one boring second  a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors  a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with  perfect lighting  crisp black and white photography  a fitting soundtrack  an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works  it  s one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest  the mark everyone should endeavor to reach  br    br   barbara stanwyck is simply stunning  there was nothing this actress couldn  t do  and she always went easy on the melodramatic side  no hysterical outbursts with this lady   i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford  and this movie confirmed my opinion  always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments  it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career  and this one is by far the least interesting  br    br   the title fits this movie very well  it is about desires  human desires i think everyone can understand  actually  no one seems to be scheming in this movie  all characters act on impulse  everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else  the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here  br    br   i liked what this movie has to say about youth  about maturing and about the necessity to compromise  the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock  s shadow of a doubt  it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america  the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang  s considerably harsher movie clash by night  made one year earlier  where stanywck stars in a similar part  i can also recommend it           i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie    that  s the way of the world    it  s been about    years since i  ve seen this movie  and i would like to see it again  earth wind   fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes  it was unfortunate that this group didn  t take off like their counterparts in the early     s  but as previously stated  racial tension existed in the united states which prohibited equalized exposure for the african american musical groups  it is good to see that earth wind   fire continuing their success  i would like to add this movie to my collection  someone please help me if possible  thank you for your attention  milton shaw          i saw the movie   hoot   and then i immediately decided to comment it  the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet  some people think that if they have money  they can do whatever they want to  which probably is like  but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful  this movie is not just about kids  this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do  when i was twelve  i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn  t even dare to touch them not fearing of the law  but fearing that i might harm them actually   i am currently     what so ever  the acting was great  the   main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them  i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie    and enjoy           i had some reservations about this movie  i figured it would be the usual bill of fare     a formula movie about christmas  being in the middle of a heat wave in late june  we decided to give it a shot anyway  maybe we would see some snow  br    br   this movie turned out to be one laugh after another  ben affleck was believable in his character  but the real star of this one is james gandofini  he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great   dad    br    br   if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours  definitely check this one out           when i first saw this film around   months ago  i considered it interesting  but little more  but it stuck with me  that interest grew and grew  and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself  i purchased the criterion dvd box set  and it turns out that i was right the second time  alexander nevsky is a great film  it is rousing  and i  m sure it succeeded in its main aim  propaganda against the germans  br    br   that is the most common criticism against this film  and against eisenstein  that it is merely propagandist and nothing else  it  s untrue  he is an amazing film artist  one of the most important whoever lived  by now  the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein  s films as art           focus is another great movie starring william h  macy  i first discovered macy in fargo and i  ve seen a few of his films and he hasn  t yet deceived me  macy is the archetypal   nice guy with something to hide    in focus  he plays the role of lawrence newman  a loyal and hard working stiff  who harbours his handicapped mother at home  the scene is set after world war ii  at the height of mccarthyism  newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically  anti semite  after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent  he is asked to buy a pair of glasses  to improve his failing eyesight  br    br   unbelievably  the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart  his wife  played by a great laura dern   as the film unravels  newman will begin to see a whole different world  where being jewish is akin to being an animal  br    br   the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal  the chilling thought is that in some places  it probably still is           in   brave new girl    holly comes from a small town in texas  sings   the yellow rose of texas   at a local competition  and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia  from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty  i loved this movie  it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace  the acting was  of course  wonderful  virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding  as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end  it seems a sequel could be in the making   kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production  quite a gem in the film archives           despite a totally misleading advertising campaign  this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clich  d  sub par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending  clue    for all considering seeing this turkey  sam raimi didn  t direct it  although commercials for the movie play up his involvement  in truth he is one of four producers  it  s too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie  i don  t think he would ever have directed something like this  that task was left to the pang brothers  br    br   the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other   horror   films  so you  ll find absolutely zero original content in   the messengers    what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of   pulse    a couple that could have come from   the birds    one or two from   the others    etc  nearly every scene  almost every line of dialogue  is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies  the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the   surprise ending   long before it comes  br    br   right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign  centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts  has nothing to do with this movie  in fact  everyone can see the ghosts  the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them  even quite early in the movie  i  m sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal  which otherwise is entirely absent  now you know  so don  t be fooled  perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors  it simply isn  t there  all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted  coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes  just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened  anyhow  didn  t anyone think to maybe arrest him    it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots  loud noises  visual flashes  and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling   boo    all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house  if there  s any message that   the messengers   delivers  it  s   don  t waste your time on this movie             this movie sucks ass  something about a heatwave in some european country  complete trash  there  s nothing going for this movie whatsoever  maybe    seconds of sex but that  s it  there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off  this movie is complete rash and you shouldn  t subject yourself to watching it  i regret it it  s very boring  i would rate it zero but i can  t  no body in their right mind should see this  i  m sure you  ll regret it completely i did  how could they think up something this bad  even mystery men was better  mystery men  that sucks  that movie wasn  t worth being made  complete waste of time  the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored           i was looking forward to the guardian  but when i walked into the theater i wasn  t really in the mood for it at that particular time  it  s kind of like the olive garden   i like it  but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it  br    br   i  m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit  the trailers looked good  but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject   waterworld  plus  despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect  i  m still not completely sold on him  something about the guy just annoys me  probably has to do with his simian features  br    br   it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away  the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission  and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers   orange face lift  my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher  s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious  sunglasses  a tough guy toothpick in his mouth  and sportin   a smirk that  d make george clooney proud  yeah  we get it  i was totally ready to hate him  br    br   but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs   br    br   darn you  ape man  efficiently mixing tense  exciting rescue scenes  drama  humor  and solid acting  the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy  you can quibble about its clich  s  predictability  and rare moments of overcooked sappiness  but none of that takes away from the entertainment value  br    br   i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys  but on the contrary  the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film  coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen  so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group  br    br   do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer  just think about it  you get to go on dangerous missions in cold  dark  rough water  and then you must fight disorientation  exhaustion  hypothermia  and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded  panicked people who are depending on you for their survival  and if all that isn  t bad enough  sometimes you can  t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies  br    br   man  who wants all that responsibility  not me  i had no idea what it was really like for these guys  and who would have thought i  d have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education   br    br   not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero  but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers  br    br   the gist  br    br   moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it  s like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance  i saw it for free  but had i paid i would  ve felt i had gotten my money  s worth           going into see seven pounds i wasn  t clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about  so within the first    min or so you are completely lost in the plot  have no idea what is going on and you think tim  who claims to be ben  is just a big asshole  all of this comes to an end when the   twist   so to speak  is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie  basically tim  will smith  was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives  by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to  br    br   the acting of this film is great  as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress  rosario dawson  to me  this is one of her better movies  aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to  she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film  other actors  such as woody harrelson  have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character  although the casting of the film was still good  br    br   this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped  the movie  however  was still pretty good  nothing is revealed until the last   min of the movie and everything falls into place  up until then it just seems like a pointless love story  final thought seven pounds seven stars           i saw brother  s shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it  judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son  the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn  he shows up there because his brother has died  and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother  s wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family  the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives  also  the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait             marar  xada   really disappointed me  i can  t consider it as a bad movie  but the development just seemed too rushed and non believable for it to evoke any emotions  dr  ferm  xadn displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can  t really understand where it was born from  i mean  how many times does he ever have a conversation with marar  xada   maybe once  also  marar  xada never appeared to be a real character  instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie     or else another title was needed    some of the best acting came from a role that wasn  t really important to the story  that of marcial  the sub intelligent yet humble drunkard  of course  the scenery  the cultural tidbits of the canary islands  and other   wow   moments were interesting  but the movie fell short of a documentary  in case this was its real intention   and most importantly  as a solid drama           serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind  instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains  the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems  there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters  the mad doctor  s nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy  the results are not good  this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors  there isn  t much zombie action in this one and the effects  while adequate  are nothing special  you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes  watch out for some nudity and bad language          witty  funny  intelligent  awesome  i was flipping channels late one night years ago  came across this and a wildfire started  i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know  a few  like   people out of the almost     people i made watch this didn t think it was as awesome as i did  the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time  please do yourself a favor  run don t walk  watch this and enjoy  intelligence and humor  it s a win win situation  i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of    sanechaos          it  s a unique film  as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory  because he seems so reserved   detached he  s perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter of factly uses all those around him  however in the deadly serious  no pun intended  last act  when coward must make like the flying dutchman  he  s much less comfortable  br    br   but his way with an epigram is peerless  and hecht   macarthur have given him some gems  macarthur  really    he was the wit of the pair   br    br   the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes  but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence  hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing    getting their dialogue on screen   note  h m themselves have blink and you  ll miss   em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene   br    br   the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott  notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward  who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward  br    br   curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table  of which he was a founder  and macarthur something of an auxiliary member  br    br   the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story  though that victory is probably due more to coward  s imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot  it  s coward  woolcott  and the dialogue you remember             this is definitely a   must see   film  the excellent director alain chabat  also acting as ceasar  has managed to capture the very essence of the   adventures of ast  rix    the french comic books it  s based upon  and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy  which is also an homage to the world of animated films  this movie is so funny  so full of jokes  both visual and spoken  that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all  between your bursts of laughter  the only drawback is that a non french audience  or at least a non french speaking audience  might not get all the   private jokes    there are so many dialogues impossible to translate  so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life  that the fun might be lessened  however  it  s still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture  the amazing stunts  the music  the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting  all actors are great  but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze  g  rard darmon and edouard baer  and please don  t ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books     ast  rix et ob  lix contre c  sar   and directed by claude zidi           i thought this movie was stunning  with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi  artemisia gentileschi   br    br   cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully  with tentative yet confidant mannerisms  her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place  the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch  br    br   although not each character was overtly beautiful  this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time  br    br   overall i thought this film was fantastic           i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling   gentleman jim   the best boxing movie ever made  that is the robert wise paul newman flick   somebody up there likes me    that movie might be number    but   gentleman jim   is a close number    br    br   the movie doesn  t just chronicle the rise of james j  corbett  it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition  in the late     s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare knuckle rules to the more   gentlemanly   days of the gloved  marquis of queensbury rules  and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability  br    br     gentleman jim   is not a realistic look at those days  it is romanticized and  yes  even a bit hokey at times  but always delightfully so  errol flynn is perfect as the   gentleman   jim who really isn  t a   gentleman   at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family  alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love hate relationship  and we all know it is  of course  love that will win that match in the end   br    br   at the end of   gentleman jim   the great john l sullivan  whose famous line was not   i can lick any man in the world   of course   romanticism again  hands over his belt to corbett  this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made  realistic  no  but wonderful  hey  if you want realism watch   raging bull   instead  that is a much more realistic boxing movie  but   gentleman jim   is a lot more fun           that this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that god is truly dead  am i the only one that really saw  rather sleptwalked  through this   film    this is the only movie i  ve ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back    it was just that dull  and i even saw   highlander    the quickening   at the local cinema  from beginning to end  gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies  cast together by circumstance  who eventually work together as best buddies  the action  what little there is  is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer  thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our   cinema   that there  s no chance for an   air america               well  there  s no real plot to speak of  it  s just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex  which can sometimes be fun  too  but it  s not in this case   what else can i say about this     the action  when happening  is inventive and there  s a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper  one that has to be several miles high   but overall there  s not much to recommend   kite    watch it if you want  but you  re not missing much if you skip this one             this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven  t seen any of the others  there are the usual ingredients  it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts  we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet t shirt contests quite frequently  the story is just laughably idiotic  and the film takes itself much too seriously  and then  orang utans in africa  br    br   but it has a few things going for it  bo looks great  the production values  sets  costumes  etc   are quite good  and this greatly enhances its camp value  in a strange way it is actually quite funny  simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly           some people drift through life  moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye  others latch on to a cause  another person or a principle and remain adamant  committed to whatever it is   and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it  but we  re all different   made of different clay    as one of the characters in this film puts it  which is what makes life so interesting  some people are just plain crazy  though   and maybe that  s the way you have to be to live among the masses  who knows  who knows what it takes to make things   life   work  writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it  using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed   and how one  gets   committed   and obsession  in  committed    starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant  committed  obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy  too  her name is joline  and this is her story  br    br    tadmittedly  joline has always been a committed person  in work  relationships  in life in general  she  s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what  and when she marries carl  luke wilson   it  s forever  the only problem is  someone forgot to tell carl   and     days into the marriage  he  s gone  off to  find   himself and figure it all out  when joline realizes he  s not coming back  she refuses to give up on him  or their marriage  maybe it  s because of that  clay   she  s made of  regardless  she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him  which she does   in el paso  texas  of all places  but once she knows where he is  she keeps her distance  giving him his  space   and not even letting him know she  s there  she considers carl as being in a  spiritual coma    and it  s her job to keep a  spiritual vigil   over him until he comes to his senses  and while she watches and waits  her life is anything but dull  as she encounters a young woman named carmen  patricia velazquez   a waitress at one of the local eateries  carmen  s  grampy     alfonso arau   who is something of a mystic  t bo  mark ruffalo   a truck driver who has issues concerning carl  and neil  goran visnjic  an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her  for joline  it  s a journey of discovery  during which she learns a lot about carl  but even more about herself  br    br    tthere  s a touch of humor  a touch of romance  and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot  and krueger presents it all extremely well  delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining  her characters are very real people  with all the wants  needs and imperfections that make up the human condition  a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story  we see it from joline  s point of view  as krueger makes us privy to joline  s thoughts and therefore her motivations  which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold  that  along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates  makes for a very effective piece of storytelling  there  s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter  but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters  and the result is a well textured  affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life  br    br    theather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation  she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable  adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person  and one that is real  and for this film to work  it was imperative that joline be viable and believable   and graham succeeds on all fronts  her screen presence has never been more alluring  and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes  is enough to draw you in entirely  it  s all a part of the character she creates  there  s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance  who she is inside and out  she  s a likable  agreeable person  and because you  ve shared her innermost thoughts  you know who she is  it  s a good job all the way around  beginning with the way the character was written  to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life  br    br    tas carmen  patricia velazquez is totally engaging  as well  her performance is very natural and straightforward  and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character  she has a charismatic presence  but is less than flamboyant  and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth  she is refreshingly open and up front  you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back  but is totally honest on all fronts  and that  too  is part of her appeal  and  as with joline  this character is well written  and velazquez brings her convincingly to life  br    br    toverall  there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film  including those of luke wilson  casey affleck  as joline  s brother  jay   goran visnjic  alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo  who  with very little actual screen time  manages to create a memorable character  br    br    tthe supporting cast includes kim dickens  jenny   clea du vall  mimi   summer phoenix  meg   art alexakis  new york car thief   dylan baker  carl  s editor   and mary kay place  psychiatrist   a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture   reflecting upon who we are  where we  re going and what we really need    committed   is an enjoyable experience  a ride definitely worth taking                 ho hum  an inventor  s horst buchholz deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands  unknowingly his son luke perry has been working on the antedote all along  enter cia agent olivia d  abo and the cat and mouse car chases and gunfire begins  also in the cast are tom conti  hendrick haese and an aging roger moore  moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts  perry fans will be accepting  d  abo is wrong for the role  but nice to look at           note to self  never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it  great comedian  horrible seal  this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when  in fact  they are the most elite form of military in the world  charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation  thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen  this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie  but why charlie sheen  there are possibilities for a very passionate story here  but sheen decides to wreck them with   funny   comments           this movie is stupid  there  s no getting around it  but so is dumb and dumber  mind you  dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this  however  i for one love seeing stupid movies  tail sting  and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is  call me callous  but see this movie  and you  ll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it           i was looking forward to this so much  being a big fan of the book  however  when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i  ve ever spent at the cinema  br    br   in principle  the acting  the sets and the music were excellent  and are the main reason why i  m rating this a    br    br   in this version  sara is a little too self sacrificing for my taste  there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls  in the book she makes a point of describing lies as   not just wicked  but vulgar     br    br   there  s also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me  sara  s father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset  while the book does have a happy  and critics might say equally improbable  ending  it doesn  t leave you thinking    oh puh leeze    br    br   about the only things true to the book were  br    br      sara  s father being a soldier    the lines between sara and her father    are you learning me by heart      no  i know you by heart  you are inside my heart        sara  s friendship with becky  and her   adopting   lottie  although this last one wasn  t developed as much as it could have been     the changing of her room by adding various luxury items  that part was brilliantly done     the basic core   a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly   is there  but that  s about all that is  br    br   people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience  possibly  all i can say to that is i have two cousins   aged   and    respectively   who were big fans of this film until they read the book  br    br   if all you want is a   feel good   family film  then this delivers  if you  re looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess  in fact  if you  ve read the book  don  t waste time with this one  it  s such a shame  with a cast like this  if they  d stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic  br    br   am i harping on about   read the book   this and   read the book   that a little too much  very probably  but if someone attempts to adapt a book   especially such a classic   into a movie  then they should at least have done the same thing  preferably more than once           as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless  tv told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early     s and made everyone look bad  and claimed we all made over      a day when        a day was much closer to reality  when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work  and offered me work  i actually went and took the work if i was physically able and if i would been offered the          id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least   years  and kept most in the bank and still left myself           for nl      and      cash games at the casinos  i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll  instead i win about       a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all  i was only homeless cause i didn  t wanna risk spending all my money and going broke  sometimes i had over            in my sock while i slept outside  anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard     on yahoo messenger i admit i was different than most homeless people though  due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs  im no longer homeless  am now in govt housing for      a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning at online poker  mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi  glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping  worrying about getting caught by security are finally over  had this tv crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner  its a shame how they don  t better select who they pick           i really in enjoyed watching this movie  like most of the people that watched it  i wasn  t sure that i was getting  whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies  i e  sister act  br    br   however this was not really comedy  it is a drama with comedic moments  so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking  br    br   this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood  i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie  this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks  but also about relations with in the black community  i do think that it is worth a chance  if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn  t for you          having been a marine  i can tell you that the d i  is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men  jack webb is excellent as sgt jim moore  a tough  but fair drill instructor in paris island north carolina  the film centers on one recruit who doesn  t seem to   get with the program    a more recent film  full metal jacket  also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing           every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie  this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be  br    br   the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what  s going on and you really want to view it for the second time  but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be  br    br   a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie  this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie  in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b  bs and lots of blood  br    br   if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts    ch  without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation  and don  t forget to switch the light off  br    br   my points on different aspects   br    br   direction        acting        atmosphere         sound effect        br    br   total                 ken burns     baseball   is a decent documentary    it presents a clear origin of the game  a great depiction of baseball  s early years and heroes  there  s plenty in this movie for any baseball fan    that said  the film has several glaring flaws  br    br      hours is simply too long for the human attention span  it  s clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his   nine inning   concept  it  s not even a tight    hours    the pace on every segment is slow  almost morose    the music always nostalgic and wistful  isn  t baseball ever exciting and fun  why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy  talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak  yakking about baseball as a metaphor  baseball as americana  the psychology and theology of baseball    enough  this is syrupy  mawkish drivel  billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he  s sold us before  ken burns uses the national anthem as the series   theme song  and manages to play   take me out to the ballgame   so many times you might vomit  we get it  dude  br    br   clearly burns is a neo hollywood faux liberal  so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues    these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open minded as kenny is today  for shame  he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times  burns falls head over heels in love with buck o  neil  a former negro league player  and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o  neil waxes poetic about his playing days  nonsense    br    br   burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down    baseball   winds up as mushy  gushy  civil rights propaganda disguised as americana  its clear that burns is not a baseball fan    otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering  not weeping and reciting soliloquies    are you listening  mr  burns  there  s no crying in baseball             quitting   may be as much about exiting a pre ordained identity as about drug withdrawal  as a rural guy coming to beijing  class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents   acting success  troubles arise  however  when the new man is too new  when it demands too big a departure from family  history  nature  and personal identity  the ensuing splits  and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other  hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim  br    br   but what an exceptionally convincing particularity  honesty  and sensuousness director zhang yang  and his actors  bring to this journey  no clich  s  no stereotypes  no rigid gender roles  no requisite sex  romance or violence scenes  no requisite street language and  to boot  no assumed money to float character acts and whims   br    br   hongshen jia is in his mid twenties  he  s a talented actor  impressionable  vain  idealistic  and perhaps emotionally starved  the perfect recipe for his enablers  soon he  s the   cool   actor  idolized by youth    he was hot in the early nineties      he always had to be the most fashionable    he needs extremes  and goes in for heavy metal  adopts earrings and a scarf  his acting means the arts  friends  and roles  but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input  and his self criticism  dulled by the immediacy of success  opens the doors to an irrational self doubt  self hatred     i didn  t know how to act     i felt like a phony    and to readily available drugs to counter them  he says   i had to get high to do what director wanted    so  his shallow identity as an actor becomes  via drugs  an escape from identity   br    br   hongshen  s disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual  intermittent  and doggedly his own  solitude  space  meditative thinking  speech refusal  replace therapy  the abstract is out  and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors   not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways  bridges  and high rises of beijing  the physicality is almost romantic  but is not  the bike rides to ritan park  the long spontaneous walks  the drenching sun and rain  grassy picnics  the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific  he drifts in order to arrive  all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity    i started to open up   he says of this period in retrospect  and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer  s positioning  clumsy  graceful  humorous  telling  in a current circumstance  if mind or spirit is lacking  his legs can compel him to walk all night   br    br   central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles  to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity  he smashes his videos and tv  and bangs his head till bloody against his   john lennon forever   poster  he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist   but he  s the only viable guide he knows  he even imagines himself as john  s son  yoko ono   and adopts his   mother mary   as an intercessor in his   hour of darkness   and   time of trouble     the wrenching  shaking pain in the park  hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals    music is so much more real than acting   he says  and speaks of lennon  s influence as   showing me a new way    in the mental institute  the life saving apples  resistance  nourishment  reflect lennon  s presence  as does hongshen  s need to re hang his hero  s poster in his redecorated room  br    br   if lennon  s influence is spiriting  hongshen  s father  s influence is grounding  although father and son are both actors and users  drugs and drink   it is fegsen  s differences from his son that underwrites his change  for the father is more secure in himself  he accepts that he  s chinese  a peasant in a line of peasants  a rural theater director  and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions  it  s this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board  sometimes with anger and rage  sometimes with humor  the blue jeans  beatles  and passivity  in his most crazed  and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar  and a fake  he exposes more of himself than his father    all the acts i acted before were bullshit    life is bullshit    and to hongshen  s emphatic   you are not my father    he softly replies    why can  t a peasant be your father     br    br   under these two teachers and with much additional help from his mother  sister  friends  inmates at the rehab inst   he makes some tangible connection to a real  not whole  self  as the long term drug effects recede  so does his old identity  indebtedness replaces pride  trust distrust  integrity banishes his black cloud  all his edges soften    you are just a human being   he repeats endlessly after being released from the strap down incurred for refusing medicine  back home  lard peasant soap is fine with him now  and his once   rare and true friendships   begin again as is so evident in the back to poignant back to back fence scene with his musician buddy  hongshen says of this movie    it  s a good chance to think about my life    and i might add  become a new actor  one bound to art and life  like lennon  he has gained success without a loss of identity           i have watched this movie countless times  and never failed to be charmed by it  s homely simplicity  sincerity and goodness  great characterizations by all of the cast  and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role i confess i fell in love with roberta in       and she still touches me today  shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day  the nicest present i could have had           if only i had read the review by alex sander  sic  on here rather than looking at the rating of over   from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration  alien was a fantastic  dramatic and well made horror sci fi  predator was a great sci fi action mess about  i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw   alien versus predator    it too has an average grading of over   stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site  br    br   stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you  br    br   right from the beginning this film was ridiculous  no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun not overrun by aliens  ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology  the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why  from then on it gets really ridiculous  i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out  i couldn  t here  br    br   a father and son are hunting in the woods  the damaged ship crash lands to  from the view given  i would calculate at the very least    odd miles away through thick woodland  the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged  even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible  dumb redneck muppet  br    br   an edgy  thriller type scenario is introduced with an ex con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless  dull now cop friend from the bus  when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out  a slasher horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective  crazy  nasty jock type  american sportsman not a scottish man   oh the cute not cute boy is the ex con  s brother by the way  yes they  re clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again  then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc  ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child  br    br   guess what happens next  i won  t tell you much more about the actual  smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films  plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien ridden universe  br    br   the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late  the aliens are boring  the predator alien is ridiculous  the action is at times exploitative  gratuitous  disgusting nonsense  the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers     oh i was shocked alright  shocked at how low some people will go to get what  a scare  some shock  to titillate the perverse  what  if you really wanted to shock  titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them  the characters have no depth and neither does the plot  it  s filmed and paced badly  it  s acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them  it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci fi characters  this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you  if you haven  t seen it then well please make your own decision  br    br   ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about    seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout           even though i saw this film when i was very young  i already knew the story of wild the thief taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison  br    br   apart from the liberty taken right at the end  the film more or less faithfully follows the true story  the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that  br    br   of the performances  there is scarcely a poor performance  and tommy steele is ideally cast  also good is stanley baker as the thief taker and alan badel is good as always  br    br   because the film sticks to the facts  it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family           gone is the wonderful campiness of the original  in place is a c grade action no brainer  wich is not all bad  but pales in comparison to the original  all the meaningless sex and violence is gone  and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot pointers  see it  but don  t expect the thrills of the first           although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars  alec guinness produced an amazing body of work  particularly in the     s     s  ranging from dramas to quirky comedies  i particularly love his comedies  as they are so well done and seem so natural and real on the screen  far different from the usual fare from hollywood  br    br   this being said  this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies  it  s plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere  except for ealing studios  which had a particular fondness for   little   films like this one  br    br   guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company  he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible  though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work  so  he tends to sneak into labs  either during the day if no one suspects or at night  and try his hand at inventing  repeatedly  he is caught  such as after he blew up the lab  and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds  then  despite the importance of the discovery  he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events  and then the fun begins  br    br   the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry  unions  the government and people in general           victor mclaglen  s performance is one of the finest in film history  br    br   i think we can all feel for   gypo   because we  ve all struggled with what is right and what isn  t and been wrong  this was one of the first art house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio  rko radio pictures   br    br   joseph h  august  s cinematography is at its very best here  however  august  s stunning portion was mostly overlooked  he didn  t receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved  br    br   this is a psychological drama  with thought  philosophy  sadness  all conveyed with as little words as possible           how do you take a cast of experienced  well known actors  and put together such a stupid movie  nimrod antel has the answer  armored  six co workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves  but  just as they get to first base with their plans  everything unravels quickly  with a plot like this  you  d think it couldn  t be too bad  at least for an action movie  however  in the first    minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be   normal  everyday kind of guys  they joke  they laugh  have a few drinks together  etc  then  we suddenly learn they  re planning to rob their own business  the hero ty   columbus short   is sucked into the scheme because of the cold  cruel world  even though he  s a decorated veteran  nice guy  and reliable employee  oh my  oh my  then in the last    minutes of the film  these former regular guys nearly all turn into money crazed psychos  willing to butcher each other for cash  in the last scenes mike   matt dillon   goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend  the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty  it  s utterly unbelievable and   b movie   is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot  i would say don  t waste your time  too bad no one gave laurence fishburne  jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture           the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn  it  s peak years were between      and       one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle  who had a small but fanatic cult of followers  she was actually able to act  unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks  and her subsequent credits proved it  and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique  br    br   gary graver  the director  was also a talent  probably too talented for the sexploitation genre  and his skill  combined with monica gayle  s screen presence  makes sandra  the making of a woman  a pleasantly enjoyable experience  the film never drags and you won  t have your finger pressed on the fast forward button           what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be  this is the type of film that i  ve been looking for ages  particularly important for me was the fantastic looking chicago  which i still keep thinking about  the back cover doesn  t do this film justice  it  s superb  and in my top   for sure           i did not expect much from this film  but boy o boy  i did not expect the movie to be this bad  chris rock is not showing a good act here  you can  t get the feeling that his caracter is real  i think the movie would have been a bit better if it  s drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved  the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it  in the   making of   they don  t show a single smile  this is a very bad film  i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me  but i did never laugh           i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie  i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen  it my have been b c i am mel brooks biggest fan    i know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them  when it is played on a family channel     this is one of my favorite movies  so i dont know why any one would disagree  thanks kristina          flynn  known mostly for his swashbuckling roles  and his bedroom antics   takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully  playing real life boxing champ jim corbett  flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist  all the while setting one eye on society deb smith  he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men  and a dog   including a prominent judge  the next day  he gets a chance  via smith  to gain entrance to the judge  s private club  he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club  s resident boxer  his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers  up to and including the world champion john l  sullivan  bond   flynn is downright magical here  he is the epitome of charm  charisma and appeal in this role  he looks terrific  especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit  and does virtually all of his own stuntwork  impressively   his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally  smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn  at this stage  he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation  he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time  and she does so admirably  she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude  yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell  bond is incredibly burly  brawny and towering  yet tender when the script calls for it  amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson  frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn  s manager  the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn  s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types  the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed  a few of the sets are amazingly presented  some of smith  s gowns border on the garish  but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well  it  s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing  but it  s also so much more  some of it  like the character traits shown by flynn  is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes  but a lot of it is authentic  like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes   one line is particularly memorable    i believe you like me more than i like you  but it  s entirely possible that i love you more than you love me    it  s classic romantic dialogue  and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well            often laugh out loud funny play on sex  family  and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it  s seen since the days of granny and jed clampett  plot centers on two chauffers who  ve bet on which one of them can bed his employer  both single or soon to be single ladies  quite sexy    bisset and woronov  first  if manuel wins  his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang    if he loses  he must play bottom man to his friend   br    br   lots of raunchy dialogue  fairly sick physical humour  etc  but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface  bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy  teenaged niece on a year long   missionary trip   to africa  br    br   hilarious fun           thought provoking  humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war  a small  but altruistic view of one family  s interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky  this movie lessens the   glamor   of war  showing it  s effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit  br    br   a lot of today  s movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the   hero  s   and other glamorous features of war  but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community  this movie attempts this through a retelling of a person  s memory of those days  this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events  when in reality  this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds  perhaps thousands of   actual events   during the civil war  i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie           or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by     s flicks  br    br   i mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets  med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost  flatliners  bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past  very bad things  groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies  sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts  br    br   noble idea totally fubarred in it  s execution           elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies  it has every thing you would want in a film  like great one liners  sexy star and a outrageous story  if you have not seen it  you are missing out on one of the greatest films made  i can  t wait till her new movie comes out           i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful  especially since it was based on a true man  pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl  the photography was beautiful  br    br   this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl  i want to read as much as i can about him  at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it  but i am not surprised  i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing  i gave it the highest rating  however  i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house  br    br   you can  t go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes           despite having an absolutely horrid script  more about that later   this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors  barbara stanwyck and henry fonda  aside from one or two real stinkers  i  d probably watch just about anything with them in the film  as i am a huge fan of hollywood  s golden age of the     s and   s  however  no matter how much i love their films  i just can  t recommend this film  br    br   the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort  the two haven  t yet met  but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing  it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but i stuck it out  especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling   in hindsight  perhaps i should have just turned it off then  fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help  back at the ski lodge  he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x rayed and nurses him back to health  he  in turn  becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her  despite hardly knowing each other  they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy  br    br   once home  however  all isn  t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy  the film plays it all for laughs  but frankly fonda  s behaviors were really creepy  spying on her and her male patients  attacking or threatening any man she treats  tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there  men and women  are out to steal away his wife  he comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic  but it  s all supposed to be for laughs  considering that he seems like a dangerous nut  you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order  but  oddly  she gets mad but just can  t stay mad at fonda because he  s so          i can  t think of the right word    creepy   is all that comes to mind    later  out of the blue  multi millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store  then  through magical thinking  he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past  so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions  when this job falls through  the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital  giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after  they don  t go any further with the story  but i assume based on fonda  s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients  br    br   the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together  nor did the final   horatio alger   inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world  they were like three separate plots but despite this  the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy  what a creepy little film  thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films          i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all  br    br   in this case however i have to say it was bad  i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second  br    br   there was no proper storyline  i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces  br    br   the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these   pieces is scary  half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third  a   year old kid would have been able to put them together  br    br   this movie was bad  br    br   dominic         i was debating between this movie and      but chose inglourious basterds due to it  s amazingly high imdb rating  i must say now  what a disappointment  i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence  but i also expected a lot of witty dialog  i got a huge dosage of the former  but not nearly enough of the latter  i felt shortchanged  the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong  and the plot  it  s that believable or really all that entertaining either  save your time and money  i can  t believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses           bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line  it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team  there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives  i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve  the song choices are really good    hush my child  just move on up   to your destination and you make boundaries and complications    anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review  bend it like beckham great flick          directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz  a young mother selma lidz andie macdowell is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid john tururro is a little lacking in the emotions department  unhappy with the new home situation  their sensitive son steven nathan watt decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny michael richards and melvin lou cutell until his mom is well  steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle  s living habits  he even decides he wants to change his name to franz  set in the early     s  this drama is a bit comedic   change that to zany  not being a macdowell fan  unstrung heroes assures my attitude  albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste           perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger  s   where the sidewalks ends    from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel   night cry   by frank rosenberg    br    br   dana andrews is the honest  tough new york policeman  always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks    when he hit someone  his knuckles hurt    and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain  gary merrill  who points up the title    why are you always trying to push me in the gutter    he asks andrews    i have as much right on the sidewalk as you    br    br   dana andrew  s obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden  painful discovery that he is the son of a thief    his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them  and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta    br    br   by a twist of irony unique to the film itself  dana andrews and gene tierney of   laura   are united once more  and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later  but no longer the romantic  beaten down by his job  by the cheap crooks    this time  he goes too far  and accidentally kills a suspect    the killing is accidental  the victim worthless  yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail    br    br   using his knowledge of police procedure  he covers up his part in the crime  plants false clues  and tries to implicate a gang leader  but cannot avoid investigating the case himself    the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder  is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical  satisfying  and in no way a compromise    br    br   the film is one of the best detective films of the     s  with curious moral values  also one of preminger  s best     br    br   preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique  projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism             in sum  overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes  the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres   in this case drama and comedy  well  at least here  these two mix like vinegar and oil  to boot  the comedy is not very funny and juvenile  additionally  the film is not really realistic  liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals  i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on  eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover  s son  by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover  marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover  at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them   either ismael or primarily nora  to the detriment of the audience  viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael  her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital  there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed  the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball  s chance in hell  the actors do their best and are appealing  but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing  editing and lack of focus           incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane  leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path    i know there are several versions of this  and this is based on the     min   one that i watched   but i can  t fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck  br    br   i  d heard for long about the alleged   shocking   content of sex nudity  which honestly there isn  t much of here at all   and boring when there is  and blood  but beware   it  s the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here  everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project  camera work is hopelessly inept  full of strange zooms  failed framing and confusing pans  to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage   complete with a grainy  cheapish photo quality  lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven   is it day or night  are they in  or outside  have they changed scenes  who is  or is meant to be in the shot  editing is the final sin here  making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways  continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum  story progression   and involvement  there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story    but these faults distract so much it  s tragic  br    br   a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan  burnt  and fellini like  turkey that  s only good for a few gobble laughs and peter o  toole  who makes a most memorable tiberius  oh yes  which brings us to the big name actors  i  d like to line them all up one by one and just ask  who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this  there  i  ve wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time   period  br    br     out of    from ozjeppe          did anyone edit this film  or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes  it  s ok though  i fell asleep watching it the first time  then i fell asleep the second time and the third time  the plot is actually not the worst i  ve seen  but it  s close  the acting is not the worst i  ve seen either   but it  s close  the production      well  i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life  not trying to be spiteful  but unhinged could have used some more production  br    br   please don  t think i  m a hater of horror films  or even that i didn  t enjoy this film  i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it  the gruesome moments were not too poorly done  but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget  br    br   characters seemed awkwardly developed  or ignored all together  twist ending was pretty bad  and the exposition took forever without exposing much  br    br   i  d recommend avoiding this movie  br    br                 riding high on the success of   rebel without a cause    came a tidal wave of   teen   movies  arguably this is one of the best  a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen  the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency  than any traumatic occurrence  the supporting cast is memorable  frankenheimer directs like an old pro  just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously           most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance  i came out of this movie wondering what was going on  i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie  i intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious  i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back  movie reviewers and critics love this movie  which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film  the    rating this movie has is so misleading  in    years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather  the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn  t enough to save the film   nor are the lesbian scenes            pepe le moko  played by charles boyer  is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe  and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah  a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go  until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all  for le moko  although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody  it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time   a place he can  t leave  because the moment he does  he knows he  ll be arrested  br    br   boyer  s performance was good  and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar  he captures the essence of such a character   a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time  the movie itself  unfortunately  was quite a letdown  a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent  of which i  ll mention two  first was the idea that the police wouldn  t enter the casbah  that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander  and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly  so  neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn  t enter  nor the statement by inspector slimane  also a decent performance by joseph calleia  that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense  i also found it difficult to believe that le moko   hardened criminal mastermind that he was   could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby  hedy lamarr  to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her  essentially giving himself up  i understand the irony of the final few scenes  of course  as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison  the casbah  only to find real freedom in his capture  because he  s shot and killed by the police   i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap  br    br   this is worth watching for boyer  and to a lesser extent calleia  but the story is disappointing and inconsistent                man with the screaming brain certainly isn  t a perfect movie  but i  m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell  meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career  slapstick  sarcasm  cheese  action  and happy endings  campbell is  as a writer  uneven  there are lots of things in the story that don  t make a great deal of sense  why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it    and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other  better incarnations  the scene in the restaurant  where yegor and william battle for control of william  s body  is straight out of evil dead ii   there are  however  lots of little touches and non sequiturs that feel rather brilliant  such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue    what are you looking at     the movie looks like a sci fi channel original  probably because it was  the acting is actually pretty good  i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya  she was ruthless and cunning  yes  but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored  ted raimi handled the standard   bumbling assistant   role admirably enough  and bruce is funny as the arrogant  sardonic  condescending american jerk   now that he  s writing his own films  you  d think he  d give himself a role that he hasn  t been typecast in already   man with the screaming brain is a bizarre  nonsensical b movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously           you should never ever even consider to watch this movie  it is absolutely awful  this isn  t an overstatement   it is so unbelievable and exaggerated  it gets boring  it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one  they writer hasn  t been able to pull it off in a good way  br    br   if you  d like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you  but still  you should plug your ears and just watch  it  s not worth listening p there are so many great movies out there  and if i could choose one  this would be the last movie i would pick  but all in all  it  s your choice     br    br   enjoy           tell the truth i   m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people  which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie  and after having seen it  i was really a disappointed  and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie  br    br   i   m surprise at this movie all completely     it is like a kid   s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing  i   m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account  br    br   synopsis  the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior  there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak  br    br   just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all  they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done  the story is very predictable  though expected  and the humor is lame  and haven   t we already seen the same characters  play by mc lovin     in so many other movies  like sasquatch gang    i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep  br    br   well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay  and the acting is so so as expected when you   re watching this type of movie  and the direction  what do one expect  this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer  and that movie also sucks  but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie  br    br   anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time  only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie  can   t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone  br    br   pros  elizabeth bank  two topless scenes  br    br   cons  not funny  dreadful story  nudity and kids do not mix together  br    br   rating          grade  f           this film held my interest enough to watch it several times  the plot has holes  but the lead performers make it work  br    br   catherine mary stewart  julia kerbridge   does a great job as a woman of    who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician  she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school  she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream  br    br   meanwhile  julia  s sister and brother in law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda  arlen aguayo stewart  to avoid having her become a ward of the state  amanda is about   years old from her appearance  amanda is so traumatized from her parent  s murder that she has become mute  needless to say  julia  s    hour days get longer caring for amanda  br    br   rob lowe plays kevin finney  a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda  he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress  amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses  perhaps more than to her aunt  julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination  kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia  br    br   the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great  you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film  the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well  arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words  the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other  you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses  br    br   we discover that julia  s sister and brother in law  the meyers  were involved in industrial espionage  they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer  they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft  julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities  the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed  br    br   in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by   of their former associates  the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them  the killers search the home and fail to find their prize  they leave a living witness to their crime  amanda  the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located  eventually  the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip  s location  br    br   eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin  he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip  after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys  the predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together  br    br   what struck me about the plot were major holes  kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers  how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers  the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene  with no concern for concealing their identity  the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles  he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film  there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention  br    br   the film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming  filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort           like the previous poster  i am from northern vermont  and i was inclined to like this film  however  not since   red zone cuba   have i seen such a confusing plot  the things the people to bootleg make no sense  two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car  uhm  why  then they meet two others  and drive up at night in to the bad guy  s hideout in a luxury packard    wouldn  t just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense  then  parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch  the four fall asleep  when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out  of course they  re spotted and shot at  losing some of their precious cargo in the process  then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border  again  why  i am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area  all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u s  canada border patrol  which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now   br    br   and don  t get me started on the last half hour  which made no sense whatsoever  br    br   the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years          may contain spoilers  this movie was the worst movie ever  i couldn t even watch it all it was so bad  this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot  this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times  not even the gore in the film was good  the shootings were fake and the acting was worse  please do yourself a favor and skip this one  if you see it at the rental store then run the other way  there is nothing good about this film at all  if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head  if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow  i rate this movie a     out of     that s how horrible this film really is  the worst movie ever          watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line  the excellent character development  and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole  br    br   without giving away too much of the plot  it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons  along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves   br    br   the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically  so it isn  t exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u s   br    br   the film is lighthearted  you  ll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags  yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe  all of the film  s characters are taken seriously  as they are  and none are diminished because of their   imperfections    br    br   i  ve been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends  it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance  is this synchronous or what  i think so because now i  m really geeked to give it a try   br    br   watch this wonderful family film  small children might not get it  but teens certainly would  and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again  br    br   why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery  as it is perfect as is           recap  something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica  the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica  julian rome  a former seti worker  is brought in to decipher the message  problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his  and the situation quickly turns awkward  especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him  and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly  soon the object is in the open  the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity  it is decided to open the object  but just before that is done  julian decodes the signal    do not open    but too late  and the object explodes as it is finally breached  and two things unleashed on earth  the first is an alien  that had been dormant in the object  and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff  and washington  that is suspiciously updated on this historic event  decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth  so a russian nuclear submarine  carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica  br    br   comments  the movie holds a few surprises  one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance  and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful  well worked through and a lot better than expected  unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own  and this time not in a good way  actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes  it is never really explained why washington know so much  why washington is able to command russian submarines  why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now  it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english  some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language  and obviously chose english  why    but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus  send their   do not open   message encoded  and finally the end is as open as an end can be  br    br   the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy  from me  must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot  therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good  br    br                 this movie features charlie spradling dancing in a strip club  beyond that  it features a truly bad script with dull  unrealistic dialogue  that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking           had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix  i  d have a couple of hours of my life back  i  m frankly suspicious when i see that a film  s director also wrote it  in this case  according to the credits  the same guy was   writter and director     unfortunately  an indication of the overall quality of this production  there were a few interesting moments  e g   judy tenuta  s scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy ism  which led me to rate this two stars rather than one  those moments  however  were few and far between     and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me  not to mention reprehensible in its violence  i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i  d seen the whole thing  nope  though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later  the   spinning camera   technique was overused and essentially pointless  i found myself talking to the tv screen    what      or   for goodness sake  get on with it    not recommended           the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me  this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard of population is compelling  well documented and enraging  as an american  i am constantly humiliated by my country  s behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement  we suck  this is probably the first john pilger documentary i  ve seen  but it immediately made me want to see what else he  s done  my only complaint  and the reason i gave this film only   out of     is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments  demands that we viewers citizens are complicit in our own inaction   but makes no suggestion of how to help  i don  t know about britain  but america  s made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government  s doings  a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders   cause           this flick is so bad its beyond belief even for an independent low budget film   it just  well  sucks i can  t even believe even troma would put out such crap i have been a fan of some troma flicks for years toxic avenger squeeze play rockabilly vampire to name a few  but lloyd  come on this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste it features some of the worst acting imaginable i think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good   oh wait  that is what they did i mean it these characters have negative charisma with any luck  the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity as will the special effects people but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears the script is full of plot holes the size of alaska  and there are severe continuity problems the worst part however  is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making but  don  t take my word for it go out and waste four bucks renting it just don  t say i didn  t warn you           this is a very memorable spaghetti western  it has a great storyline  interesting characters  and some very good acting  especially from rosalba neri  her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic  she steals every scene she is in  and expresses so much with her face and eyes  even when she  s not speaking  her performance is very believable  she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top  not that there  s anything wrong with being over the top   mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too  br    br   the music score is excellent  and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie  whether you want it to or not  there are a couple of parts that are very amusing  i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot  there  s also lots of slick gun play that  s very well done  br    br   i would probably have given this movie   or   stars if it wasn  t for two things  the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about    minutes into the film  this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie  it is very poorly choreographed  and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight  one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill bud spencer comedy  but this is a more serious western  and the brawl really needed to be more realistic  the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma  s cowardly mexican sidekick  i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something  but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this  and he wasn  t at all funny  all i can say is where is tuco when you need him   br    br   all that having been said  let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned  and all fans of the genre need to see this movie           the plot  michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct  and is looking for his  st big chance  he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star  he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct  the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way  what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy  and  oh yes  there  s romance  and a little sadness too  the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch  the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard  lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in       it must be emphasized that this movie is a story  st  not just a tribute to silent films  later years would bring similar films such as  singin   in the rain         dick van dyke carl reiner  s  the comic        what is special about this film  though  is recreating silent movies in       we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era although some sound effects are included in glorious b w  while the rest of the movie is in pristine color  one of the greatest in the silent era  buster keaton  who at this point was on an uphill climb  is used superbly in   silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game  it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well  but the real reason to watch the movie  if your a motion picture history fan  is that beyond everything else  hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett  s film legacy  it doesn  t take a genius to realize this movie is a   positive   reworking of mack sennett  s and mabel normand  s life  the character michael   linnett   connors is mack sennett  whose real name was michael sinnott  and molly  of course is mabel  sennett had the pie throwings  the bathing beauties and keystone cops  he worked with buster keaton  ben turpin cameo   roscoe   fatty   arbuckle body double  and fell in love with his leading lady  not only all that  but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well  as most film viewers today prefer sound features  those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture  as mack sennett fell into that category  it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade  sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies  his career started in      as an actor  then writer  director   producer  he semi retired in      with about     films to his credit  he had worked with the best  such as charlie chaplin  gloria swanson  bing crosby  w c  fields  keaton  harry langdon  arbuckle  and even roy rogers in way up thar  as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career  mack played it wise   did only selective work for the next    years  in      he had receive an academy award in the short subject category  and another in      for a lifetime of work  in the       s his presence was still felt  e g  here come the co eds      where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in mack  s wandering willies      is done  in       the road to hollywood  used some of sennett  s crosby films    years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated  with his knack of always associating with the right people  a guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk   his radio show came about later in the year       brought a re release of his greatest triumph  tillie  s punctured romance       with sound  in      he was honored on tv  s  this is your life  then his autobiography  the king of comedy        which is a great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade  was published       brought a more concrete association with abbott   costello  as he had a cameo in a c meet the keystone kops  finally in       another tribute with the compilation film  the golden age of comedy  so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer  in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table  as we get to the silver haired mack  he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say    here i am     when he rises to give a speech a short while later  he is at his most subdued  underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey    i know my influence on comedy will never end  but will people forget mack sennett the individual  maybe this movie will help             it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men  after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage  and any woman who got involved with adam  hoss  and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldn  t get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western  br    br   perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights  people have relationships  some go good  some not so good  it  s just life  and we  re less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don  t have to kill the character off to keep the survivor  s nobility intact  but that  s if bonanza were done today  br    br   but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped  the secret of bonanza  s success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons  ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name  his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children  the kids were all different in personality  but all came together in a pinch  br    br   the cartwrights became and still are an american institution  i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys  just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that   br    br   pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show  rumor has it he didn  t care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious  perhaps if it were done now  he  d have liked it better in the way i describe  br    br   this was just the beginning for michael landon  how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit  landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control  little joe was the youngest  most hot headed  but the most romantic of the cartwrights   br    br   when roberts left  the show kept going with the two younger sons  but when big dan blocker left  the heart went out of bonanza  other characters had been added on by that time  david canary  tim matheson  and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel  but big  loyal  but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights  his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family  br    br   so the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history  i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city  it doesn  t look anything like what you see in bonanza  but near lake tahoe  just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits  is the cartwright home  the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction  like    baker street for sherlock holmes fans  the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are real  br    br   and if they weren  t real  they should have been           years ago  when darling lili played on tv  it was always the pan and scan version  which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format  so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus  i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all  br    br   boy  what a terrible film  it  s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong  looking at it now  it  s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals  mary poppins  sound of music  thoroughly modern millie  etc  but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself  camelot  my fair lady  etc  because hollywood thought she wasn  t sexy or glamorous enough  so blake created this stillborn effort  to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical  darling lili suffers from multiple personalities  never knowing who or what it is  some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole  it just doesn  t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing  br    br   mind you  the version on the dvd is the   director  s cut    or in this case    let  s salvage whatever we can   from this notorious box office flop  in releasing the dvd  edwards cut    scenes              from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version  the film moves along with no idea of what it is  we are    minutes into it and we still don  t know what  s going on or why we  re watching what  s going  what kind of spy is lili  how powerful is she  was she ever responsible for someone  s death  instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews  things aren  t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love  why does julie fall for hudson  why him and not other men she got involved with  there should have been one of her ex hanging around  trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret  this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action  it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings  there  s no catalyst in this story  br    br   one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews    and edwards    previous successes  the best  or worst  example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest  edwards channeling sound of music  it  s no wonder he removed it from the dvd  back in       that scene might have worked on a certain level but today  that moment reeks of desperation  there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films  the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie  the musical moment   i  ll give you three guesses   was created just to make fun of julie  s mary poppins persona  which is turned   raunchy   with julie doing a striptease in the act  the ending  bird  s eye view of julie running towards hudson  s plane  is another   wink   at sound of music  br    br   the whole thing is confusing  julie plays a singer  born from a german father and british mother  who lives in england but sings her  english  songs in paris  you never know exactly where the story takes place  some moments are just badly edited  like when julie and her   uncle   are on horseback  they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence  i  m like   what happened here    br    br   the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy  every scene with the french police are pathetic  where  s peter sellers when you really need him  the action is stupid beyond belief  when julie and her   uncle   are on their way to germany on that train  hudson  s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train  almost killing lili in the process  brilliant  what  s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning  that  s one slow moving train there   br    br   the musical moments  the beginning is the best part of the entire film  and the reason i gave this film   stars  but it  s effect is diminished considerably because it  s repeated at the end  speaking of redundant  did we really need to see a can can dance  crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too  the   girl in no man  s land   is ok even if it  s bleeding obvious  but that moment just doesn  t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital  making me wonder  how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying  br    br   the whole project is listless and without energy  the romance is      unbelievable  rock hudson is way too old and tired looking  check out the museum scene   julie looks dazed  like she  s on valium  but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy  edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision  as much as i like julie  she  s no greta garbo  who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari  funny enough  even if julie plays a german spy  she still comes across as cloying and cute  br    br   how bad is darling lili  even after    years since its release  blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release           this series  made for televisi  n espa  ola  tve  is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in       primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son  br    br   based on a background of historical events  such as the may      student uprising in france  the decaying franco regime  the war in viet nam  the rise of imperialism  and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment  one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment  br    br   generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic  the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times  as  it should be stated  anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things  br    br   the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato  s r  le as mother of three children  she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well  manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant  especially noticeable among women  of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart  without any resorting to the use of the brain  as we say in spain  common sense is one of the least common senses  imanol arias offers very little  apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series  indeed  as an actor  he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series  his resources are too limited  however  his part as father of the working class household is not at all bad  br    br   not really recommendable for other audiences  even spanish speakers in latin america  the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history  such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references  it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers           i want the    minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie  the acting was horrific  i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d  onofrio  i will never look at them the same again  keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise  everyone knows they never could act  thankfully  only dan attempted an accent  his accent was a disaster as expected  i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota  i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time  the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read           one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers  an observation which mystifies me  not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee it had many young actors who were to become major stars  e g   tobey maguire  before spiderman   skeet ulrich  before jericho   jonathan rhys meyers  before tudors   james caviezel  simon baker  mark ruffalo  jeffrey wright  tom wilkinson  and jewel  all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances  especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing  br    br   when the biographies and accomplishments of the director   even when he won an academy award  and the actors are listed  this film is usually omitted from their past performances  i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films  however  it is seldom every seen on cable  i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known           it  s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead  this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clich   you cant help but like it  br    br   i think the story was a little rushed at the end  but extending that would have made the story even longer  superior to other romantic comedies such as     days with mr arrogant  and possibly tied with my tutor friend  br    br   it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema  not as great as my sassy girl  but still good           of all the movies of the seventies  none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel  i mean  yes  there were movies like the exorcist  and other ones  but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one  if you have time  check this one out  you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such  but this is a story worth getting into then there are all the stars and soon to be stars  my absolute favorites were eli wallach  sylvia miles  and burgess meredith  then there are the subtle clues that lead to what  s going on too  pay close attention  i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like   black and white cat  black and white cake    plus  the books are really good as well  i  m just sorry that they  re not going to turn the second book into a film  it  s so scary that it would outdo this movie           this is apparently the second remake of this film  having been filmed before in      and       and  in so many ways it reminds me of the later film  a yank at oxford  both films concern a conceited blow hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both  ultimately  show the blow hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency  in this film  william haines is   tom brown   and his main rival    bob   is played by frances x  bushman  and  in a supporting role is jack pickford  always remembered as the brother of mary  of these three  pickford comes off the best  as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom  s pal  he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game  all the standard clich  s are there and the movie  because it was done so many times before and since  offers few surprises  however  it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing  br    br   in my opinion  for a better silent college film  try harold lloyd  s the freshman  it  s football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown  the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era  another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again  such as in westpoint and the smart set  among others   and if you  ve seen one of these films  you  ve seen them all  well made  but certainly not original  and  because it is just a rehash of his other films  anyone giving the film a score of    is strongly advised to see these other films  br    br            i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the        talk about over rated  there are dozens and dozens of better films  how this film got to be    is anyone  s guess           this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that  s holding it back  br    br   awesome talent  outstanding performances  particularly by victoria hill   but a let down in practically every other way  br    br   an   adaptation   of sorts  it brought nothing new to macbeth  no  setting it in present day australia is not enough   and essentially  completely failed to justify its existence  apart from  let  s face it  completely unnecessarily  paying homage to the original work  if there  s one body of work that has been done  and done and done and done   it  s shakespeare  s  so any adaptation  if it  s not to be a self indulgent and pointless exercise  needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work  br    br   and that  s what this macbeth fails to do  as it was done  this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever  it  s the same piece that we have seen countless  too many   times before  except with guns and in different outfits  br    br   apart from the fundamental blunder  no other way to put it  of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue  one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end  during which i completely tuned out  even though i was looking at the screen  i never thought i had a short attention span  but there you go  br    br   i suppose the movie succeeds on its own  very limited terms  but as australia continues to produce world class acting talent  its movie makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms  and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with  br    br   a shame  an absolute shame           owen loves his mamma   only he  d love her better six feet under in this dark  laugh out loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito  with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role  br    br     throw momma from the train   is a terrific comedy  even if it isn  t a great film  it  s too shallow in parts  and the ending feels less organic than tacked on  but it  s a gut splitting ride most of the way  with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer  devito is avid but untalented  crystal is blocked and bitter   br    br   crystal  s professor donner believes his ex wife stole his book  the unfortunately titled   hot fire    and can  t write more than the opening line of his next book  which doesn  t come easy  he teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities  including a middle aged woman who writes tom clancy type fiction but doesn  t know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through  and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life  mr  pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs per minutes on screen  an ascot wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus        girls i  d like to pork    br    br   then there  s devito  s owen lift  who calls himself professor donner  s   star pupil   even though the teacher won  t read his work in class  owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie  a man child in his late   s who lives with his overbearing mother  anne ramsey  who calls him   lardass   and other endearing sentiments  in any other movie  we  d be asked to feel sorry for owen  but   throw momma from the train   piles life  s cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along  that  s one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people  br    br   for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character  even identifying with him  and take the rest of what we see here as a lark  it  s not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes  asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donner  s help in a plan to kill his mother  actually  he first goes to hawaii to kill donner  s hated ex  then tells the professor it  s his turn to kill mrs  lift    swapping murders   as seen in hitchcock  s   strangers on a train    br    br   as a director  devito not only complements his actors   performances with scene setting that places the accent on dialogue  he makes some bold visual statements  throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes  and away from taking things too seriously   br    br   also helping matters is writer stu silver  who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter    you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here      she  s not a woman   she  s the terminator      one little murder and i  m jack the ripper    those are all crystal  s words  but some of the funniest lines  which work only in context but absolutely kill  are devito  s and ramsey  s  apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this  according to the imdb  and that  s a shame  because he had real talent for it  br    br   the best scene in this movie  when crystal meets ramsey  was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical   coming attraction   presentation  the only time i  ve seen a movie promoted that way  owen introduces the professor to his mother as   cousin patty    and when momma says he doesn  t have a cousin patty  panicky owen loses it    you lied to me    he yells out  slamming the professor  s forehead with a pan  br    br   of course  in reality the professor wouldn  t groan out something witty from the floor  but   throw momma from the train   works effectively at such moments  when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth  devito hasn  t disappeared from films  of course  but it  s a mystery why he hasn  t really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie  maybe it  s because  as   throw momma from the train  s lack of mainstream success shows  his kind of vision isn  t to everyone  s tastes  that  s too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over  and like it           a compelling thriller       december      author littlehammer      from united states br    br   just cause br    br   starring sean connery laurence

divulges to armstrong the truth of joanie shriver  s heinous murder and why he was brought here it turns out that bobby earl is a psychopathic murderer and he really did rape and kill joanie shriver

going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves  br    br   this film is set in glasgow  although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent   the premise  about people who  s lives are going nowhere  who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs  could have made for a really funny  insightful  quirky

z as well  oh you figure it out  br    br   a total waste of time  painful dialogue   it sounded like something that a group of    year olds would have written for a gcse drama project  the female character was completely superfluous   just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it  br    br   if you  re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts

worthwhile  it really reminds me of the old serials from the   s and   s  which is why i  d have loved to see follow up movies    but judging by the rest of full moon  s output there simply weren  t enough tits to satisfy the typical audience  unfortunately  thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience   which is unfortunate  because without em

a truly muddled incomprehensible mess  most things in the film look more or less like       but then there are futuristic things just thrown in  like the policeman  s ray gun  and that car  the

by the still slinky julia roberts  hey  why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this  by all accounts ms  roberts looks good and holds her own  but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character  maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know    but we as an audience never do  as for the third member of the   team    philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos  a smart  street  wise  i e  non ivy league graduate  cia malcontent who knows the score    both in the agency  s boardroom and in wilson  s bedroom  br    br   for the mujahideen to succeed  the most important assistance the u s  can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi    helicopter gunships which rule the skies  this takes money  lots of money  and eventually   charlie  s team   covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of    billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels  this includes top of the line  state of the art anti aircraft and anti tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices  nasty  nasty stuff  br    br   that this kind of multi billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming  every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business as usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government  oh momma  i wish it weren  t so    br    br   even though the initial outcome for   team charlie   was an unqualified success  the unimaginable  unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others  since the funding was entirely   covert    the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention  yes  once the russkies left  so did our aid    zip for schools  zip for infrastructure  zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people  as a result  the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster    it  s like the forerunner to   mission accomplished    br    br   as nichol  s film so pointedly points out    the ball you  ve set in motion can keep bouncing even after you  ve lost interest in it    mike krzyzewski knows this  eva longoria parker knows this  little lateesha in lafayette knows this  but the typical american politician doesn  t  so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn  t let the world know we were the good guys  talk about a catch     another mike nichols film   br    br   perhaps charlie wilson said it best    we f  ked up the end game    br    br   again           i  m a big fan of surrealist art  but this film by bunuel  with some ideas from dali  left me cold  bunuel had a life long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways  this is one of the silliest  almost like what you  d expect from a smart aleck    year old in film class  the last few minutes of the movie  which have nothing to do with anything else  are a final nose thumbing at religion  br    br   if you read the   scholars   regarding this slow paced  occasionally amusing film  it  s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression  if that is indeed the point  then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible  the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street  and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies  is this behavior the church  s fault  for interrupting his lovemaking   or is he just a jerk  i vote for the latter  i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame  br    br   there are a few moments where you might cry    aha  surrealism     a cow in a bed  a giraffe falling out a window  a poor model   a man shredding a feather pillow  a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava  or a mud pit   hard to tell in b w   the rest is forgettable self indulgence  unfortunately  bunuel was still chasing the same bogey men through the rest of his career  viridiana  discreet charm      if you  re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen  check out jean cocteau  s early work           this ludicrous film offers the standard       s   hippie mentality   in a nut shell and bores us in the process  its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young  innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups  a naive young hippy played by the waif like   kay lenz   hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys  and then one day she meets the ridiculous  holden   already in old age  hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor  and she decides that she is in   love   with him  if you think that is superficial  the whole film encapsulates such scenes  she keeps saying how much she   loves   him and she only met him  it wears thin and really quick  i couldn  t help but laugh throughout the film  its obvious she  s just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place  a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex  i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit  a corny offering of music from the     s is also spread through the film  avoid this if you can  grade d           this film was pretty good  i am not too big a fan of baseball  but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love  determination  heart  etc  br    br   danny glover  joseph gordon levitt  brenda fricker  christopher lloyd  tony danza  and milton davis jr  are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport  the plot was believable  and i love the message  william dear and the guys put together a great movie  br    br   most sports films revolve around true stories or events  and they often do not work well  but this film hits a    on the perfectness scale  even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there  br    br                 for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments  in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film  the ending is superb  the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it s ending wasn t an end but a beginning of the end  a great movie and only a piece of japan s great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind         this film contain far too much meaningless violence  too much shooting and blood  the acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor  the only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars          pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion philosophy  the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong  br    br   examples  quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion  how  well  in the world of the subatomic  you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time  you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time  also  the act of observation seems to affect the event  solid particles can pass through barriers  all of this  so far  is accurate  but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall  you could indeed do it  this is complete poppycock  instead  the theory asserts that at our level  it is possible for you to walk through a wall  but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief  also you  d have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall  the odds are so astronomically against it  br    br   this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science  but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer  played by marlee maitlan  about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible  something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self hate  there may be some truth to that  but quantum physics has nothing to do with it  br    br   plus  string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays  instead of wasting your time with this dreck  i suggest you rent the elegant universe  an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only   hour long episodes  quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation           i was truly looking forward to this title  it sounded and looked fun  the idea of someone making a cheesy   s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs  but instead this title only bores  first off  there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment  i have to sit through     minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the froggg humping a bare breasted chick  why  on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot  i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads  i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp  i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue  creature from the black lagoon stuff   i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on a killing spree  or it maybe escaping a silly trap  something exciting  geez  have fun with it  be creative  who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick  my advice to the filmmakers  keep going  your concepts are good  but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired  have some fun with the creature  put the humor in the action and most important   put more creature in a creature movie             one of my sisters friends lent me this game  and it is too damn hard  it carries the appearance of a kids game  but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions  and you have to search seemingly endless levels for     notes  to improve your   score    you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces  that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them  and i am only up to stage three      maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this  but otherwise keep away  and it is definately not recommended for kids   they will pull their hair out within the hour           chuck jones  s   rabbit seasoning    the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy  is often considered to be the best of the three  while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons  i would have to concede that   rabbit seasoning   is the most finely honed script  here  the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello  s   who  s on next   routine  as a long term daffy fan  i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines  the famous   pronoun trouble   being one of the all time classics  and does most of the work  bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer  as always  is the befuddled dupe  part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs  elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst  being shot in the face again and again  his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions  it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration   you  re despicable    as intricate an example of chuck jones  s impeccable timing as you  ll come across    rabbit seasoning   is a true classic           a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches     people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear  also  alas  an ending that comes out of nowhere  because  apparently  the auteur has lost interest in the movie  or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot             crossfire   is a justifiably famous      noir that  s a murder mystery with a strong message  it stars robert young  robert mitchum  robert ryan  sam levene  and gloria grahame  and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk  we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning  and for the rest of the film  young  as the detective  finlay  in charge of the case  seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death  and just as important  why  the victim  joseph samuels  sam levene  is someone the soldiers meet in a bar  they go up to his apartment to continue their visit  and samuels winds up dead  br    br   i don  t know about       but seeing   crossfire   today  one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects  i don  t suppose it was so apparent back then  as these actors were just getting started  nevertheless  the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting  good direction  violence  and unsparing anti semite language  br    br   the characterizations are vivid  including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role   she  s a woman who meets mitchell  george cooper   one of the suspect soldiers  in a bar and can provide him with an alibi  the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan  but everyone is excellent  robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective  mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell  a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife  br    br   truly excellent  and a must see           awwww  i just love this movie to bits  me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan    i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon  come to mention it  i have not see the tv show in a long time  such geart times  where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don  t know what there missing  br    br   the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys girls of rock n  roll  diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother  br    br   this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today       out of     such an excellent movie           skippy from   family ties   plays eddie  a wussy   metal   nerd who gets picked on  when his favorite wussy   metal   singer  sammi curr  dies  he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall  but when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead   metal   idol  he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge  but then he doesn  t want to take it as far as sammi does  which isn  t really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital  this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say    rock star    ok  maybe a tad more than that piece of junk  but you get my point  and how anyone can root for a guy played by skippy from   family ties   i haven  t a clue  the cameo by gene simmons is ok  and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency  i applaud him for that  but otherwise skip this one  br    br   my grade  d  br    br   eye candy elise richards gets topless  an a topless extra at a pool party          of course i would have to give this film    out of    as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime  rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over    years living in italy  he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing  so rodolfo sonego did  if you check out his biography  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy  alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories  my uncle visited australia and my town  in      to check out locations for   a girl in australia   and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war  you can see his humor in all his movies  i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently  great          goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history  their is no doubt about that  but this game  although quite different  could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ  of its time  br    br   this was not a bond game based on material from another medium  this was a completely new  scripted game  which even had its own theme song   wouldnt be bond without it  haha   gameplay was excellent  and if you  re a fan of the bond games or films alike  you  ll enjoy it  br    br   unlike some most games  these cast members portrayed their characters themselves  as opposed to fictional creations for the game  which gives it that more cinematic feel  with a very   bond   able storyline  you feel like you  re in the game as much as you get lost in a movie  br    br   enjoyable in all aspects  from start to finish  even after beating the game there  s still plenty more to be done  with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved  as well as its multi player missions  this is a stand out game  despite being quite old now  in video game years  it  s still a good game that you can pick up   play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life  even now just thinking about it  i  ve got the theme song stuck in my head  such a great cast and well written storyline  br    br   the story comes to life on the screen  almost as if the actors were their in front of you  and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself  superbly done  in true bond fashion  which can only be named awesome  completely awesome  br    br   i  ve gotta go throw this game on now  if you haven  t played it yet  you  re missing out          helena bonham carter is the center of this movie  she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity  kenneth branagh was tolerable  the movie itself was good not exceptional  if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing          i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a   thumbs in the middle   review  remarking that i  d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode  i  ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june       and as a lifelong batman fanatic  i can say without hesitation  this show is utter crap  br    br   everything  s wrong with it  everything  getting past just the lousy animation and design  the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories  br    br   and for god  s sake   is it just me  or is the joker in every episode   is gotham that much of a revolving door justice system  or  again  is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains  see   no character development    above   br    br   and to make matters worse  every single joker tale is the same   part formula  br    br      joker gasses people  br    br      joker sets out to gas the whole city  br    br      batman saves the day  br    br   pfeh  br    br   there was one episode i saw that wasn  t a joker story  the title escapes me  but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster   the   think thank thunk   episode with the quiz show  that was the single worst batman story i  ve ever seen  heard or read  yes  worse than   i  ve got batman in my basement     br    br   i can  t really say what i feel this show is because it  s probably against the tos  but it starts with   b   and rhymes with   fastardization    thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc  era of bat entertainment  back from the fox and kids wb days  stuff that good  and i should have known this  just couldn  t possibly have lasted forever  unfortunately           just because someone is under the age of    does not mean they are stupid  if your child likes this film you  d better have him her tested  i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad  this   film   is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else  the writing is horrid  i can  t remember when i  ve heard such bad dialogue  the songs are beyond wretched  the acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much  who decided to employ joey fatone  he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin  br    br   the worst thing is the obviousness of it all  it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible  great children  s movies are wicked  smart and full of wit   films like shrek and toy story in recent years  willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past  but in the continual dumbing down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo  yes  that  s right   the recent charlie   the chocolate factory and eye crossing trash like red riding hood             hey babu riba   is a film about a young woman  mariana  nicknamed   esther   after a famous american movie star   and four young men  glenn  sacha  kicha  and pop  all perhaps       years old in      belgrade  yugoslavia  the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz  blue jeans  or anything american it seems  br    br   the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant  and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties  in the wake of changing communist politics  they go their separate ways and reunite in       the year before the film was made   br    br   i enjoyed the film with some reservations  the subtitles for one thing were difficult  especially in the beginning  there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all  perhaps the conversational pace required it  but i couldn  t always both read the text and absorb the scene  which caused me to not always understand which character was involved  i watched the movie  a video from our public library  with a friend  and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative  br    br   this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers   sense of invulnerability  idealism  and strong and loyal bonds to each other  there is a main flashforward  and it was intriguing  keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis a vis the      cast  and what had actually happened  br    br   i would rate it   out of     and would like to see other films by the director  jovan acin                       after a snowstorm  the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman jason  adam beach  comes to the diner of his friend fritz  jurgen prochnow  and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day  among the weird strangers  jason meets his former sweetheart nancy  rose mcgowan   who has just left her husband in los angeles  along the night  without any communication with his base  jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients  and finds some corpses  indicating that among them there is a killer  br    br     the last stop   could be an average thriller  but the screenplay is simply awful  most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed  and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests  my vote is four  br    br   title  brazil     encurralados      trapped             this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy  s law being applied to home ownership and construction  if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional  since it was set in the   simpler   forties  we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era  grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas  their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment                 what can you say about the film white fire  amazing  fantastic  disturbing  hilarious  these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire  from wobbly  garbled beginning to profound end  this movie will entertain throughout  br    br   our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world  a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms  when the father separates from the mother and their childen  you get a real sense of what kind of movie you  re about to watch  father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit  and is polite as he gets people  s attention before he shoots them  but alas  dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised  unsafe stunt  meanwhile  mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about   feet behind them  he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre   halt     and then promptly wastes the mother  this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred  br    br   so now we fast forward about    years     if you  re honest about the hero  s age  to beautiful turkey  where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves  or diamond prospectors  or something  ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods  while bo  masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty  drives around the desert in his denim outfits  bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship  they don  t seem to have any friends other than each other  and they spend all of their time together  that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as   you know its a shame you  re my sister   he says to her while she  s stark naked  make for a very dynamic duo  bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed  as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf  a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid  and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid  this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong  bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas  and he is overjoyed with his new love  br    br   so anyway  there  s a lot of fun action scenes  ridiculous violence  great acting  impossible to follow plot lines  fred   the hammer   williamson  for some reason   and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond  which later explodes   all of these things are great  but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special    really special  so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire  you may be glad you did  or not           i am so disappointed  this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy  here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again  the neurotic upper class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses  woody  i  ve seen these characters already  i  ve seen the storyline from you ten times already  where did your creativity go    you need to open your eyes and look around you  the world has changed dramatically since annie hall   and you need to change along with it  br    br   there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism   why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again  br    br   when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out  it does nothing for me   because now i  ve come to expect his old standby  the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating  depressing and same old  same old  br    br   if woody wants to win his fans back  then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated   not insulted           this movie is all ultra lightweight fluff  predictable from beginning to end  as a don knotts vehicle    the incredible mr  limpet   was much better  with knott  s character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant  his performance there was toned down  with none of his trademark goggle eyed stare  although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish  knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile  much as bob denver did  neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles  assuming they were simply typecast  it was probably because of the slouch  the wild stare and the high pitched voice  john ritter  whom knotts worked with in   three  s company    was able to transcend his genre  branching out successfully into dramatic roles like   the dreamer of oz    but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in   pleasantville    even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here  uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in   airplane    and   police squad    br    br   there  s also no way the then    year old knotts could pass for a    year old  as his character insisted he was  it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at    playing the college age forrest gump  br    br   the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget  very much looking like a hastily filmed tv episode  it  s especially evident in the   exterior   scenes of the   town   where roy goes after he  s fired  it  s unlikely even a pre schooler would be fooled by the mayberry like soundstage artificiality  br    br   even viewing this strictly as a children  s movie  it  s very disappointing  it  s not because it lacks action or special effects  although it does  the pace is much too slow  the situations repetitive  how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus  a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap  with breakneck gags  otherwise you risk boring them  and any adults in the theater as well   movies  even kid  s movies  have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades  even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written  disney  s   the love bug    for instance  at least had some interesting race action           if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization  there is an excellent book called   outlaw seas   or   the outlaw sea    and it describes  in story after story  how these things do happen  the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons  one  many of the world  s freighters are of questionable registry  nationality  and it  s difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don  t have an office in a real country  two  many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries  the crews are often  like illegal immigrant workers  threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices  three  there is often a language barrier  not only between the officers and the crew  but also between the crew members themselves  the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence  four  once committing an illegal act  the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint  anyway  it  s fascinating reading  br    br   horrifying story  excellent movie  does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies  hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year  so that several of the top   contenders usually come from britain  jerry bruckheimer   the end of quality cinema  br    br   i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee  i also  as usual  loved omar epps           gamers  dr is not a fancy made movie  it  s more like amateur video  horrible magic effect  really fake fireball  terribly made dungeon  castle  village       sword  axe  shield  robe  plate      okok    everything  you will need about    minutes to adjust your expecting on visual  then you will get     minutes of fun  br    br   i  m from hongkong and it  s really hard to find rpers  none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d d  watching gamers  dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer  you see rule books  dices  game set  etc etc etc  you hear terms like   fighter      wizard      hit point      level      character      flaming hand      chaotic evil    br    br   what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to  not bonded by software rpg  gamers  dr provide the same element  you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead  the movie goes both gamers  s real life as well as in the d d world  you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action  which make you feel you really participle in the game  br    br   i don  t want to spoil anything  but in short  gamers  dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers  for people never play rpg game  i  m sure you still get many fun from it           in all honesty  i haven  t seen this film for many years  but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory  as anyone who has seen it will understand  i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties  and it scared the hell out of us kids  in a fun way  i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze  i can  t risk giving away the ending  except to say that it was surprising  to say the least  i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler  followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed  the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history  and yet oddly moving  in a way  you have to see it for yourself  which is not easy these days  i don  t know if it  s available on home video or not  but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults           this is the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year      and say now that rocked  it rocked hard  and yet it also rocked tasty  mr meatloaf added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled  now that tells you something  this filmed rocked even before it started  now i don  t want to give to much away or be a   spoiler   but this movie rocked  if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself   this seems a bit substandard tenacious material it is like i a merely playing badminton with satan  what gives    then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece  for those who would want it better do not know what they want because better would no longer be the d  this movie is the d period  so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked           you  d think you  re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel      miles or so from france to saudi arabia  going through most of europe   italy  bulgaria  croatia  slovenia  turkey  before arriving in the middle east  but this is not a tour  and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights  br    br   reda  s father is in his twilight years  and wishes to do the haj  however  since walking and taking the mule is out of the question  he chooses to travel to mecca by car  he can  t drive  and therefore enlists the help of reda  to his son  s protest  to get him there in their broken down vehicle  br    br   but reda doesn  t see the point of having him go along  when his dad could opt for the plane  he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn  t understand  and hence  we set off in this arduous journey with father and son  being not the best of pals  br    br   the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair  the challenges they face  the weird people they meet  having to duke it out in varied weather conditions  and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car  we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other  the father trying to impose on his son  and the son trying to assert himself as an adult  but circumstances we see  reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water  through the many encounters  they actually team up quite well despite their differences  br    br   it  s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji  and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj  the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold  and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating  the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon  so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination  br    br   it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are  don  t miss this  and yes  book early   i was pleasantly surprised that this evening  s session was still a full house           i watched this movie based on the good reviews here  and i won  t make that mistake again  br    br   the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy  but you don  t see what it is  flashback    hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people  which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen  when the ending is finally reveled  you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn  t happen and means nothing to what you have been watching  the only connection these people have is that they have all had a   bad day    but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom  br    br   if this was supposed to be a   crash   clone  it  s a complete failure           a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store  after he  s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he  ll be transferring soon  bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy   and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals  animals like say  a certain rabbit  this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer  i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early       s  it still remains as funny nearly     years later  this animated short can be seen on disc   of the looney tunes golden collection volume    br    br   my grade  a           i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in      for two reasons   br    br       host steve martin was at his most wittiest     i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo    and    i  ll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle  s head in my bed     br    br       surprise winners  no one had adrien brody down for best actor   genuine applause   or roman polanski for best director   genuine jeers and boos   but they won  br    br   last year  s award ceremony wasn  t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn  t the best in the trilogy   fellowship was much better  but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but   so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links   but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne   oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics   obviously they are   i  m sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers  br    br   chris rock wasn  t too bad   but he  s no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in   not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion   the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the    minor    oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats   there  s no such thing as a    minor    oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they  re as well deserved as best picture or best director   all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium   what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn  t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history   as for the awards themselves  br    br   best supporting actress   cate blanchett   no great surprise for a competitive category  br    br   best supporting actor   morgan freeman   no real complaints since freeman is one of america  s greatest living character actors  br    br   best actor   jamie foxx   most predictable award of the night   yawn  br    br   best actress   hilary swank   major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night  br    br   best director   clint eastwood   major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he  d never won one   actually i  m glad about this because if he didn  t deserve it for taxi driver   raging bull or goodfellas he didn  t deserve it for the aviator  br    br   best film   million dollar baby   again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb  s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off  br    br   what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven  t done in the past   i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd  s sake   and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts          while in a plane  flicking through the large choice of movies  i came across live  almost accidentally  oh boy  what a choice  br    br   i remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show  now i can easily say this has been a hell of a ride  i don  t remember last time i have been so excited  terrified  not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses  but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can  t turn away from the screen  literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you  ve got  br    br   you will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show  you will drift from thinking   how come the human being can be so vicious   to   why not after all    ask yourself would you do it  then learn about the contestants  their motives and start guessing  you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe  br    br   good acting  good directing  with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more  br    br    spoilers  couple of things i would have changed  br    br     the casting of the contestants  i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him  the idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid  it felt like you didn  t care about some of the contestants  although this might have been done on purpose  i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants    game rules  a big glitch   br    br   what happens if the  th contestants doesn  t die when he pulls the trigger  do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself    they should have given a chance to all contestants to live  ie  if  th is a blank too  then no one dies  br    br   interestingly i haven  t been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time  just wish i had some popcorn with me           ah  another movie with motorcycles  hell  s angels posse and steve a lame o as the not so cool car driver  this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking  pot smoking  and lots of moronic acts  steve  s rendition of a dying cat during his   i love what i know   serenade had me vomiting for hours  bike chick linda  rrrr  makes out with everyone  fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds  i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying    you messin   wit private stock    this is scriptwriting folks  br    br   i liked the ending  what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse  you have to see this to detest it  br    br   die jeter  die             a rating of       does not begin to express how dull  depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is           i feel dumber after watching the first    min luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain  people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly not because of the budget of the film or the special effects  just simply good acting and getting simple things right and most importantly  not being lame    but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is     a good movie    don  t be scared of rating films low save your under appreciated high scores for     once in a life time movies      keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions don  t spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace   love          the most self indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to br    br   rent  unwatchable  much of the movie is obviously improvised  br    br   and not well  it looks like toback took the first take of br    br   everything  the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when br    br   robert downey jr  shows up  then goes to hell again real br    br   quickly           this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in  this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny  i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny  he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual  but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny  he isn  t  the movie had only one good part  and this may be considered a spoiler by some  and that the beginning credits were animated  if the whole movie had been animated  it might have been good  i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it  and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest  this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on  on a scale of      i give this movie a score of                i like ghost stories  good ghost stories of bumps in the night  voices that cannot be explained  now i  ve see many of them  as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films  some times to find a real gem   you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories  now this one  very rare   pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called    the new house    was one of the most scariest films i ever saw  it was on once in         i was only     but nothing since then even compared to it  with all the remake going on in hollywood  some one should do this one    as is    with no more special efx than the original  this episode was down right creepy as hell  i  m lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find  the only other   ghost stories to even come close was the original    the haunting    and george c  scott in    the changling      wish someone would do more ghost stories like these           okay  i  ve watched this movie twice now  i have researched it heavily on the net  i have asked several people on there opinions  i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic   carmilla    a book that this movie is supposed to be based on  i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it  as the plot of the movie doesn  t seem to make any sense at all  here is the plot of the book  br    br   laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father  mr de lafontaine  they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully  one day they get a letter from the   general   a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death  he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work  and explains that he will visit them soon  meanwhile  a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter  carmilla  for several months  soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams  and begins to come down with a strange illness  who is this mysterious carmilla  and just what has she to do with laura  s condition  and the general  br    br   i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it  and let me know what their results are  i even have a catchy name  and would have a jingle too  but i can  t be bothered with that  it  s called the   this movie doesn  t make any sense   game  br    br   all you have to do is  whilst watching the movie  try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening  i mean complete  all questions answered  everything makes sense  absolutely complete  br    br   it will have to answer such questions as      br    br     why can vampires walk around in day light  br    br     why are they all lesbians  br    br     why is a girl called bob  and why does she shoot herself  br    br     when is the movie a dream and when is it real  br    br     why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn  t make anyone bat an eyelid  br    br     why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car  yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car  accept the excuse that she is a zombie too  br    br     and why does he then let a girl  which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire  drive with him in his car  br    br     and then let her drive off  alone with his daughter in a stolen car  br    br   what the hell is the asylum scene all about  br    br     what the hell is the green goo all about  br    br     why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse  br    br     why are there never any vampires fighting zombies  br    br     what is the significance of the necklace  what is it made of  why does it kill vampires  and how does jenna know that  br    br   in fact sod it  it  s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too  br    br   i have my plot  and i have to admit it is not quite there  but it is a pretty good effort  br    br   in conclusion br    br     vampires vs zombies   has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies  everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on  yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this  and somehow it is based on a classic   th century horror novel  how  why  what the hell is going on           this would  ve been a  great  silent film  the acting really is good  at least in a look ma  i  m doing really big acting  sort of way  br    br   everything is huge  every line is profound  every scene is shattered by human tragedy  br    br   mostly  i felt like gagging  yet  like any train wreck  i couldn  t tear my eyes away  this dialogue might  ve worked on the stage  although i doubt it  on the screen  it was cluttered  haphazard  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work  br    br   if you enjoy your melodrama in huge  heaping doses  you  might  enjoy the movie  be prepared to wait  however  for all that melodrama  this thing sure plods along at its own pace  br    br   this script must  ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves  it simply doesn  t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera  br    br   imdb does us a great disservice  at times  when it uses its goofy computer controlled   weighted score    curse of the starving class deserves less than a    br    br   character driven fiction is great  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution  it isn  t character development  your characters must have a motivation  being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is  not  character development  that  s a plot contrivance  br    br   stay away from this movie  or at the very least  watch it muted  perhaps you  ll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do  br    br   oh  and word to the wise    to prove that this is truly an artsy film  you see james woods in all his dangly male   look at me  i  m the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of  man   glory  br    br   don  t say you weren  t warned           this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward  attended by two orderlies  the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over  saying that the orderlies are gay  the orderlies kiss  i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny    it said   comedy   on the dvd case  after all and it goes on like that  had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter  because it is so funny    and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy  while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn  t  this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn  t  br    br   brilliant brains can make anything funny  people like ernst lubitsch  billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact  but you have to know the   mechanics    i suppose  director and co scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics  he thinks that certain things simply are funny  the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma  for example  do not get me wrong  some people can make that funny  dani levy can  t  not for me  anyway  br    br   the main problem i have with this movie is that i can  t see a reason behind the way the main characters behave  i could not understand why the two brothers  one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other  they are both rather bland characters  their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other  well  one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin   but even these incestuous relationships    if anything they are embarrassing   just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better  br    br   the acting is not bad  udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl  a lighter version  than of a venerable orthodox jew  the direction in itself is not really bad either  but maybe levy should stick to directing movies  leaving the scriptwriting to someone else  now i heard he did a comedy about hitler  oi  vai           this story about three women is a very sensitive study about  muri  l  charlotte van den eynde  the youngest  laura  els dottermans  who is about    and martha  frieda pittors  the oldest who is the mother of muri  l  they live together in the same building  they have different expectations of life  the vital laura wants a child  muri  l comes from a village and wants to change her life in brussels  martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl  in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something   for instances an accident   which could dramatize this story  as times goes on  you discover that the director doroth  e van den berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more  this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case  so one is left with a feeling of emptiness           first and foremost  i loved the novel by ray bradbury  it  s the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later  it was one of his best books  with  you know  fahrenheit     and dandelion wine  i as just hoping that this movie would be all right  it had lots of chances  with a great cast  like jason robards and jonathn pryce  and bradbury even wrote the script himself  and on top of all that  it has pam grier  br    br   how could it fail  br    br   there may be spoilers within  br    br   first of all  it was dumbed down  much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum  all the visuals from the book   gone  everything that made you squirm   gone  br    br   and then there  s the acting  like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the   s  the kids in this movie cannot act  and  this bugged me a lot  neither of them looked    but   or     their strong friendship wasn  t addressed  it was more like they were acquaintaces   br    br   you  d think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr  halloway and mr  dark  but here it  s like they just don  t care  all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something  this is far from being some of their best performances   br    br   pam grier was fine as the witch  but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn  t well pulled off  she  s a lot less evil and doesn  t have the presence as she did in the book   br    br   and everything that was left out of the book  the ballon night chase  the marking of jim  s house  the real death of mr  dark  what happened to mr  coogan on the merry go round  the fate of the lightening rod salesman  the real death of the witch  and oh so much more   br    br   and the special effects were bad  even for the   s  the merry go round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn  t really creepy  and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything   br    br   i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel  but it makes blood boil  don  t see this movie but read the book  it  s a classic of bradbury           this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in       i remember him playing in a great film    lost weekend    ray plays the role of michael stuart  who is a very rich banker  there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy  they hire a man to pose as a very rich count  his name is count ariszted   misha auer  who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture  deanna durbin   penny craig  surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard  the entire police department and convicts started applauding  which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film  this is deanna durbin  s first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm           i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas  having reserved a special slot for it last night  i sat down to watch it with my daughter  aged    and a film studies student   with chocolates of course  in eager anticipation  we love jane austin  br    br   after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk  the shaky camera shots and angles  general poor cinematography  direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied  despondent  we viewed on  br    br   anne  played by sally hawkins  looked oddly and with no particular purpose  directly at the camera on several occasions  breaking our hard won   fantasy of the moment   and engaging us directly in an almost   i  ll find you   stalking fashion  br    br   poor rupert penry jones  who played captain wentworth  did his best with the script and direction  bless him  i hope they paid him well  however  as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall  drenching him and his co actor  they were nearly swept out to sea  health and safety would have had a field day  poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line  presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene  anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place  br    br   other than mr  penry jones  alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head  s unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott  br    br   towards the long awaited end of the film  captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie  it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being  in contrast  anne ran  hyper ventilating  from pillar to post in search of the good captain who  in the meantime  had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told  in the course of only three or four minutes  without even having worked up a sweat  br    br   we experienced none of anne  s charms crossing the screen  indeed  we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain  spineless  opinion less anne and why someone  anyone  did not tell mean  winging sir walter to just shut the heck up  br    br   the crucial kiss  normally our favourite girlie moment  was painfully drawn out  as they moved in closer  anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met  eww   br    br   the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been  br    br   what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story  filmed in some of england  s finest scenery  br    br   sorry jane           if you like sci fi  monsters  and ancient legends  then you will love this movie    br    br   the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago  while the acting may have been a little less than desirable  the story line and effects adequately compensated for it  br    br   i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our    inch big screen tv  br    br   if you like non stop action  awesome visuals  and taste for myth and lore    you have to see this movie            a rather silly little film you just may love  br    br   although rather corny and clich   at times  it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun  five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest   just for the sheer joy   knowing yours is the best team    br    br   notable for several screen debuts including david naughton  s first film role after his dr  pepper   be a pepper   commercials and before his major      hit   american werewolf in london    also features paul ruebens in what i believe is his first pee wee herman esquire roll a year before he became known for it  and last but not least  mr  spin city and alex keaton himself  michael j  fox gets his first film role here  fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house  outside of that  no names  but all funny characters  br    br   doubt it has ever made it to dvd  but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late  late show sometime  if you do  is worth your watch  you may hate it  but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love           this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown  i can  t say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy  given the excellent story  the result could have been better though  the movie is pretty long but at the end i was feeling like some things were missing  sound effects and sound tracks were very good  acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak  for people who didn  t read the book  things may look happening too quickly  from my point of view  instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book  they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper  what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican  you see neither of it in the movie  too much rush and using the time not in a good way  these are main problems of the movie  so  it is worth watching but could have been done better           i never fell asleep during a movie  never  this movie did the impossible  br    br   while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts  this movie was a lesson in over abundance  as in  the movie was    minutes too long  it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work  but instead  all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement  the acting was absolutely terrible  bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad lib something called a script  did these people even get any direction  were they coaxed to be boring and dull  either therory wouldn  t surprise me  br    br   what was even worse was the rather unscary make up involved with the creatures from the other side  either way  they all stunk  don  t watch this film  that  s all i can say  unless you  re an insomniac            what can i say  not as bad as many here have made it out to be  the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before  was strictly for ian mcshane  br    br   i was not disappointed in the least  ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role  he  s always great to watch and for my money    an extremely underused actor  br    br   as for the rest of the film     every other actor in the movie delivered strong  solid performances  these people certainly weren  t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation  as this was a fairly low budget film  but this did not mean that any of them   mailed   their appearances in  everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them  br    br   i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul  s performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie  br    br   the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life  not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film  anybody who expected a clear cut  by the numbers  connect the dots   conclusion   or   answer   at the end of the movie    clearly wasn  t watching the film closely enough  this film is not going to tell you what the   meaning of life   is  the idea is that after seeing the film  you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee  i certainly did  br    br   no car chases    no explosions    no bar room brawls      sounds pretty dull  huh   but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it  s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved  br    br          warning          if you  re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous   question   as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly    br    br   you might not enjoy this film           originally harped as a sequel to   the slumber party massacre   series  this film falls flat on it  s face with a new title  first off  if you are going to include the word   massacre   in your film  s title  you better deliver  this one certainly does not  there is no gore  no on screen murders and no chainsaw  as the box art would lead you to believe  instead  we get a paper thin  overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game  only to be offed one by one  again  this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit  why directors  especially those doing direct to video flicks  are afraid to show any gore is beyond me  now  i am not a huge fan of excessive gore  but come on   why else would anyone rent a movie called   cheerleader massacre     besides that problem  the film suffers from a shot on a home video camera cheapness  it looks cheap  sounds cheap  and the actors aren  t all that good  it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be  but even that fails  the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess  folks  if you run across this film  walk away and go find the original   slumber party massacre      out of              a killer  cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder  at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave  this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look  the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem  are back on the case  two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing  thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection  sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish  br    br   the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film  the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out  now i  m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible  if it wasn  t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep  there is a bit of gore but it  s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims  the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times  there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll  the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film  it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line  br    br   the ending is extremely bad  you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does  god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel   br    br                 days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen  in no way  shape  or form would i recommend it to anyone   unless you  re trying to put your kids to sleep or  god forbid  give someone an aneurysm  if i could go back in time and do one thing  i would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters  why  days of heaven  s plot is simple  but extremely vague  long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film  the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with  the climax of the story does not touch you  by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone  the only things working are your eyes  and unfortunately  your ears  who must listen to the sound of linda  the little girl in the story  who talks like a man  i am now dumber for seeing this movie  don  t let it happen to you           in       director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their   silly symphonies   series    the skeleton dance    iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early   s  in disney  s   laugh o gram   cartoon series  however  their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio  that was the birth of celebrity productions  where iwerks continued developing his style and technique  and where he created the character of flip the frog   while his work kept the same high quality  it wasn  t really popular and by      the studio was closed  later that year  iwerks was hired by columbia pictures  and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance  this time in color  br    br         s   skeleton frolics   is essentially  a remake of the      classic   the skeleton dance    the movie that borough him fame and fortune  like that short film  it is set on an abandoned graveyard  where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play  the dead rise from their coffins  ready for the show that  s about to begin  as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra  and begin to play a happy tune  now  it  s not easy to be a musician made of just bones  as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts  however  the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance  a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra  it  s hard to dance with loose body parts  everything ends at dawn  and just when the sun is about to rise again  the skeletons run towards their graves  br    br   directed and animated by ub iwerks himself    skeleton frolics   follows faithfully the pattern set by   the skeleton dance   years before  although with a crucial difference  iwerks did the whole film in technicolor  the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film  and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney  creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before  it is certainly a more experimental film than   the skeleton dance    although sadly  this doesn  t mean it  s necessarily a better film  for starters  the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney  with the only differences being the music  more on that later  and the color effects  it looks beautiful  no doubt about it  but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all  br    br   however  it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film  after all  iwerks executes it in a wonderful way   but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w  stalling for   the skeleton dance    in other words  while denat  s tune is effective and appropriate for the theme  it  s easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling  s song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable  being a musical film  this is of high importance  and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerk  s flawless work of animation  personally  i think that with a better musical accompaniment    skeleton frolics   would be remembered as fondly as   the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking  as it  s still a fun film to watch  br    br   it  s kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success  however  it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer  disney  s main rival   he did not lack the quality of those companies   films  it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney  s mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney  despite its shortcomings    skeleton frolics   is a very funny and visually breathtaking film  that while not exactly the most original and fresh film  one just can  t help but thinking of   the skeleton dance   while watching it   it definitely reminds us that iwerk  s skeletons are still here to haunt us  and inspire us  br    br                 yes  indeed  it could have been a good movie  a love biangle   sorry for the poetical license  but is not a triangle   an interesting story  unfortunately badly told  the image is sometimes weird  sometimes ok  the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted  the sound needs more attention  it usually does in romanian movies   the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen  the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action  about the acting    sorry but the best actress is the landlady  the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer  the acting is poetical when it should be realistic  and realistic when it should be poetical  it  s a picture for adults  told by the children  bother only if extremely curious           you wear only the best italian suits from armani  hand stitched and fitted to your exact measurements  your automobile is the finest that german engineering has to offer  and is equipped with as many gadgets as horses under the hood  you  re a member of the finest polo clubs  frequently dine at restaurants such as spago  and are always accompanied by at least two of the most beautiful women in the world  your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive  while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi automatic     caliber gun  you snow ski in the alps  go

queen  bad boy of the british ss  and perhaps the most desired man in the world  the character of james bond was created by ian fleming  and is the movie industry  s longest lasting icon  being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades  the latest man to play the role is pierce brosnan  who took over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in       and made his     debut in goldeneye  br    br   this is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the nintendo     goldeneye  developed by rare for nintendo  has been on the market for some time  its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is  and no review library would be complete without it  br    br   let  s face it    most of the time movie licensed games are flops  although the two seem like a good mix  the results  for the most part  have been horrendous  games like cliffhanger  true lies  lethal weapon  and not to mention all the star trek flops  are ammunition enough against this mix  and for the record i am not a fan of movie licensed games  especially if i  ve seen the movie  at least that  s how i used to think  in the case of goldeneye  i had more reservations than normal  while not a bad movie  goldeneye the film didn  t have that much appeal to it  and i don  t rank it in the top ten amongst bond movies  as a game  however  let  s just say it  s a completely different story  br    br   the game is a first person shooter  and in order to be successful  you  ll need at least as much brains as brawn  for those who have seen the movie  which i imagine is most of you reading this  the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation  a plot to control the world  s most dangerous satellite  goldeneye  has begun in the ussr  and in the process a beautiful woman has been captured  your missions will be many  the danger extreme  you will have to rely on your wits and experience to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known  m will brief you as soon as you  re ready  good day  james           this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class  their problems  relationships and interactions with each other  it should have managed a wider distribution as it  s much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time  br    br   the swimming instructor is an almost olympian  reduced to teaching adults basic lessons  and often the target of horndogging from his female students  he attempts  more or less  to fend them off  with varying results  br    br   the students characters are mainstream u s a  teachers  policemen  college students and retired people  all of whom haven  t learned to swim for some reason  the movie covers their relationships  including friends  relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class  several subplots provide amusing fodder  including a teacher going through a divorce  some high school students making a documentary  and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys  br    br   this is a good date movie  or just one to watch when you  re in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality           this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  this is the story of a highly trained military man  unhappy with his wife and children  fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman  to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks  predictable  but not a bad watch           i watched six of a kind for w c  fields   he  s only in it for around    minutes and has one long scene  the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville  and several other great moments  the reamaining    minutes are also delightful  thankfully  mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j  pinkham whinney  he is everyone  s foil  he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure  also  his comedy partner  mary boland plays his wife  flora  joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen  boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end  but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture  gracie  s funny  quite  but she can also get tiring  and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time  i don  t remember laughing at him once  although he has one great scene with ruggles  where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while  and one with fields  where he asks fields to sell him a sweater  that bit is exclusively fields    though   the situation is constantly funny  the whinneys are going to drive to california  but to help them with expenses  george and gracie are recruited                 edmund lowe  who reminds me somewhat of warren william   heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour  br    br   douglas walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise  hypnotism  anyone    and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast  everyone from virginia bruce  kent smith  frieda inescourt  gene lockhart  jessie ralph  benita hume  rosalind ivan and h b  warner  as an added bonus  there  s nat pendleton as a dimwit detective  and furthermore  get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home  must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film  br    br   on the plus side  the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled  it  s all suddenly clear to detective philo vance  and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense  br    br   nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner           this movie is lame and not funny at all  the plot doesn  t even make sense  some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension  maybe hell     and his daughter gets sucked through it or something  then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit  i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her   the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she  s more interested in her new girlfriend  and they stumble upon this witch spell book  they want to be witches or something     and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently  there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary  obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie  i  m sure the topless girls doesn  t hurt there either  the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie  i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing  who are these people and what are they doing  basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things  like the other dimension and book seller  than make it confusing  i didn  t like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal  i don  t recommend watching it though it was just too stupid  i can  t think of any part of the movie that was good           although i was hoping that i  d like it a little more  this was still certainly an impressive film  there were great performances by all the leads  and the story  while not what i  d call chilling  was still effective and it kept me interested  for me  the best part of this film was the look of the picture  for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well  i also thought that the low budget suited this movie  for i don  t think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim  all things considered  it fell a little short of my expectations  but i  m still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie           imagine this  a high school  except it  s boarding school  and the kids don  t have parents around  oh  and it  s in malibu  and the kids are all thin  white  and gorgeous  with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the   weird   outcast  and there aren  t any reasonable rules  like how they have co habitation  nuclear weapons in their dorms  coffee stands  a sushi bar  and a complimentary laptop per student  br    br   here  s the story  a girl  zoey brooks  attends pca  a formerly all boys school  absolutely perfect in every possible way  she is smart  pretty  thin  athletic  creative  and everything a perfectionist wants to be  almost all the boys in school want her  and every girl wants to be her friend  she  s the one everyone comes to for advice  the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan  and is just wonderful  too bad none of this makes her likable  br    br   are we supposed to believe that if we don  t even come close to zoey  s perfection  we  re bad people  in the show  nothing  s her fault  and if anyone contradicts her  they  re portrayed as the bad guy logan   he may be a jerk  but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time  br    br   her loyal group of blind followers are  chase  the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her  michael  the token black guy  and the only decent actor on the set   lola  a wannabe actress and anorexic  snobby airhead  quinn  the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff  and logan  the rich jerk who has a soft side  yeah  this show basically spews out stereotypes  br    br   what ticks me off  though  is that they all try to pretend they  re normal kids  they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves  even though they already go to a too good to be true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can  t afford  they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis  hardly have homework  and suntan almost every day  wow  they have it hard  any other problems  i  m too good looking  rich  and stress free  i guess zoey      what  s the     for  anyway   is nick  s attempt at trying to portray teens realistically  except they caught a glimpse of reality  didn  t like it  and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills  br    br   but hey  at least the set  s pretty           i had been amazed by director antal  s kontroll back in       his first american project  vacancy  was less impressive but a decent start  armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable  the film never rises above the level of a b movie   br    br   it  s a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver  antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick  then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn  t really deliver in that department either   br    br   what you are left with is one implausible situation after another  a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money  if you look past the sharp cinematography  cast and the tight music score  you  re left with what could have been a below average direct to video featuring van damme or seagal   br    br   this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time           first of all  the reason i  m giving this film   stars instead of   is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo  he alone can get    stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie  br    br   i was initially all fired up at reading one poster  s comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave   the performance of his career    to me  it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie  and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment  then i thought to myself  what else has stevens done  so i checked and  you know  that person was absolutely right  in the    years since this columbo movie was made  apparently every one of the    projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap  so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career  br    br   if you like columbo  see every other of the    titles before watching this one  do yourself a favor and save the worst for last           this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years  not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom  br    br   the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not  nothing is of any interest  the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful   i just sat in utter amazement during this movie  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining  br    br   the producers of this movie were very clever  they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast  people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think  woody harrison  kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie  boy are they in for a horrible time  br    br   if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning          down at the movie gallery  i saw a flick i just had to see  it looked like a fun low budget horror action western that i could get into  yeah  i knew it would suck  but i rented it anyway hoping for laughs  only a few laughs were to be found  this was an extremely stupid movie  it begins with a bounty hunter  our protagonist  who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film  he looks acts like he could take on chuck norris  but he can  t  his dialogue sucks too  anyway  he goes into a village  shoots some zombies  you could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes     minutes to reload or watch some zombies  at least the zombies look cool  so anyway  some people get shot  some zombies die  and in the end  everyone is dead except our main character  who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people           i am finally seeing the el padrino movie  from what i can see it is an incredible film  and lots of action damian chapa is good director  but i must admit i love his acting the best  br    br   also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga  she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit  br    br   however the film el padrino is a pure    action epic  why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is  i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also  br    br   i am one of those people who love to see artists make it  br    br   b s          i thrive on cinema    but there is a limit  a name isn t enough to make a movie   the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet  but we remain hungry   or angry    till the end   things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense  the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed  next            michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems  nonetheless  to be regarded as a perfect   catch   by any woman that runs across him  could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co produced the film  he  s a   hero   whom it  s very difficult to empathize with  so the movie is in trouble right from the start  however  it  s troubles don  t end there  it has the production values of a tv movie  check out that head made of clay or something  near the end   and the ending cheats in a way that i can  t reveal  in case anyone wants to see the movie  highly unlikely   let  s just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows                  i was drawn to   friends   by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston  i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make  recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called   seasons    then i found the elton john song   friends   thinking it was the same song   it  s been    years of so  anyway  the flood of the emotions of   friends   came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love  i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production  plot  etc  so forgive me for a rather poor review  i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary eyed at the end as i was  i  m both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now  so many movies which seemed so important to me back then  i e    the graduate     easy rider    now just seem silly and i don  t want this to fall into the same category  but  i will find it and if it turns out silly  then at least i  ll be able to turn my wife onto a great   no  outstanding soundtrack  when we met  we went through this with   last tango in paris    the youngsters i work with  i  m     respect my opinions but it  s hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little   aged   now  i just can  t figure out if the the aging process is the movies    or me    friends   is a very special  sensitive and wonderful movie  it will bring back a lot of special feelings i  m sure  by all means  rent or buy a copy    indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today           during the clete roberts preface  i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production  however  what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff  the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast culled from hollywood  s poverty row  and this makes the movie all the more realistic  there are no punches pulled here  and at times the film is reminiscent of   the well          the black and white texture gives a newsreel like quality  for certain  younger viewers will be reminded of   the blair witch project   but this one is based on real events           i decided to watch this one because it  s been nominated for oscar this year  i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie  but ended up bored and disappointed  first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in   shaky hands   camera mode is really annoying  br    br   i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this  br    br   american   military machine    people  who makes money on war  urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something  sort of  patriotic  br    br   why these   heroic   efforts of director and the main character to  inspire  the audience with an idea of   loving war like a drug      oh  please  come on  what a bore   br    br   watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall             mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title  br    br   this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there  br    br   it is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation  br    br   the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger  who just happens to be a flesh eater  who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie  or ghoul  quite which exactly is not defined  br    br   there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified  attempts to help her by supplying   food     i shall say no more about that  for fear of inserting a spoiler   it is one of those   quiet   movies as opposed to guns blasting  explosions raging  car chases  etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish  but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans  whilst also inserting sadness into the story  along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so called   horror   movies  br    br   there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film  where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so   innocent    but  what she becomes   oh my   br    br   a gem of a movie and even if not your thing  should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan           empire of passion starts out deceptively   that is  if you  re immediately expecting it to be a horror movie  it  s like a riff on james m  cain  s the postman always rings twice  at first  seki  kazuko yoshiyuki  is a mother of two and a dutiful  hard working wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo  takahiro tamura   but when he  s not around  and she  s at home with the baby  the feisty and aimless young man toyoji  tatsuya fuji  comes around to bring some goodies for seki    and a little extra  they  re soon sleeping together  but after he does something to her  let  s just say a   shave     he knows that he  ll find out  and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo  they drink him up  strangle him  and then toss him down a well  naturally  this will come back to haunt them   but that it  s literally  at least to them  at first super terrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji   changes gears into the   kaidan    a japanese ghost story  br    br   this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of   oh  ghost  ah    but out of the total dread that builds for the characters  in a way there  s the mechanics of a film noir at work throughout  if only loosely translated by way of a   th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town  i e  the snooping cop  the   evidence   found possibly by another  word getting around  suspicions aroused  etc   it  s compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start  manipulated by the lustful but ill prepared toyoji  and her reactions to gisaburo  s re appearances are staggering to her  take the one that comes closest to poetry  gisaburo  s ghost  pale blue face and mostly silent  chilling stare  motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw  she does  reluctantly  and he pushes her around on a road she doesn  t know  in the wee hours before dawn  surrounded by smoke  most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric  br    br   while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end  there  s so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work  after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses  which  ironically  got banned in his own country   he made something that  he claimed  was even  more  daring that   senses    maybe he was right  empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor  also starring tatsuya fuji  a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range   but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread  you can believe in ghosts in this story  but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would be lovebirds will go  the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries  the fate of their very souls is at stake  br    br   and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp  sadly  it wouldn  t surprise me if an american remake was already in the works  and crafts shot after gorgeous shot  with repetition working its way into the mis en scene  i e  the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road  the camera at a dutch angle  the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue  as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this  i e  toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion  or how seiko  s nude body is revealed after she becomes blind   it  s daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit  not to be confused with the spiritual  though there may be something with that as well  about life and death  s connections to one another  inextricably  it  s a classic waiting to be discovered           i am not a big music video fan  i think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song   any song  in other words   creative thinking goes out the window  likewise  personal feelings aside about mj  toss aside  this was the best music video of alltime  simply wonderful  it was a movie  yes folks it was  brilliant  you had awesome acting  awesome choreography  and awesome singing  this was spectacular  simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man   but was he a man or something sinister  vincent price did his thing adding to the song and video  mj was mj   enough said about that  this song was to video   what jaguars are for cars  top of the line  perfecto  what was even better about this was  that we got the real mj without the thousand facelifts  though ironically enough  there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around  folks go to youtube  take    mins  out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is           oh  my goodness  i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon  but here it is  armed with rotten plot  terrible editing  stilted acting  and headache inducing   style    sorry  i have no other words for it   sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re evaluate an entire genre  that is  this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better  br    br   now  not only sanctimony is a terrible film in itself  it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it  right from the main titles    nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se en    i was under the impression that something didn  t smell quite right  as soon as the movie started with a series of corny  wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors  i knew where that smell was coming from  br    br   it turns out that two policemen  or rather policeman jim renart  michael par    and policewoman dorothy smith  jennifer rubin   are investigating on a murder spree in vancouver  a serial killer  known as   monkey killer    what a menacing  chilling nickname  uh   for his working methods  has killed quite a lot of people  you see  this nut apparently works following the proverb   see no evil  hear no evil  speak no evil   and cuts eyes  ears  and tongues out of his victims  so far  six eyes  six ears  and three tongues  in very ingenious fashion  renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people    well  because he probably wants to complete the number      so suddenly the film focuses on tom gerrick  casper van dien   a young  successful  good looking businessman  with a dreadful temper  and that  s where the rip off of american psycho kicks in  br    br   so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath  none of which is interesting in the least  until they finally meet  along the way to that  a disco where renart barely misses gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory  renart goes in the back of the disco club  because    well  just because the script tells us it  s a suspect place  then  with one single punch in the stomach  renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path  and the guard is never heard of again  does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic  br    br   anyway  after another murder  gerrick turns in as a witness  but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer  in typical basic instinct fashion  smith gets some dates with the young businessman  under the assumption that she might discover his true identity  br    br   i won  t spoil the ending but it is  quite simply  an embarrassment  there are contradictions  some plot holes  issues that never get resolved  and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder  supposed to be shocking and sad  comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can  t imagine how anyone could not laugh at it  br    br   at    minutes  sanctimony is really pushing it  you never care about one single character  because they are all so flat  not to mention boring  that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them  you are never pulled into the story  because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place  the acting ranges from average  van dien  to downright atrocious  rubin  and most of the supporting cast   the music is abysmal generic techno  and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen  of course  like every fiasco of the genre  we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity  br    br                 the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction  the other two were monkey on my back and a hatful of rain  but i think of the three this one is the best  br    br   maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet  who knows  maybe preminger couldn  t get enough money to pay for the location  it  s the only flaw i find in the film  br    br   frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss robert strauss when the game was raided  he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer  but a whole lot of people are conspiring against him  br    br   first bob strauss who wants him back dealing  especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town  he uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra  s services back  secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again  and finally eleanor parker his clinging wife who  s working a con game to beat all  just to keep him around  br    br   frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film  but lost to ernest borgnine in marty  sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn  t won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year  his scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak  s apartment will leave you shaken  br    br   eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role  she  s really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost  if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody  she might have been nominated for this       marked the high point of her career   br    br   darren mcgavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler  his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl  br    br   elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in  not a place you  d want to bring up your family           this film was basically set up for failure by the studio  one  anne rice  author of the book  offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio  two  they tried to stuff   in depth novels in to a  hour movie  br    br   i maintain the only way for these two books  vampire lestat and queen of the damned  to work in a live action form would be through a mini series  first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the       s to the       s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character  lestat  the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned  without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed  br    br   lestat was not cruel and vicious to all  he was not wanting to go along with akasha  s plans  marius did not make lestat  lestat did not love jesse or make her  lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light  marius was not after david nor the other way around  every character was completely represented wrong  basically same names different story  br    br   if they wanted to make a vampire movie  fine  even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels  fine  but don  t piggie back into the theaters off the success of rice  s great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love  br    br   if you haven  t read the books you won  t understand the film really  if you have read the books you will be insulted  that being said  i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it  catch     must see it  will hate it           have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more  even from a score of     imdb  the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal  the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a   worst case scenario   of playing   strong   feelings accompanied by some bad acting    don  t waist your time this movie   xadsnt entertaining  if you wanna cry it might suffice though  even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy    br    br   i give this      it really was awful  if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it  its all the good things this movie isn  t           an intense thriller about a mute movie make up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night  after she tries to get away from the murder scene  she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness  this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat           don  t listen to most of these people  ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love  its about jill johnson  played by camilla belle  who babysits at the mendrakis   house and someone breaks in  if you  re wondering how he got in the house  he went through the garage most likely  so anyway  don  t listen to    the worst acting    it has amazing acting  with a great story  i think that there are   benefits that jill has     shes a fast runner and is on the track team    she got out alive  lol  br    br   it is a cool movie and quite scary  check it out  you will be happy with this masterpiece  don  t listen to the other people on the site  its very good  trust me  i am good at reviewing movies  i  m a future movie critic  i totally want to buy this movie  and you will too when you see it  it is amazingly awesome           what a frustrating movie  a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces  as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows  this does none of that  instead  the writers settled for cutesy twinkles  cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama  the thing looks like a made for tv movie  and was directed with no particular distinction  but it  s hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting  br    br   the most frustrating aspect  though  is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast  all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this  well  there  s no other word for it  drivel  a tragic waste of talent  in particular that of the great stockard channing           this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the     s  jack pearl  radio  s   baron munchausen    as well as jimmy durante  however        decades later  it  s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today  film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts  br    br   as for the stooges  this is a film from there very early days  before mgm had any idea what to do with the team  at this point  they were known as   ted healy and his stooges   as healy was the front man  fortunately for the stooges  they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man  read up on him  you  ll see what i mean  and the rest is history  within a year  they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team  this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm  a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy  such as the films of buster keaton  laurel and hardy  abbott and costello and others   in fact  up until they left for columbia  mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles  including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady  and  oddly  in this film they didn  t act as a team  they just did various supporting roles  such as larry playing the piano  br    br   this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle  when they are rescued and brought home  all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show  punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there  as for pearl  i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films  as he has the personality of a slug  but slightly less welcome   as for durante  i never knew what the public saw in him  as least as far as his films are concerned  he was loud and   loud  he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton  s career to make this film  together  pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor    and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat  br    br   in this film  the stooges they didn  t yet have the right chemistry  seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd  what they did in the film was pretty good  but because all the segments were short  they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines  stooges fans might be very frustrated at this  though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge  even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films  oh  and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly   br    br   overall  the film is rather dull and disappointing  however  there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess  at about the    minute mark  you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing  look carefully  as this is walter brennan in a role you  d certainly never expect  another unusual thing to look for in the film is the   clean as a whistle   song starting at about    minutes into the film  this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called   pre code   scene that never would have been allowed in films after       when the production code was strengthened   despite the word   clean   in the title  it  s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh  enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything  it  s quite shocking when seen today  though such excesses were pretty common in the early     s  finally  at the    minute mark  see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades  see the film  you  ll see that i mean           when carol  vanessa hidalgo  starts looking into her brother  s death  she begins to suspect something more sinister than   natural causes    the closer she gets to the truth  the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law  fiona  helga line   and the rest of the local satanists  they  ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways  br    br   if you  re into sleazy  satanic themed movies  black candles has a lot to offer  the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex  one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed  unfortunately  all the sleaze in the world can  t save black candles  most of the movie is a total bore  other than the one scene i  ve already mentioned  the numerous sex scenes aren  t shocking and certainly aren  t sexy  the acting is spotty at best  even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance  the plot really doesn  t matter  its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together  i  m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz  compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror  black candles comes off as amateurish       is about the best i can do           one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history  zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers  the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer  and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued  others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal  unlike many serial killers  zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self promoter  the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off  the film is constructed as a murder mystery  or a   cold case   style thriller  it is an intelligent investigative procedural style horror film that will put off gore hounds in search of cheap thrills  br    br   some people dislike any movie that is shot on video  this attitude is very old style and provincial  it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value  these attitudes are on the way out  zodiac killer is a low budget film  no doubt  but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem           i  ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life  eg what it takes to get into music school   britney bashing  etc  etc  so let  s focus on the movie and the message  br    br   i have rated this movie   out of    for the age range   to    years  and for a family movie  for the average adult male       out of     br    br   i like pop rock music  i  m     i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews  i didn  t recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any   self promotion    br    br   i watch movies to be entertained  i don  t care about casting  lighting  producers  directors  etc  what is the movie and does it entertain me  br    br   i watched this movie for the message  the world  s greatest epidemic is low self esteem  which is a whole other story  so watched with the message in mind  as that is an area of interest  the movie is light  bright and breezy  great for kids  i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don  t give up message  so yeh  it was a bit predictable  great message though   should be more of them  br    br   this movie is a great family movie  but for a bloke watching by himself  get hannibal           i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema  made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies  it is filled with super surfer greg noll  s home movies  and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his    year passion  nevertheless  it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory  it is filled with artistic talent  and athletic talent  however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic  surfers are not astronauts nor test pilots  nor are they surgeons perhaps  or ph d  s again  perhaps   it believes in the quest of the surfer  it believes in the beauty of human goofiness  it believes in the great gift of peace  which comes from the cessation of war  surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before  it celebrates the down time of a country which fought a cold war instead of a hot war   with the russian socialists  surfing is the ultimate narcissism  it is dangerous  but only slightly historical  i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique  he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received  this movie has no military heroes  it has no guns  the only beach head surfers conquer has a beer stand and and a surfboard shop  this is not a problem  peace is not desperate  it is the joy of exhalation           i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode  it was dumbed down to such an extent  i doubt if i learned a single thing  the graphics were rudimentary  any small idea was repeated ad nauseum  contrast this to the cosmos series hosted by carl sagan  that had a good musical theme  there was no music coming from these infernal    dimensional strings           although the plot of this film is a bit far fetched  it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and gambon  the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent  caine hams it up   which is exactly what the character he is playing should do  entertaining and fun  this is a hour and a half of easy watching           this movie was so badly written  directed and acted that it beggars belief  it should be remade with a better script  director and casting service  the worst problem is the acting  you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished  professional and totally believable  and on the other hand  ri  chard  who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece  peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning  and keeping  couple  although both normally do fine work  the actors  and director  should not have attempted to do accents at all  they are inconsistent and unbelievable  much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english  the casting is ludicrous  why have children of an   african   merchant  thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society   been cast with very pale skinned actors  while the supposedly socially desirable marcel  has pronounced african features  including an obviously dyed blond   fro    it  s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color  it  s just so weird  this could be a great movie and should be re made  but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors  there are plenty of good actors out there  and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals  daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast  good script and decent direction           when i was a younger oh about   i watched barney for the first time  and liked it  but  back then i didn  t exactly have a brain  either  and now i look back and see what a horrible show   barney   really is  first of all  everything on that show is creepy  barney  the main character  is a horrendous   foot tall talking  purple dinosaur that teaches    year olds about   imagination        shudders   b j  i know what your thinking about his name  is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be   supposudly   cool  but in fact  he is the exact opposite  after watching a few episodes with b j  dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap  and making a few no so funny jokes  i wanted to scream  baby bop oh oh god   vomits  oh oh oh anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever  she is a green triceratops it  s a dinosaur  that carries a yellow blanket  her remarks of   hee hee hee   and barney  s praises cries of   super deeee doooper    make it hard to sit through each episode  as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners  br    br   and that  my friend  is what makes this show truly horrible           steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there  he certainly was a charismatic fellow  one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew  but even mcqueen can  t save this turkey of a film  shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st  louis  br    br   mcqueen  s a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang  there  s more than a broad hint that there  s a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke  he  s not liked at all by the other heist members  mainly because of his lack of criminal resume   br    br   steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot  especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke  all pretty rough characters  that would certainly get my suspicions aroused  br    br   the great st  louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix  guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn  t do much of anything  one of those two jokers decided steve  s performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation   br    br   this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen  i  m willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can  t believe they would have if they saw this  br    br   or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey           this is a bad film  as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts  as a result  it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr  huston should have been proud of making  however  the film is worth watching if you are a fan of   pre code   films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out  even if they aren  t married and even if their partner is    br    br   the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi  in the process  she meets a scalawag  bruce cabot  who eventually convinces her to sleep with him  she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman  however  miss dunne does not want him back  as she realizes he  s not worth it  but later her baby dies at child birth  while all these very controversial plot elements are used  they are always alluded to  almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way  kids in the audience will be clueless  after all  films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time   br    br   surprisingly  this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about     of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to  it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it  tacking it on to still another film  in this second phase of the film  miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women  s prison  though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there   what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate  and  as a result of all this violence  miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer  br    br   but then  out of the blue  another type of film emerges and the women  s prison reform business goes by the wayside  dunne meets a judge  walter huston  who is married but he desperately wants her  now throughout the film  dunne is portrayed as a very good girl  even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot  she was more or less tricked into it   but now  single irene  who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man  he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only  but she never thinks to investigate if this is true  and with his assurance  off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business  but  while she  s pregnant with his love child  he  s indicted for being a crooked judge  he assures her he  s innocent  but he  s convicted and it sure sounds like he  s a scoundrel  using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune  then  in the final moments of the film  miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released  the film then ends  br    br   so  we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early   s idea of what a nice girl should be like  i gathered that she should be a strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships  this really undoes all the positives about dunne  s character and it  s really hard to imagine anyone liking the film  a strong women  s rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect  with a decent re write  this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film  but it couldn  t make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre code film           i caught this movie on the sci fi channel recently  it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go  two guys  one naive and one loud mouthed a    take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky  make shift tank truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them  things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker  what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie  unlike so many others  the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase suspense scenes  nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff  definitely worth checking out            very mild spoilers  a basic plot outline  no real details   br    br   if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations  i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in maryland  and the only reason i agreed to go   was because it was free  i expected a few chuckles  but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d  not much more then that  br    br   the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious  as we are given a look at jack black  s humble christian origins in a midwest american town  the film then takes us years into the future  to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass  the second half of tenacious d  we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name  finally  as the title suggests  the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled   pick of destiny    again  the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny  and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face  that said  there were times it felt a bit long  it  s only     minutes  but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter  the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds  and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot  which is fine  except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss   and when they miss  they miss bad  same thing with the songs  it is a musical  but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so   then kept going anyway  br    br   i will say that the r rating really saved this movie from bombing  the d  s humor simply couldn  t work without cussing  sex  and drug references  but unless you  re a real fan of the band  or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy  i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent    pick   will make you giggle a bit   but is it worth   bucks  i don  t think so  i was tempted to rate it a    but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres  a   seems more appropriate  just be sure it  s your style           i shall begin with a disclaimer  this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff  the game before watching  the movie relies on the audience  s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements  and it does so very subtly  do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it  ll be that much better  br    br   with that in mind  this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed  the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game  on steroids  yeah  the attention to detail in each scene  especially in the heavy action oriented ones  is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe  br    br   i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music  again  for those who are familiar with the ff  story and background  the music should not surprise anyone  although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation   br    br   once again  i myself having only played through ff  once  thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix  and that is the feel in most scenes  choreographed and organized  like a dance  br    br   in short  if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy    this film will blow you out of the water  if you  re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff  on playstation or pc  doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience  br    br   finally  i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film  characters move with fluidity  each scene background comes to life and tells its own story  for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot  i urge you to reexamine the animation  facial reactions  subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery  br    br   square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling  advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations  allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves  br    br   thanks square enix  the wait was well worth it           this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made  everything about it  acting  directing  script  cinematography  is dreadful  the alien  a human in sparkly suit  claims to be from a nearby universe  one assumes the scriptwriter meant   galaxy   but didn  t bother to get a dictionary to check his terms  a better title for the film would be   it came from the planet of plot contrivances    the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent  the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot  any thought to the passage of time is ignored  now it  s a couple days after meeting the alien  then bam  all of a sudden there  s only a couple hours left until zero hour  do yourself a favor and miss this movie  you will make yourself stupider for having watched it  the ending is particularly silly  and should have been accompanied by someone going   ta da       as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt  i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you  ll get cancer watching it  if you can watch the last    minutes without crapping yourself    enemies of freedom    honestly  laughing  you  re retarded           if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors  eating non ants  and conquering the world with a voice over narrative  then this is the movie for you  basically  a couple of scientists working out of a bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants  the most intelligent actors in this film  in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination  throughout the movie the two scientists  and a girl they rescued from the ants  use everything at their disposal  computers  green dye  and horrid acting   but to no avail  i guess they just couldn  t afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly  br    br   the title of the movie   phase iv   is something of a mystery  this is not a spoiler  but   phase i   starts right after the opening credits whereas you don  t reach   phase iv   until the end credits roll  apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases       throughout the movie as a kind of progress report    hang in there buddy  only   more phase until final credits    as a mst k episode  this one wasn  t very good for two reasons     this one is from the season   on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons  and    this movie is so bad not even j tb can lighten it up  there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing   gamera movies  br    br   the movie does have a trick surprise ending  but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me           joseph brady and clarence doolittle are two sailors  who have a four day shore leave in hollywood joe knows everything about girls and can  t wait to see lola  while clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls they then run into a little boy  donald martin  who has ran away in order to join the navy they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan  who wants to be a singer clarence wants susie to be his girl  but his shyness gets in the way but he doesn  t feel shy with a waitress  who comes from brooklyn  like he does soon joe notices he  s in love with susie the boys are in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don  t even know as they are in a fix with their feelings george sidney  s anchors aweigh        is a great musical comedy gene kelly is top notch  once again  in his singing and dancing routines frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn shy isn  t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra  but he plays his part well kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan abbott we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of    the   year old dean stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor jose iturbi does great job performing himself it  s magic what he does with the piano edgar kennedy plays chief of police station sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse there  s a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers just look at kelly and sinatra performing   we hate to leave   it  s so energetic   if you knew susie  like i know susie    is quite funny it  s a nice moment when frank sings brahms   lullaby to little dean stockwell it  s lovely to listen to grayson singing the tango   jealousy    the most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world  and there gene sings and dances with jerry mouse also tom cat is seen there as the butler they originally asked mickey mouse but he refused the movie was nominated for five oscars but georgie stoll got one for original music score anchors aweigh is some high class entertainment           from director barbet schroder  reversal of fortune   i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class  and i recognised the leading actress  so i tried it  despite the rating by the critics  basically cool kid richard haywood  half nelson  s ryan gosling  and justin pendleton  bully  s michael pitt  team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them  investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie   the hyena   mayweather  sandra bullock  with new partner sam kennedy  ben chaplin   who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene  e g  non relating hairs  the plan doesn  t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects  it is just a question of if they can sway them away  also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills  chris penn as ray feathers  r d  call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst  d a  al swanson  i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock  s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing  but this film does it in a very silly way  and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable  adequate           things to come is an early sci fi film that shows an imagined world  or   everytown   through     years  you can break it up into about   different scenes or parts  the film spans from      to      and is mainly about how this ruler or the   boss   wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again  after everytown was bombed and war broke out  br    br   this film only has about   faults  it  s audio is muddy and video had some quirks  the characters aren  t deep at all  and the overall plot isn  t altogether solid  the plot is lacking something that i can  t put my finger on    it just seems a little   fluffy    but if you love sci fi and are interested in what h g  wells though might happened in the next hundred years  this is a must see  it  s worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing  a long  drawn out war  because they were just about to go to war with germany  and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything  br    br   things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once           weak stale  tired  cliched  wants to be basic instinct  but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives  new insights  insipid  trite  grotesque  and without the possibly redeeming value of brevity  oh  wait   it was only    minutes long   it must have just  seemed  a lot longer  i  d rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again  i  m expressing an opinion here  i guess this means i didn  t like it           one word can describe this movie and that is weird  i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting  well it was  the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge  on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not  very strange  if you are a fan of animation science fiction you might want to check this out           while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem  i don  t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right  br    br   the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting  one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle  thrown together by fate  they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on  br    br   i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks  because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast  my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features  oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring  but all in all a excellent movie           this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today  not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors  so what went wrong  i don  t know and simply i don  t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all  be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish  but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot  a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father  s company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid  very stupid plot twists devices  i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience  if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather  what about lock  stock     thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film               i  ll not comment a lot  what  s to    stereotype characters  absolute ignorance about colombia  s reality  awful mise en scene  poor color choice  not funny  it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it  s beside the nonsense scenes   very poor actors direction  if you see somewhere those people  i mean the interpreters  you  ll know they are at least good  but seeing this so call film  it is impossible to guess it   you get tired of the music    this   comedy   has no rhythm  the only good rhythm in it  it  s the rap sing in the final credits    pathetic  doesn  t it  etc   etc    it has been a long time i haven  t seen a movie so bad            this movie is a riot  i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies  i  ve seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny  but this one is wall to wall great lines  i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in  the movie was non stop until the end when they did the   minutes of sentimental plot clean up  other than that it  s a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations  i  d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don  t get all the jokes the first time around  you have to see it two or three times to get it all in  br    br   as far as the actual film goes  it could have used a better edit  it  s choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that  all the characters are great  it  s not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke  i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable  no victims in this movie  also  thank god they got a    year old actress to play his girlfriend  catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film  you just wish that women like her really existed  she  s not a        like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite  br    br   if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it  i assure you  the trailer does not do it justice  they do not give away all the good jokes  just some of the mediocre ones  br    br   oh and one more thing  i hope critics put this on their top ten list  many of them complain that comedies don  t get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don  t put it on their list  this means you ebert             a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth   things must be pretty bad back on mars   two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash  whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy  s pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner  br    br   the diner has had no customers since eleven o  clock that morning  now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge  the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus  although he didn  t notice who they were  the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed  one of them is an alien  but which one  all of them are suspect  there  s the crazy old man  jack elam   of course  who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit  there  s a blustering businessman who must get to boston  john hoyt   a young couple on their honeymoon   execrable performance by the husband  ron kipling   except for the couples  nobody has noticed anyone else  and even the couples are suspicious of each other  bride to newly minted husband    i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin    the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way    the phone rings for no reason  the lights go on and off  the juke box turns itself on    and none of it is to be taken seriously  br    br   it  s a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle  there is no discernible   depth   to it  it  s not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens  it  s not a warning of any kind  just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses  br    br   i always enjoy it when it  s on  it  s especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman  knowing that in      he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm  s version of shakespeare  s play  and here he is    with three arms  br    br   oops           it  s rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site  but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created  and how bias its product was  br    br   i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film makers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy  we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression  yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population  we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager  we only hear from other palestinians in prison  i understand restrictions are in place  but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace  br    br   i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence  so to speak  she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber  s parents  and her angry and closed minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control  it is more realistic  in my mind  to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem  ignored pleas for understanding and freedom  ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land  br    br   i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother  which normally would be admirable in a documentary  however in the light of the lack of impartiality  it all seems exploitative  also for the poor edits  lack of background in the actual instance  and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side  ultimately  it is a poor documentary and a poor film  i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation  but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart wrenching and sad subject matter           relentless like one of those loud action movies  the entire cast seems to be on speed  i didn  t quite get the director  s intentions if any  i wonder if she  s ever seen a stanley donen  vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical  structure  please  this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba  the costumes the unflattering photography   unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations  the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself  no chemistry with her friends  christine baranski and julie walters  think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you  ll understand what i was hoping for  i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth  the audience  however  seemed to enjoy it so it probably it  s just me           this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space  as a history of space flight  it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it  disney has shown it on   vault disney   and i wish they would do so again           in an alternate     s  where an outbreak of the undead  caused by a mysterious   space dust    has been contained through the use of special electronic collars  a young loner  timmy  finds a friend in fido  billy connelly   his family  s recently acquired domesticated zombie  br    br   fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy  whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son  or for his hot to trot wife  played by the gorgeous carrie anne moss  having been psychologically scarred as a child  when he was forced to shoot his own father  who tried to eat him    br    br   timmy runs into a spot of bother  however  when his putrid pal  s collar goes on the blink  and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour  with the authorities on fido  s trail  trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies  and his mother forming a bond with their undead house help  will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend  br    br   a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick  fido is a thoroughly entertaining  deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour  taking the romero zombie verse and transplanting it into     s small town america is a stroke of genius  and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole   reanimated dead   theme that i have seen  br    br   connelly  s fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame  along with day of the dead  s bub  and return of the living dead  s tarman  it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse  but the big yin  s performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus  the rest of the cast also give commendable performances  with young k  sun ray  as timmy  and ms moss deserving special mentions  ray  because  for one so young  he puts in a particularly assured turn  and moss because she is so bloody yummy  br    br   this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week  the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead   and  to my surprise  it is also the best  director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future  br    br       out of     rounded up to   for imdb           an extremely down to earth  well made and acted   rodeo   western  no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the     s and     s west  but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance  especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life  his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the   ups and downs   of the hard nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style  he and mr  coburn teamed up extremely well as partners  not only on the circuit itself  but also in the real world outside the corral  also  check out anne archer as coburn  s native american love interest in the latter part of the movie  must have been one of her first roles   br    br   not as flashy  perhaps  as   junior bonner    but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal  thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an under rated movie from time to time           despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm  i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as   mills and boon    so what  it is good to see a warm  touching story of real love in these cynical times  many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes  you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other  even though  for political reasons  it was an arranged marriage  i did feel though that sir john conroy  who was desperate to control the young queen  is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain  as it is rumoured that he was in fact  the real father of victoria  as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent  it would have been interesting to explore this theory  emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess  trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her  she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england  which prospered as never before  under her long reign  i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie             american nightmare   is officially tied  in my opinion  with   it  s pat    for the worst movie of all time  br    br   seven friends  oddly

life  these fears include such stunners as   voodoo   and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures  br    br   no  really  br    br   this movie was  in a word  rotten  crazy nurse  s killing spree lacks motivation  there  s nothing to make the viewer   jump    the ending blows  and  again  voodoo  br    br   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones  rent   american nightmare   with them  br    br   if you care for your loved ones  even a little bit  go to your local blockbuster  rent all of the copies of   american nightmare   and hide them in your freezer           first off  i have to say that i loved the book animal farm  i read it with my  th grade class  and it was great  we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial  the movie was so disappointing to me  the movie cuts out some characters  and misses a lot of the main points of the book  it skips around a lot  and doesn  t explain anything in detail  if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book  they would be confused  the most disappointing thing in this movie to me  was the ending  the ending in the book was the most powerful  and in the movie  they changed it  it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of   melting   together  but instead  the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs  to sum up  i don  t think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book           this movie was extremely boring  i only laughed a few times  i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner  s name on the cover  it  s all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates  when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist  he meets a prostitute  she takes him to a club called the playground  where he befriends several pimps  when mayor tony gold  shatner  decides to take over the pimp business  lil   pimp must lay down for his homies  br    br   the animation isn  t very good in this  it looks like it was made with macromedia  which i  m sure it was  it doesn  t suck  it  s just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years  the humor in this is not very good  i didn  t think any of it was funny           i was disgusted by this movie  no it wasn  t because of the graphic sex scenes  it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi  this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art  it shows one piece of art work that she did  judith beheading holofernese  but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial  br    br   i don  t know if you understood this from the movie  probably not  tassi was not a noble character  he raped artemisia  it was not love  it was rape  he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured  according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia  aka had sex with  while she states over and over again   it  s true    br    br   i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about  don  t base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie  i encourage you to do some research  artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work  br    br   don  t see the movie  but find out the true story of artemisia           such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar  s a bug  s life  we  re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film  but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation  for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer    when it  s in the right hands that is    a bug  s life is a warm reminder  we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling  and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions  br    br   it is only pixar  s second animated feature  the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in       with their landmark movie toy story  it was a movie which defied convention  re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence  now  they return with their sophomore effort which  to be honest  draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film  br    br   after all  it  s a film about ants  well  all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug  s life  but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film  as humans are the focal point in dramas  romances and so on  how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie  let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film  surely they jest  however  we forget that in toy story  a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest  most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted  the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat  and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you  ll probably ever encounter  br    br   not only are they all entirely amiable and likable    there isn  t an unpleasant character in sight  even the villains are riveting characters    but they  re colourful  they  re eclectic  and they  re idiosyncratic  and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term  only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug  s life from the beginning  we shall start with our main character  and our hero  his name is flik  david foley   and his character is rather generic to say the least  out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush  beautiful ant island  he is the one considered the   black sheep   of the clan  as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season  s harvest with his antics  br    br   the problem arises in the fact that the ants   harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper  kevin spacey   who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants  when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone  they go insane  for lack of a better term  hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack  s hands  however  it  s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil  the cogs and clockwork in flik  s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame  and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony  s rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers  br    br   if you think about it  a bug  s life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line  s of akira kurosawa  s classic seven samurai  or the american remake the magnificent seven  in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies    one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city  finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil  in a bug  s life  the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl  br    br   much amusement comes out of these scenes  and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs  among them are an erudite stick insect  david hyde pierce   a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who  s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug  dennis hopper   it  s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen  as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen  as is the entire movie collectively  br    br   as i  ve said  much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another  which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines  wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie  what makes a bug  s life even better is that the film isn  t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be  although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film    the clich  d kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we  d like  however  it  s easy to ignore this fault  and it  s incredulously easy to enjoy this film  br    br   although a bug  s life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor  this is still a superb movie  and the start of something promising here  pixar have proved that they  re not just a one hit wonder  but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood  they raise the bar endlessly  and when someone always manages to top their standards  it  s only always by themselves  what more is there to say about a bug  s life other than  see it  it  s not quite the best which we  ve seen from the folks at emeryville  california  but this beats out the lot of its year    and i  ll be damned if this isn  t the best animated feature of       br    br                  what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel  i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original  this version is no different  i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever   anyway back to this version  it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style  it succeeds in both but high art it is nit  throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe   the direction was average and the editing abysmal  worse than the old quincy  deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents  the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project  although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had  its clear that he was a director for hire and didn t instill the project with the passion that it deserved          my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger  it  s about andre  a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter  katharine heigl  on a vacation  hoping to get a little closer to her  but of course  nicole isn  t that easy to get along with  she just started puberty  i  m guessing  she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time  one day at the beach  nicole meets handsome ben  and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad  the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie  i would give my father the hero               it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days  especially for television  considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes  not to mention lesbianism  this has been given superb treatment and direction  br    br   the sets and costumes are flawless  the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable  there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes  the protagonist is really a tragic figure  but not devoid of happiness  also  this production avoids the mistake most films shows make when dealing with homosexuality lesbianism  the characters are very human  it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay  not so with this  in tipping the velvet  the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means  br    br   the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past  and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts           i just don  t get some of the big premises of this episode   that miranda is so remarkable  and that there  s anything so ugly it would make you insane  someone here made the remark that maybe it  s the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness  miranda is just a jerk  the episode is slow  inconsistent and way too talky  i also don  t quite understand why kolos is an ambassador   why doesn  t the federation just leave the damn medusans be  there  s one part i do like  when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience  overall  i love tos and even at its lamest  i  ll always tune in  this episode though   mmm  i wouldn  t purchase it except for a used copy under              this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone  on my list of favorite movies  mental list  mind  the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series  spirited away and fly away home  br    br   i can really relate to the main character jess  at the start of the movie she  s a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls  she really sucks you into her life  i also certainly can  t fault any of the protagonist  s acting  or anyone else  s in the film  br    br   the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules  the movie is never boring  the romance is really cute and didn  t make me blush tooooo hard  one thing that really made it though was the indian factor  jess   parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else  the indian people are also hilarious  essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it  br    br   feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film  they  re funny  they  re refreshing and they make you feel good               i know that you  ve already entered this in film festivals  or at least i think you have  i may just be making that up  but i think this should get   best animated short film   in every one  bravo  i can  t wait for the full film  i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations  but hear it now and accept it as the truth  kudos  my friend  okay  now i  m just trying to get ten lines of text    though i still mean it  and here comes yet another  shoe   and i cannot stop here yet  this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do  in fact  i  ll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic   jason steele marathon    i do have a lot of those  br    br    r          this is probably the first entry in the   lance o  leary nurse keat   detective series  in subsequent o  leary films  he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee  br    br   a group of relatives  all played by well known character actors  gathers in an old house  on a rainy nite  of course   to speak to a wealthy relative  who goes into a coma  br    br   while they wait for him to recover  all sorts of mysterious goings on happen  including a couple of murders  br    br   a creepy film  worth seeing           this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs  evil plot and is all about action  what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated  it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around  her movements were done so well  why don  t they use this rotoscopic technique more these days  it  s quite effective  br    br   fire and ice  in it  s prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women  was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways  her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy  some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy  others  including plenty of women  will adore it  s esthetic quality  i for sure did not mind  bakshi just loves animating lushious  voluptuous babes  as can also be seen in cool world  and i don  t think he has to apoligize since it  s pretty much animation for adults  but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it  br    br   this one was just special  so different from the standard disney or anime fare  and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it  s possibly bakshi  s finest  for those who like animations with lushious women  try space adventure cobra as well  br    br   i give fire and ice   out of              my ratings  acting        suspense        character attachment        plot        character development        overall        br    br   this show sucks very much officially  for me  csi miami is the best  csi ny  nd and csi    th  i don  t know  in the other csis you get into the episode you  re watching  but in this one  you just can  t get into the episode  no matter how much you try  so in my opinion  this show is not worth watching  i know people have different opinions  and i respect that  but for me  this csi ain  t good enough  so if you like suspense  real acting performance  good plot  direction  character development attachment and you an overall good show  i suggest you to watch csi miami           i am not a faulkner fan  which is considered sacrilegious  especially since i grew up near the author  s hometown   however  i think this is an excellent movie  on par with the quality of the movie   to kill a mocking bird    if you haven  t seen it  buy it anyway  it  s well worth having in your permanent collection  tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series  i wish they  d play it more often  very moving  br    br   on a side note  the folks from oxford  mississippi  will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the       s  the courthouse  city hall  etc   they  re all on screen  i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings  when i saw the arch in the front of city hall  i began to get suspicious  look closely at the pennants on chick  s wall  you  ll see two for ole miss            chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films  the film delivers the spell casting special effects that one can expect  but fails painfully on all other fronts  the actors all play extremely silly caricatures  you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny  the plot is predictable  and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow  towards the end  the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films  including shabby larger than life special effects and a  well  yet another  ghost with a godzilla head  maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting camp  br    br   it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with   in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula  they won  t be able to do it again  the cash cow is now dead as a dodo           i can  t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton  and sure it  s his company  but   you  re fired   or   you  re hired    for how many seasons now  after watching the show i wouldn  t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve  br    br   i  d love to hear just one person get up and say   donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo    i see he  s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe  i hope he gets hurt so i don  t have to see his pathetic face anymore  it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it  i  d give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a   and it doesn  t deserve that           if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing dogme    style  i would never have rented it  nevertheless  i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot  i lasted a very  very  very long forty minutes before giving up  it  s just boring  pretentious twaddle  br    br   the last french movie i saw was   romance   and it too was pretty dismal  but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time  i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme    overseas    it  ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy   it  s called dogme    because that  s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera   br    br             the story and the show were good  but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies  ri  chard is great  he really put on a top notch performance  and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous  seriously  i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile  i can  t say anything bad about peter galleghar  he  s one of my favorite actors  i love anne rice  i  m currently reading the vampire chronicles  but i  m glad i saw the movie before reading the book  this is a little too  real   for me  i prefer lestat and louis  s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves  eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me  i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show   sorry for the ambiguity  but i don  t want to give anything away  sorry  but it  s just not my type of show           first  let me just comment on what i liked about the movie  the special effects were fantastic  and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game  there  that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film  in fact  i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can  t even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing   br    br   i have innumerable complaints about the film  but four major complaints jump to mind  my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the   plot twist    if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away  where lois  s   year old son turns out to be the super powered child of superman  when the crying super child throws a piano at lex  s henchman to save his mother  i almost got up and left the theater  singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super powered illegitimate child  it  s been   days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit   br    br   my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space  it doesn  t take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what  s wrong with that  i don  t know how many comic books brian singer has read  but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet  whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman related projects ever again  the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun  why not just have superman eat kryptonite  he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it  and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas  that  s not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground   br    br   my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie  i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god like jor el sent to earth to be a savior  jor el wasn  t all wise  he was just a scientist  and he didn  t send his son to earth to be a savior  he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode  i  ll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode  and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ  s primary weakness  furthermore  the   crucifixion   scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite   spear   just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i  m too brain dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future  they might as well rename this movie   superman returns  the passion of the christ    br    br   and speaking of luthor  my last major complaint has to do with singer  s depiction of lex luthor  lex luthor is a shrewd  cold hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president  which he does in the comics  than try to destroy the world  the man wants money and power  he wants to be in charge  not wreck everything  yet the luthor we see superman returns  as well as all the previous superman movies  is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world  if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the  quite awful  previous superman movies  this film might not be such an unbearable travesty  maybe singer  s next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from     s tv show  zam  whap  pow   br    br   to summarize  i don  t know what i hate more  the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews  everyone is entitled to their opinion  but if you don  t hate this movie then your opinion is wrong  i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven  t already  don  t see it  don  t buy it when it comes out on dvd  don  t rent it   basically don  t contribute any money towards it in any way  this movie does not deserve to make any money  in fact  i think that for every person that sees this movie  bryan singer should be fined    billion dollars  if you  re a superman fan and you really want to see this movie  just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you  ll get the same experience without having to waste   hours of your time           this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever  i have heard the merman cast album  the angela lansbury album  i have seen tyne daly live  and i  ve seen the rosalind russell movie countless times  i think bette is if not the best  then tied with the best  she captures not just the bravura  but also the pathos of mama rose  i was never a natalie wood fan  so i really enjoyed cynthia gibb  in what is arguably her best role  everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful  the three strippers  led by the always dependable christine ebersole are hard to top  there was supposed to be a tv production of mame a few years back  with cher  but i think bette would be the best bet  pun intended  for auntie mame           i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad  it reminds me of a c grade porn movie with one major difference  no porn  br    br   the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul  maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable  at the very least  the pacing should have been picked up  br    br   while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had  he should have spent more time on the story or better yet  get someone else to write it  many of the action scenes were just pointless  br    br   it was a complete waste of my time           is it a perfect movie  no  it is a weird adaptation from a sci fi book and it features vampires from space  naked beauties and the british army efficiency  br    br   when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may  actually  if it weren  t for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie  i probably wouldn  t have rated it so high  but given her sheer magnificence  i am now actually considering voting it up  br    br   lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now  imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci fi story  but with completely over the top performances  i still enjoyed the movie tremendously  as well as mathilda may   but it was a mixture of nostalgia  comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended  br    br   bottom line  if you are a sci fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie  oh  and did i mention mathilda may is young  beautiful and naked           overall i was rather impressed with the pilot  the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying  as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle  br    br   bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism  existentialism  reality  death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext  there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose  here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed  i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films television shows  which deal with the subjects i referenced  i think you will find at least something here  br    br   in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way  i especially liked how they explained where the cylon  s belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers  br    br   the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays   lacy rand    while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually  together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry  at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters  but this is something i think needs work  i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role  this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop  but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident  br    br   based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where   caprica   goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did           i  m the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season  from the b grade to the hollywood  but this movie was something different  i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable  but some bits were just weird  well the acting wasn  t to good  compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz  quite good  and ice t in new jack and svu  great   the scene where corrupt  ice t  kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice t and the other dude  this kills the jamaican  however ice t is unharmed  very similar to ice  s other movie urban menace  which stars both of these actors  were snoops character is supernatural  however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon  when mj  silkk  gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh with out blood  and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird  benny isn  t introduced in this movie and the scene isn  t in the film  it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head  wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn  t mention what happen   other main characters mj and lisa  the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide was a good part of the film  even though the clip of the projects was re used thousands of times  and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed  not wearing a helmet  and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him  the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team  it was ok tho  but me being from poverty i love hood films  however if u don  t love em like i do don  t watch it  only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with     dollars  and my love of the genre  br    br   nathaniel purez          i am a huge fan of the farcry game  huge fan  it still holds a place in my top    games list of all time  the story line was new  fresh    a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on    or so i thought    br    br   farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise  see doom  the movie  and many more      br    br   the video game begins as the player  jack carver  awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier  jack then finds a communication device where  harlan doyle  guides him across islands  shipwrecks  jungles  installations and volcanoes  to find his  lady friend    valerie constantine   all the wile battling mutated super soldiers  and genetically enhanced animals  br    br   the movie plays out very  very differently     there  s a needless    mins      of the movie  of   backstory   before we even get to the   boat blowing up   scene     jack then walks onto the beach  kills some goons  then drives off    nothing like the game       there is no communicator with doyle on the other end       the   modified soldiers   look like albinos with singlets on    and there was no mutated   monkey like   creatures jumping out of the bushes  a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot       there is no sun filled beach scenes  no aircraft carrier  no communications stations on huge cliffs  little reference to any in game contents  characters items vehicles   in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all     the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building     there  s an ending scene    where everyone  except krieger  live happily ever after    what the  br    br   i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs  if you are a gamer  you will hate this movie will all your soul  it is a movie clearly intended for males  so girls  stay away    so if your a male        years of age  have never played farcry  and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books games to the cinema    then this is for you             one of the best ensemble acted films i  ve ever seen  there isn  t much to the plot  but the acting  incredible  you see the characters change ever so subtly  undr the influence of the rented villa in italy  and love  and happiness  the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you  much as the villa does on all the women  truly   enchanted             i haven  t seen this movie in about   years  but it still haunts me   br    br   when asked about my favorite films  this is the one that i seem to always mention first  there are certain films  works of art like this film    dark city    and   breaking the waves    that seem to touch a place within you  a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive  that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer  not unlike a life changing event  such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend    this film   shook   me when i first saw it  it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days           today  i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood  br    br   hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation      changed everything  it changed our perception of security  it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity  most importantly and devastatingly   it changed our world  br    br   however  i can  t not stress how utterly repulsed  disillusioned  and angry i am at the careless  blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction  this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike  most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press  hollywood has sunk to a new low  even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty  behind it all is uwe boll  i am very angry at this movie  how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost  how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy      how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post     world       how   dare   they   br    br   to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty  i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength  remember  think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person  think back to that day  ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day  think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones  think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes  think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks  br    br   ask yourself if you have a soul  br    br   think  remember  respect the memories of the lives lost on     by not seeing this film at all           you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed  that  s why movies like fast and the furious  dhoom  rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences  especially local ones  we live on a tiny island  and i cannot fathom why  for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system  most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with      tax when they reach our shores  and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one  not only that  the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear  lest they reach the sea  br    br   and these movies are relatively easy to make  hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic  for once  those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long  can  t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these  of course there are amongst us  ahem  those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects  otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models  and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame   however  they don  t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen  even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park  the guy sitting beside me  i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car s  appear  and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans  br    br   so there we have it  the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie  with the fast and the furious franchise  the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage  as does the gt  here  the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification  that even i  m impressed  alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos  porshe carerra gts  koenigsegg ccxs  and every car out there that has wings for doors  but seriously  my heart goes out to the cars each time they  re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment  i mean  this are perfectly fine  high performance models that are at the apex of motoring  but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow  they do so because they can  br    br   there  s no story in redline  just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties  the cars that is  that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible  and with the usual shots of pedals  always the accelerator  mind you  tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy  and earn you no respect   steering wheels  gear shifts  always shifting up and not down   all these while having the actors make pretend that they  re the baddest asses with an engine  snarling and giving each other dirty looks  not a very tall order for an actor  and that  s why we get the most woeful performances ever  with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids  br    br   the heroine  yes  it made a statement that girls can drive  natasha  a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin  is one of those million dollar finds   a girl with model looks who don  t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil  who has racing pedigree within her  and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable  every line had to do with cars  and when singing about love  just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts  lubricants and going for rides   introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous  eddie griffin   she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran  and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle  everything else  well like i said  just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race  br    br   and it  s almost always the same  as there  s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars  especially when you know the race is rigged  for narrative reasons  and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line  while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors  and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker  sun kang  and of course  the star it created   vin diesel  redline had none  just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately  it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go  with a very insipid opening sequence where it  s one man  one car  and a     minutes race against time to get to vegas  br    br   if not for the cars  then this movie seriously is a piece of junk  with bad acting  bad lines and bad action  strictly for the car fans  or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines           im the type of person who always goes   to horror section when i  m picking a film  so i picked five across the eyes  i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish  i think i could of done better myself  i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch  i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul           seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene  but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt  bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds  when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel  gets into his mustang  which is parked under the embarcadero freeway  now torn down  and notices the charger sitting nearbye  you know you are about to see something spectacular  from that moment on  when mcqueen starts that car  begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed  adding to it is a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track  this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing  that shot of mcqueen  s mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman  s rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact  hickman  s look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect  then of course  san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends  also  bullitt being filmed in the   s when cars were still   hot    mustang gt and dodge charger  made for a better set of wheels then two boring  smog device laden pontiacs in the     s seven ups  bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies  i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper  they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene  seven ups had a few   jumps   over little hills   yawn  but of course they were not san francisco hills  the seven ups chase  where they are actually going fast  is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt  but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity  strictly hollywood  i would say  except that it was filmed in new york           have you ever heard the saying that people   telegraph their intentions    well in this movie  the characters   actions do more than telegraph future plans    they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head  this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better  or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced  embeth davidtz  s character is not mysterious  just wooden  and kenneth branagh doesn  t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have  br    br   the bottom line  obvious plot  one note performances  unlikeable characters  and grotesque   southern   accents employed by british actors             night of the living homeless   was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season     obviously a parody of various zombie movies  most notably dawn of the dead  this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead  as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains  br    br   kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he  out of the goodness of his heart  gives a     to a homeless man in front of his house  more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park  until the town is completely overrun with them  this is a very strong randy marsh episode  as he assumes the role of the shotgun wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center  but before randy makes it to the community center  he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming   i don  t have any change     unfortunately  the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless  when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town  and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people  then he becomes one of them  asking everyone for change  br    br   the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park  and find a man who is a director of homeless studies  they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless  so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem  unfortunately  homeless people break into the man  s house  and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself  however  he fails several times  as he shoots himself in the jaw  in the eye  in the chest  in the neck  in the shoulder  screaming horribly until he finally dies  this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in   fantastic easter special   two weeks ago  br    br   meanwhile  a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem  the property values have nosedived  thus the bank has foreclosed on his house  making him homeless  randy immediately turns on him  holding the gun to the man  s head  when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out  randy pulls the trigger  br    br   in evergreen  the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park  and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country  the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica  california  br    br   the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re watchable                 br    br   i  m not sure who decides what category a movie fits into  but this movie is not a horror movie  as for the story  it was fairly interesting  but rather slow  i was especially disappointed with the ending though  br    br     spoiler   br    br   tell me why on earth does she run over to her uncle  s    home without at least calling the detective or the police first  she knows exactly what  s going on at that point  plus she has a video tape as proof  instead  she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying   i know everything  i have proof  you didn  t expect proof  did you     then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he  s going to harm her  well duh  of course he  s going to harm you idiot  you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything  what a dumb ending          i gave this a    there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for  total mayhem  everyone gets killed or nearly so  i am tired of cross hairs and changing views  i cannot give the plot away  convoluted and insane  if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back  i wish reviews were more honest         not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sage s touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline  this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you ve seen something special                i read the book before seeing the movie  and the film is one of the best adaptations out there  very true and faithful to the book  sean penn and sarandon are amazing  robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire  he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow paced to add depth  an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end           docteur petiot  starring michel serrault  is a brutal story about a brutal man  a doctor who heals the sick in occupied france  even if their ability to compensate is not there  yet  he preys on the weakest amidst the populace  the imagery and cinematography are superb  and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story  he is the perfect psychopath  seductive and altruistic  intelligent and caring  calculating and murderous  a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer  kudos to mr  serrault  for his chilling portrayal           i just got this video used and i was watching it last night  the acting started out extremely bad  hey      hey      twister  but got very good soon after wards  the tornadoes looked extremely fake  and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy  but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done  and just about on par with movies like twister  the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too  the story was very well written  and it  s refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old   disaster formulas   movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for    years  br    br   while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality  this merits an a in my book           this film is really vile  it plays on the urban paranoia of the   s   s and puts it into a school context  i  m not saying that urban crime wasn  t a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren  t aren  t problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit  violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it  s not a case of social issues but a white  upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol  and of course he knows how to play the system  does that sound familiar  yes  this turd is pure violent exploitation  a really nasty piece of work  it  s disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment  this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator  death wish     and so on and so on  the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this           what a horrible  horrible film  the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time  not that i saw much  i left the theatre screaming after about    minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves  meryl streep was awful as usual  how many hurt and tortured expressions can   person have  aidan quinn  s talents were   as so often   totally wasted  and who told gloria estefan she could act  trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes   brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school   the kids weren  t even cute  just written in to suit the appalling script  aaargh  wes craven really made me cringe for once  real horror this one           motocrossed was fun  but it wasn  t that great  i guess i just didn  t understand a lot of the motocross racing   lingo    and there was a lot of that in the film   the plot wasn  t what i expected from the disney channel previews  so that could account for some of my disappointment           sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood  now he wants to broaden his horizons and    spoiler    needs a family member in order to do it  br    br   a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain  t scary at all  works better as a dark  macabre black comedy  to tell you the truth  freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer   too many wisecracks  that  s for sure   the actors aren  t interesting  save robert englund  as always  and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto  and there are simply far too many visual effects  the finale is ok but doesn  t provide as many sparks as i think one might hope  br    br   in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer  s story  it provides englund the opportunity to do more non makeup scenes than ever before  br    br   there are cameos worth noting  a joint cameo by then couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value  an appropriate appearance by veteran shock rocker alice cooper  and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become  br    br   film debut of breckin meyer  who plays spencer  br    br   one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits  br    br                 ok  i  m italian but there aren  t so many italian film like this  i think that the plot is very good for     of the film but the final is too simple  too predictable  but it  s the only little mistake  the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack  i  d like very much the lighting work on it  the best thing on it is a great  great actor  you know  if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance  but it  s only a great theater italian actor called toni servillo  yes  someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it  s too slow  it  s so boring  so many silences  but i think that this components its fantastic  its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl  the grand daughter of the italian actress anna magnani  olivia and the old mysterious man toni  one of my favorite italian films           if you only see one ernest movie in your life  make it this one  this is by far the best in the series  with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages  the other   ernest   flicks were good too  but most people tend to get tired of him quickly  not me  however    br    br   in this movie  ernest p  whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case  the murderer  nash  just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest  mr  nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him  and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer  br    br   a great flick  if you haven  t already seen it  watch it           an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful  so  no new story lines here  however  the authors managed to create a stupid  disgusting film  if you enjoy watching kids vomiting  or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife  s teeth out in a bloody horror type  go see  or rent  the film  if not  move on to something else  my fair lady  anyone            the first cube movie was an art movie  it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented  and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn  t understand  it was  on the non literal level  a   man vs  cruel nature   plot  where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end  triumphing to face a new  indefinable world beyond man  s petty squabbles  a world where there were no more struggle  but peace  i rated cube a    out of     and it  s a movie that was never meant to have any sequels  br    br   the second movie  hypercube was a massive disappointment  some of the ideas were kind of cool  but in the context of the original movie  both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning  still  for being fairly entertaining  i rated it a   out of     br    br   the third movie  cube zero  while ignoring the second  plays like a vastly inferior commercial b movie rehash of the first  sans the symbolism  there is no   homage   or   tribute   here  there is only ripping off  the same kind of plot  with some elements idiotically altered  like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes   an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say   br    br   that we see something from   behind the scenes   means nothing  because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment  the architects of which we hear nothing of  and  in this movie  those who get through to the exit  like kazan did at the end of the first movie  are just killed   where the  bleep  is the sense in that   that  s just flippin   stupid  i  m glad i didn  t pay to see this  br    br   the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad  but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of   out of              i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience  in other words   the creators planed to make comedy not drama  howsoever  at the end i realized that mr  tony giglio was earnest about this movie  it  s a pity because  the dialogue is ridiculous  the acting is poor and lifeless  the story is a fishy tale  poor ryan phillippe   despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance  what to say for jason statham   lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction    for this reasons i vote                i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully  me thinks he  the lady  doth protest too much  the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself  he sites profane literature  writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible  a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible  anyone can skew data   prove anything they like but it doesn  t make it true  customs change  word definitions change over time  look at english   german where it is very obviously a common root  nothing stays the same  it  s always growing and changing  the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i  ve found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research  in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics  these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped   the mean of the entire verse changes  writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces  without punctuation  without paragraphs   without numeric verses  these writings look like one long word   the translators added all of the above  for example how would you read this  godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here  same string of letters two entirely different meanings  this is why many biblical researchers use a   lexicon   to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic  greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written  it  s also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn  t exist  in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty  talk about ego  putting soapbox away  god bless maegi            i presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry      val br    br   mike nelson made me watch this   he mentioned it in his book    movie megacheese    i asked myself    why would mike nelson steer me wrong    i now know why the bots never trusted mike nelson  br    br   the music is by john williams  which is probably part of his payment to the devil  in fact  i  m sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol   slewfoot  or is now cursed  from the executive director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio  don  t watch   for the love of god   don  t watch    not even making a copy and showing someone else will un curse you   i  m doomed now  i understand this  i accept this  but save yourself             this movie was flippin awful    i wanted those hours of my life back  for god  s sake   stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs  its not worth mentioning the title  but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this  and where do i begin  the dumb a   kids in the movie     the zero plot or story    the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of towel slapping  or the very bad acted  teen angst innuendo           my god  it never ended      i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor  then sit through this one again  br    br   but what do you expect  most people with the brain power to look up reviews  are not going to be the target audience here at all  so go see pirites   again  or the jet lee one   if your debating to yourself  look  this movie will just cost you your soul  your money  your energy  and your brain cells  heed the warning           this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it  it has lot  s of laughs  guns  action  crime   good one liners  and a decent plot  with an over the top  donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain  tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too  thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character   max   a dea agent diane is the fbi agent  played by carerra  and john lithgow from frazier on tv  plays the bad guy     livingston    the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies  throw into the mix the assassain sutherland  who pretty much has all the good one liners  this is the perfect crime caper  there is the usual love story   but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith  you also have the russian mafia  italian mafia  and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix   the film is shot in boston   where you have some great shots   and locals   great photography and music in this film  this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy   it has everything that one could ever want  check out sutherland  s toilet in a particular scene   very unusual  this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard    plus for me           if you like to see animals being skinned alive  their heads smashed  dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them  then this one is for you  but if you are somewhat normal  and don  t need to see real footage of animal cruelty  pass this one up  this movie tries to shock the viewer  and it sure does with the animal snuff at the beginning  and the killing of babies in the movie  fake at least its was enough to make myself turn it off i  ve seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage  btk movie  and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie we watch gore and horror because we know its just make up  and special effects  so we shouldn  t sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals  its not what we rented the movie for if anything  there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won t be surprised by it  as a very hardcore horror fan  this one turned my stomach  the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked           another spanish movie about the      civil war  this time we  re told about the story of carol  lovely played by d  butant clara lago   a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york  it is such an initiating trip  and soon she  ll find about the injustices of the human race  their stupid fights and conflicts  their contradictions  br    br   imanol uribe makes his best film since   d  xadas contados          with such a sober pulse  a beautiful photography  and a nice script  he tries not to take part in the conflict  he just shows us some facts and let us decide  ok  the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in  and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple  clara lago and juan jos   ballesta  br    br   a well cared production  br    br   my rate                a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed  one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods  this is simply not true  prior to the construction of interstate     which bypasses the ocean view area  the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view  once the interstate was completed  ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime  this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park  which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg  meanwhile  in the past few years  the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought after location for construction of high end housing  br    br   it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film   rollercoaster    this is also untrue  footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film  but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to   death of ocean view park    br    br   as to the film itself  the storyline of a   supernatural   force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly  but somewhat typical for b grade movies of the time  with the cast involved  there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors  i don  t believe this film was intended to be another   citizen kane    i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into  apparently not    a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table  but proved unmanageable in execution  the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway    let  s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise     br    br   for the casual movie viewer  this would be a   see once and forget about it   film  except for diana canova fans   but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park  this movie is like a   walk down memory lane   for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk  the first   harborfest    and old dominion university  even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome           i was expecting a lot from mr amitabh bachan  s role of sarkar  but am disappointed  being a ram gopal verma  s direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie  sarkar is supposed to be a strong character  but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his  there is a movie in tamil called nayakan based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead  the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan  not his son  amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things  the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father           a trio of buddies  sergeants all in the british army  carouse   brawl their way across imperial india  intensely loyal to each other  they meet their greatest   most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult   its demented  implacable guru  now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment  the water carrier gunga din  to save scores of the queen  s soldiers from certain massacre  br    br   based more on the three musketeers than kipling  s classic poem  this is a wonderful adventure epic   a worthy entry in hollywood  s golden year of       filled with suspense   humor  while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum  it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the  sentimental  conclusion  br    br   it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars  cary grant  victor mclaglen   douglas fairbanks jr   as they are really all thirds of a single organism   inseparable and  to all intents   purposes  indistinguishable  however  this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time  br    br    it  s interesting to note  parenthetically  that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career  fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two   mostly in clandestine affairs   earning himself no fewer than   honorary knighthoods after the conflict  while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence  keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers   br    br   the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe  heartbreaking in the title role  he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity   enormous courage  making the last line of kipling  s poem ring true  he is unforgettable  br    br   montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major  whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru  the rest of the cast  joan fontaine  robert coote  lumsden hare  are effective but have little to do  movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine  s father  br    br   the film picks its villains well  the demonic thuggee cult  worshipers of the hideous  blood soaked kali  hindu goddess of destruction  was the bane of indian life for   centuries  ritualistically strangling up to        victims a year  in      the british military  in cooperation with a number of princely states  succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion  henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels   nightmares           this movie pretty much sucked  i  m in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible  if your in the military and you see this movie you  ll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad  it was ridiculous  they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do  it was a pretty gory movie i  d have to say the least  there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump  i  d recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent  gory movie  it will be a better movie also if your not in the military  i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one          if you watched pulp fiction don t see this movie  this movie is not funny  this is the worst parody movie ever  this is a poor attempt of parody films  br    br   the cast is bad  the film is bad  this is one of the worst pictures ever made  br    br   i do not recommend plump fiction  i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino  this is one of the worst parody films ever made  br    br   plump fiction is not a good movie  it is not funny  it is so dumb and vulgar          i went to see   passion of mind   because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances  i e    sliding doors      me  myself  i    etc   br    br   but this was the worst one i  ve ever seen  i had to force myself to sit through it  i didn  t even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me  br    br   the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two timing were guys who usually play villains  though each was kind of sexy and appealing  br    br   there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives  with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex  maybe the magic shouldn  t be explained for this genre to work  br    br    originally written                     i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies  i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted  to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot  the most suspense  surprises  most emotional  especially the ending  and definitely the most episodic movie  i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving  was not as episodic  and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie  br    br   it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole  i have heard many strange reasons such as  a  because yoda died b  because bobba fett died c  because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d  because darth vader was revealed br    br   i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely  first off  who cares if bobba fett died    if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die  don  t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas   intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be  his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie    you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett  s name    judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think    secondly  many fans did not like yoda dying  sure  it was a momentous period in the movie  i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic  all the good guys can  t stay alive in a realistic movie  you know  otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon  another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda  s death   well  nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope   many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy  why was obi wan  s death okay but yoda  s not    hmmmmmmmmmmmm     another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible  that is utterly ridiculous   i can not believe this one   first off  the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there  if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage   since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage  they had swinging vines  ropes  logs set up to trip those walkers  and other traps  the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest  the only thing they had was their blasters  to add  it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves  they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest  i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros  the band of rebels  as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain  that would have been a great upset  lastly  if this scene was still unbelievable to you   how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo  chewbacca  and the princess  being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view   and not only that  the heroes   of course  always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters  the troopers must have very  very bad aim then  at least in empire strikes back  the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not   heroes against a legion of stormtroopers  don  t believe me  check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando  s base  or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at  somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star  br    br   the last reason that i care to discuss  others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here   is that people did not like darth vader being revealed  well  in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie  luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father  annakin skywalker  it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father  s face because it made it complete  by annakin  s revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side  in his helmet  and to the good person he was annakin skywalker  by removing the helmet   the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about  in fact  that  s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke  s father   isn  t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet  br    br   on another note  i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse  even if it is better  that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves  i never go into a film with that deception in mind  i always try to go into a film with the attitude that   well  it might be better or worse that the original    but i can not know for sure   let  s see    that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was  br    br   i am not sure who criticizes these movies but  i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me  except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite  that it is rotj  i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading  br    br   bottom line  the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy  this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its     minutes  there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful  exciting  surprising  or all of the above  for example  the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day    br    br   finally  i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky  insignificant details  or see it as   just another sequel    to trash the movie such as   this movie stinks because luke is not in it    then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately  br    br             crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because  unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman  s agreement  which it beat to theatres by a few months  it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying   it  s because i  m jewish  isn  t it    it  s much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical  somewhat shamefully  the brief featurette on the warners   dvd doesn  t mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti semitic one  but it  s interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish  there  s little doubt in sam levene  s performance that the character is in fact also gay    not a mincing caricature  but there  s definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper  s confused soldier  there  s not much of a mystery to who the murderer is  even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows  the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable  but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point  the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy  br    br   there  s an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix  you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry   but the atmosphere is pure rko noir  set over one long sweltering night  the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style  it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors  and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script  a laid back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum  robert young  s maigret like detective  gloria grahame  s tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer  a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties  but the lasting impression is of robert ryan  s excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row  a big surprise hit in       as a reward  dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac  which itself had a notable tendency to target jews  so much for crusading            this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved  it  s always interesting to see the story from the   other   side for a change  this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad  russia  where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being fought  br    br   it  s interesting to see the other side of this battle  since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the   villains    in this movie those   villains   are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you  re fighting against  at first it  s kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german  s are the evil villains  but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care  and be interested in them  br    br   the way this story is told isn  t however the best  it  s hard to keep track of the story at times  as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other  the movie isn  t always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague  it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who  it doesn  t always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand  there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one  just not the most coherent one around  in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies  br    br   the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations  though the movie wasn  t even shot in russia itself  it helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere  br    br   the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic  but i don  t know  for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism  it also helps that they  re being played by well cast actors  all of the actors aren  t the best known actors around  thomas kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor  but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality  br    br   all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look  due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values  br    br                 so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert  s book   i hated  hated  hated this movie   and he gave this one a rare zero star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review   mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor    so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was  i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert  s review of rob reiner  s   north   where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review  here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don  t think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well  but above all the other things that were awful about this   movie   i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all  while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss  s girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits  but after that first   or   minutes the other    minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for    seconds then someone gets shot  then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill  haha  not funny  then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra  s   my way   sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss  of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die  are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny  i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny  not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss  who i admire much as an actor  for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that   independence day   was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history  did goldblum feel that   independence day   would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if   independence day   were a bomb  what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this  the opening sequence of   mad dog time   says that the movie is set on another planet  i only wish now that i have wasted    minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of    minutes out of my life that i will never get back  ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid  every copy of   mad dog time   should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire  i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it  s honor as the worst movie ever           what a boring film  to sum it all up  its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter in law karisma kapoor  while she tried to flee from the village  with her son  can someone say boring    the concept wasn  t too bad  but it was poorly executed  the canadian locales  and some of the village scenes were nicely shot  however  overall the cinematography came up short  the story could have been great  but the movie just seemed to drag on  there is only so much stupidity a person can take  let alone three bloody hours of it  br    br   the best part of the whole movie was the song   ishq kamina    and that was only five minutes long  other than that  this movie was a piece of crap            rant start  i didn  t want to believe them at first  but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill  after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie   gwoemul    aka   the host    of        which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b movie genre   successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic  even though their budgets  mainly spent on special effects  have become more and more fantastic  do south korean movie makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill  which their industry has built up since the      break out film   shiri swiri    by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did   rant end  br    br   the only   reason   i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean  east asian styled dragon i have seen to date  for the final scenes  now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the        dragonheart    the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons  remember   dungeons   dragons   in       hasn  t anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use  but how well you use it  i hope there are more  and better  korean legends they can use  because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one  br    br   in short  i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem   arirang   being played at the very end  as a creature feature  i would have given it at least   stars out of    if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it  but i  ve seen many video games with better camera work and scripting  just less dragons            as a native chinese  i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a   better world    i said   better world   because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years   br    br   i guess most western audience may don  t know qin shihuang means the first emperor   the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china  the tianxia chinese word was spoken by the king  means   the land and the people    spoken from his mouth is totally lie  from then on  one after another  all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said  br    br   another fact is  qin shihuang  s empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people  br    br   well  i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie  but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant           this had a great cast with big name stars like tyrone power  henry fonda  randolph scott  nancy kelly  henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles  it also had technicolor  one of the few movies made with it in       br    br   now the bad news       regrettably  i can  t say much positive for the story  it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light    and hollywood has done that ever since  why these criminals are always shown to be the   good guys   is beyond me  this film glamorizes them and made their enemies   the railroad people   into vicious human beings  the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous  well  that  s the film world for you  evil is good  good is bad  br    br   hey hollywood  here  s a news flash   the james boys were criminals  really   look it up           i remember watching this series avidly  every saturday evening  it was the highlight of the week  i loved everything about it  the location  the costumes  the actors and the wonderful music by clannad  i still have their legend album   i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin  this time the earl of huntingdon  i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times  another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors  i  m sure robin and his men would have young  after all people didn  t live that long in those days  other robins always look too old  kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin  s granddad   the only sad thing was the ending  it  s a shame they couldn  t at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending           i don  t normally write reviews  but this   film   was special  i couldn  t turn it off  i don  t believe i  ve ever seen a worse movie  but there i sat  watching  it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway  it was disgusting  but i couldn  t turn away  where do i start  the movie seems to think it  s a sports thriller  but it  s so utterly ridiculous  it can only be a comedy  but it  s not funny  not even in a dumb silly way  it  s like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get togethers  it  s painful to watch  but at least it  s only for a minute or two  second string went on for over an hour   br    br   whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again  the writing  directing  acting  and everything was just terrible  the problem is i can  t describe how bad it was  you just had to see it  and i  m sure this will never be shown again  so unless you saw it  you  re out of luck  i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other   bad   film i  ve seen over my lifetime  and for every film i see in the future that i can  t stand  i will think to myself  well  at least it wasn  t bad as the second string           few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability  br    br    no  too many are focused on john lassiter  s   amazing   ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius       but i digress   br    br   miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues  usually ecologically themed   and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance  still  miyazaki  almost  never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies  children  br    br   that said  i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability  where else are you going to have a film where a three year old  my nephew link  will sit still throughout the move  enthralled  a   year old  my niece amber  loving it all her own  and able to appreciate the   star power   of frankie jonas and noah cyrus  a    year old  my nephew aaron  who  s review was   of course it was good  everything miyazaki san does is good     a    year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation  er  that would be me   and a    year old woman  my mother  able to connect with the mother characters  and i  m betting the older charas too  and loving the   cuteness   of the child characters  br    br   and that is what i respect most about miyazaki san  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface    ponyo   could be seen as a simple story about a little fish girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske  somewhat like   the little mermaid     but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo  s mother  soske  s mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed  br    br   but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination   br    br   once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much  although maybe not as much as ham   soske is asked to be the man of the house  at age five  when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas  yes  he  s related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please   gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske  which is good since he has the most lines   his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly  characteristics you  re not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific  br    br   in the end  ponyo  s father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter  s decision and his estranges wife  s wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will   remember him fondly    and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical   bad guy    although miyazaki has  for some reason  received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a   bad person    all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters   br    br   and then there  s the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was hand drawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lip sync going on  quite unusual for an anime film   the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like  and what it should look like   br    br   in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki  s best  in my opinion  that honor is still held by kiki  s delivery service   but still a    star fun movie for the entire family           attractive marjorie farrah fawcett lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker  she is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address  as expected  joe james russo   the attacker forces his way into marjorie  s home and subjects her to humiliating terror  bruised and bloody  marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker  knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat  hog tied and battered himself  joe tries to explain himself to marjorie  s roommates diana scarwid and alfrie woodard  when they get home  there is almost a hint of mercy  but it is not coming from marjorie  should she continue to render her own punishment  violence  sexual abuse and rough language makes for an r rating  fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career  kudos to director robert m  young           i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it  people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance  i really hope norton did not do this  he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie  br    br   i found it entertaining  it wasn  t mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects  but it was not a bad  it was fun to watch  but yea  definitely not a bad horrible movie  br    br                 i watched this movie on tv last night  hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease  i was disappointed  and i think the movie was garbage  it did not seem real to me  some of the acting was awful  in particular that of the doctor  she was about the worst i  ve seen  the whole thing played like a cnn   worst case scenario    even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn  t seem sincere  i have seen some disaster movies  in particular those weather ones  which are actually so bad they are amusing  this one is almost as bad  but it is not even amusing  it is tedious and boring don  t bother with this one           for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings  who love film  have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny  smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you  br    br   for those with a poor attention span  high expectations and no brains   well   um   you may get bored and find things dragging at times  br    br   this is a charming  modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles  i chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through   br    br   this film is a little gem           the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in      and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most   movergoers   were stay at homes watching their new     motorola televisions  almost all recent box office figures are false     because they fail to adjust inflation  obviously today  s     movies will dominate  in      it cost   c to       at radio city    c to   c first run at loew  s palace in washington dc  or   c to   c in neighborhood runs  what counts is the number of people responding to the picture  not unadjusted box office   media spin    the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso  really not a great story anyway  and threw it in the trash  instead      of the movie  s focus was on the music  thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso  the result was a wonderful movie  too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating  too fat to play the student prince  edmund purdom took his place     with lanza  s voice dubbed in  and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising  if you want to see the great caruso  it  s almost always on ebay for       or less  don  t be put off by the low price  as it reflects only the easy availability of copies  not the quality of the movie           i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher  both have delivered less than memorable performances   films  while the underlying   general   storyline is somewhat familiar  this film was excellent  both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other  the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both  the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film  s most unforgettable emotional moment  the   specific   storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job   responsibility   to save lives at sea  the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and   wowing     i haven  t seen such angry seas since   the perfect storm    co star clancy brown  hbo  s   carnivale     great to see him again  played the captain of the coast guard  s kodiak  alaska base in a strong  convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins  the film wonderfully  and finally  gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard  it had the audience applauding at the end              i am not weapon expert  but even i can see difference between u s  army riffles in wwi and wwii  in movie we can see privates  armed with   m  garand    invented in year         not authentic        springfield    aka   silent death     who privates use until wwii  difference   m  can load     times more ammunition and   times more fire rate  m  was semi   automatic  springfield requires reloading after every shot  little difference      german army uniforms has borrowed from      year too  especially   helmets  german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top  we cannot see even one in movie  and if we make little additional search in archives   how much truthful is this   true story    i am surprised  how much   truthful   can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation           do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made  stop wondering  i  m telling you  michael is it  br    br   it is not   heartwarming      entertaining    or   travolta at his best    it just sucks  if i had kids  i would let them watch deep throat before michael  br    br   a sold out john travolta  a washed up and balding william hurt  and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film  br    br   but wait   you  ll get to hear andie mcdowell sing  yeah  hollywood really s  t all over us with this one           the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend  her aunt  edna may oliver  a person too talented for this film  didn  t like wheeler  a sentiment i can easily relate to  the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler  they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king  at about the same time  woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king  so when wheeler arrived  it was up to the boys to fight it out  but they refused because they are already friends  which greatly disappointed the people  as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime  br    br   i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood  the silent era through the     s  i have seen and reviewed hundreds  if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey  the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers  despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood  cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey   i can  t help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better  for example  there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother  s film  duck soup  yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp  at times  woolsey talked a bit like groucho  but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny  in fact  he just seemed to prattle pointlessly  his only funny quality was that he looked goofy  surely not enough reason to put him on film  additionally  wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese  a piece of cheese that sang very poorly  a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as   who  s on first   which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing  in fact  soon after they started their spiel  they just ended the routine  so prematurely that you are left frustrated  i knew that   who  s on first   had been around for many years and used by many teams  but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist  br    br   once again  i have found yet another sub par film by this duo  while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly  such as silly billies and the rainmakers  which i actually gave    s to on imdb   this one was a major endurance test to complete  something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey  where was all the humor            i was really hoping that this would be a funny show  given all the hype and the clever preview clips  and talk about hype  i even heard an interview with the show  s creator on the bbc world today   a show that is broadcast all over the world  br    br   unfortunately  this show doesn  t even come close to delivering  all of the jokes are obvious   the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame   and they are not given any new treatment or twist  all of the characters are one dimensional  the acting is   well   mediocre  i  m being nice   it  s the classic cbc recipe   one that always fails  br    br   if you  re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters  and if you  re white you  d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted  ignorant  or both  not that making fun of white people is a problem   most of the better comedies are rooted in that  it  s only a problem when it isn  t funny   as in this show  br    br   canada is bursting with funny people   so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis  so how come the producers of this show couldn  t find any           first of all   mexican werewolf in texas   is not a werewolf movie  this title is bullcrap  the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas  i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something  and i guess it actually works because that  s the reason why i bought this piece of crap  it sounded so stupid  anyway the movie isn  t any good  actually it  s bloody awful  but i didn  t expect anything else when i bought it  it  s a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster  if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog  actors and some gore then you should check into this movie  but i must warn you  this movie is really baaaaaaad  br    br   this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen  the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous  they almost never say a line in a normal way  they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say  it  s so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody  it  s like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it  the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo  she  s the worst of them all  i have never seen an actor as bad as her  and i  ve seen pteradactyl   even when her boyfriend dies she can  t stop being a bimbo about it  i hate her  br    br   some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good  the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project  but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark  the gore scenes are few and short  but really grizzly and violent  the effects are pretty hilarious really  but that  s the way i like it  the chupacabra looks pretty messed up  and it  s easy to see that it  s a guy in suit  br    br   overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it  s very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death  i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer           this movie is so god awful that it was literally a chore to watch  i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room  but kept thinking  foolishly  that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right    you lose  we win  yay    this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny  after that  beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks  and if you  re even considering renting this turd  or worse yet  have   i have one thing to ask of you  didn  t you even look at the cover  i mean  with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is    oy vey    this movie sucked           the symbolic use of objects  form editing  the position of characters in the scene    these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had  the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses  the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger    while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards  in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken  even the title has a least four meanings that i can see  the boxing ring  the wedding ring  the bracelet the lover buys  and the love triangle at the heart of the story           i found this movie to be very good in all areas  the acting was brilliant from all characters  especially ms stone and morissey  tramell  s character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute  the plot is interesting even though  this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels  the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller like masterpiece  go see this film now   it deserves better than what it got from the audience  which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie before it even started      you won  t regret it if you go see it             rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a   jollies   project for robert redford  as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine  br    br   the story is as light as powdered snow with redford  s small town boy david chappellet  what kind of lead name is that   who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory  gets up the nose of  in no particular order  his coach  father and team mates  women are a mere side show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of  heavens above  a free thinking  independent woman  played by camilla sparv  the ski ing sequences are fine with some good stunt work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day  plus i  m not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel  i couldn  t really be that excited for him one way or another  br    br   of the actors  redford  best profile forward  doesn  t need to do much and indeed doesn  t  while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material  ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he  s doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way  br    br   in truth though  there  s a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don  t fully compensate and you don  t care a fig for any of the leading characters  one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it           i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing  fun filled  thought provoking movie  the absence of sex  vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening  i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene  but that  s probably because i live a short distance from there  even so  this film could have been produced in any city  it  s the theme that  s so important here  i  m just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us  try it   you  ll like it           this is an art film that was either made in      or       the national film preservation foundation says      and imdb says        regardless of the exact date  the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period  with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late   s early   s  br    br   the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks  these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort  this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art  and like most performance art  it  s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome  the film  to put it even more bluntly  is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film  their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and   with it   to be understood by us mortals           i read the book and saw the movie  both excellent  the movie is diamond among coals during this era  liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw  this film should have made them stars  shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film  it could have easily been a franchise  release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film  look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed  no matter how late  watch it  you won  t be disappointed  do yourself another favor   read the book  same title   it  ll blow you away  times have changed dramatically since those days  or at least we like to think they have           a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town  leading to all kinds of complications  cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can  t escape the title town  hopper does what he does best  playing a psycho known as   lyle from dallas    the real hit man  walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast  the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns  and john  s direction creates a terrific   neo noir   atmosphere  witty and very entertaining  it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up           i really liked this movie  i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best  i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris  sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers  but not in this movie  it is definitely worth renting           although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast  ice cream  i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity  br    br   the plot opens with the dream of ali  a traveling ice cream salesman in a western anatolia town  in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies  he dreams of playing in his product  s tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis  dancing around him  as his dream turns into a nightmare  he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife  who rejects to make sex with him for   years with no apparent reason  is it because he is not successful in his job  apparently  because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies  but this is what he says  we actually don  t see him suffer that much  he still sells good  traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop  selling ice cream to the people in the town  ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real   sahlep    powdered roots of mountain orchids   ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor  and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect  his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business  they always quarrel  and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy  br    br   in a very successful day  his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town  in search of his stolen bike  ali goes to the police  blames the big companies for the theft  but  of course  nobody takes him seriously  annoyed by the nagging of his wife  ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk  one of his friends at his table  a wannabe socialist of the town  gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism  and with no real connection  jumps to the subject of global freezing  ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison  his wife wakes up and prevents him  an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life  according to him  ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing  when he returns home  suddenly we see that his wife understood his value  treating him like a hero and praising his manhood  meanwhile  the thief boys got sick eating too much ice cream  they confess to the doctor that they stole ali  s bike  ali forgives them and there comes the happy end  br    br   although the plot may look promising in a way  it  s the story telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy  first  the director doesn  t show much of an effort to tell the story visually  everything is based on dialogs  and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art  even ali  s troubles are not convincing because we don  t see it  we just understand it from his words  the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice cream companies  but there is nothing in the film about big companies  we don  t see their pressure enough  the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft  and when his motorbike is found  it solves every problem  ali becomes a happy and powerful husband  not a real criticism of globalism  br    br   second  the film is cheesy because of the crude humor  maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life  but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny  i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and   clever   but they are not clever jokes at all  they are just cheesy  maybe i  m wrong  maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor  but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars  or to have a political message  if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man  s big erection in his shorts  and we had to endure this joke twice   or an old villager woman saying   f  k you    then you may find this film funny           stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history  and deservedly so  so i am happy to see any of their films  ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital  and with nothing else to do  stan decides to visit him  and take him some boiled eggs and nuts  instead of candy  chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie  s leg cast string  and manages to push the doctor  billy gilbert  out the window  clinging on to it  getting ollie strung up to the ceiling  when the situation calms down  stan gets ollie  s clothes  as the doctor wants them both to leave  and he also manages to sit on a syringe  accidentally left by the nurse  filled with a sleeping drug  which comes into effect while he is driving  which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen  filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad  although repetitive and a little predictable  classic comedy  it isn  t great  but it  s a black and white film worth looking at  stan laurel and oliver hardy were number   on the comedians   comedian  okay           ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings  this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door  compared to datd the effects are vastly superior  however the plot is weak  the acting reminiscent of everyone  s favourite  the porn film  and the decisions and actions of the   characters   consistently verge on the moronic  i feel like trying out uwe boll  s latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd   i am not suggesting that he is really the cure  more a case of a different disease  but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up  ok there it is  i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead             i was  unlike most of the reviewers  not born in the     s  i was born on may   th       despite this  my life was very much in the style of the     s  when other kids had playstations  i was playing zelda on my nes etc  now  this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only    years old at the time of writing this review  i  because of my     s style early childhood  watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn  t see  and this movie was one of those  and one of the greatest too  br    br   it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville  simon seville  theodore seville and david seville  david  the chipmunk  s adoptive father  is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe  his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack  while they are talking  alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world  even though  technically dave is only going to europe  so to alvin  apparently only america and europe qualify as     the world       david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller  much to the displeasure of the boys  soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller  later  at a local caf   the chipmunks are playing a game of     around the world in    days     against the chipettes brittany  jeanette and eleanore   after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile  alvin get  s in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world  two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table  klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and  needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world  decide to fool the children into delivering them for them  they set up a race around the world  where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness  secretely filled with diamonds  at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team  s likeness  secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds  to     varify that they were there      the winning team would then receive a         dollar reward  they do this because they believe that jamal  an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now  would never suspect them because they are just kids  however  this seems to be redundant  because on their travels  the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls  i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally   and so begins a great adventure  this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it  it features great animation and top notch voice acting  not to mention the kick ass music  pardon my french  p   my favorite song is without a shred of doubt     the girls and boys of rock and roll     an amazing rock song that cannot be topped  it  s also my favorite moment in the film  other notable songs include     getting lucky     kind of suggestive for a kid  s film eh   and     my mother     as well as     wooly bully     and     off to see the world     not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra  the scene with     my mother     still brings a tear to my eye  in relation to the song     getting lucky     i first didn  t think anything of it  but when i grew older and learned about life  it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive  that song  along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties  this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince  s men  when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely  while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film  it  s one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are   feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child  anyway  a bit after that scene  the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home  the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband  ross bagdasarian jr  know the characters better than anyone  they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes  ross doing the voices for alvin and simon  as well as dave  and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore  speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses  nancy cartwright  the voice of bart simpson  makes an appearance in this movie  she plays the part of the arabian prince  a very small  but important role  the ending is of course  a happy one  the crooks have been caught  the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children  dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset  alvin complaining about not having gotten his         dollar reward for winning the race  which annoys dave until he finally yells     alvin      and the screen fades to black br    br   classic ending  by the way  i hope you found my review of this movie useful  and if you haven  t seen this flick  give it a watch  it  s worth the money  this nostalgic classic from the     s gets a solid    out of      br    br       headin   for the top  don  t you know  we never stop believing now              just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a   bomb   rating  a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night  i feared the worst knowing its reputation  and it was as god awful as i  d anticipated  this is a mexican made mess  dubbed into english  and produced by k  gordon murray  it  s got terrible sets and effects  and features a rather frightening santa who doesn  t operate at the north pole  but instead from a cloud in outer space  and who doesn  t have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is  the opening sequence  where st  nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages  seems to go on forever  and with no story  obviously  this santa claus doesn  t observe the child labor laws  br    br   eventually we get some nasty and slinky red suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth  just to make little kids naughty and turn santa  s christmas eve rounds into a nightmare  watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience  and it  s bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever  oddly  the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film  which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on  this easily makes my personal list of the   worst movie i  ve ever seen    but i  m sure that  s nothing unique           as is often the case when you attempt to take a     plus page book and cram it into a two hour film  a lot is lost  here director john madden  shakespeare in love  takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off  what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete  br    br   there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic  the cinematography by john toll  cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall  winning oscars for both  is splendid  working with madden  the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful  madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople  giving the town an authentic feel  the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous  br    br   madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance  which take up the greater part of the film  there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment  however  by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold  there isn  t much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated  while the battle scenes are well done  subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long  by the time we reach the post war scenes  the treatment is merely skeletal  another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features  br    br   nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight  when fight he must  cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas  br    br   penelope cruz  whom the camera loves  gives an uninspired performance as pelagia  in part this is because cage so dominates the screen  but cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic  she allows the character to be objectified as corelli  s love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right  br    br   john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor  who knows as much about human nature as medicine  however  christian bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as pelagia  s fianc    br    br   i rated this film an       despite some drawbacks  this is a touching film that is well worth seeing  the photography alone is worth the price of admission           my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie  passing them down in the family if you will   and i loved it  br    br   clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it  s up to superman to stop this mayhem  br    br   it  s just so wonderful and fun to view  the old style special effects and sound   the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology  george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid  and i  m    now  it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are          this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic  much much better than     of the scream rip offs out there  i even hope they come up with a sequel          i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan  a culture i know very little about  i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint  i watched this with someone who didn  t read the book and he also enjoyed it  they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film  it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over  you feel for the characters and their plights  i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture  there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch  it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime           years ago  sara  a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered  now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments  did i mention she has an imaginary friend   this film lulls the viewer  not into a sense of tension  mind you  but rather a sense of sleepiness  deathly boring  i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed   mystery    is sara going crazy  or is it the paranormal  a better question would be  who cares  and the answer to that  no one  no one at all  skip this film  save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks  br    br   my grade  d           in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included  if you don  t like burt you may still like this  if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time  being from atlanta it does hit home but it  s also nice to see a cop action drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city  chicago  miami  or la  the film is funny at points with   good plot   good performances from a great supporting cast  every character is real   the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out a nice offbeat romance in the  nd half   it has some good old fashion shootouts   fistfights  no cgi thank god real action   br    br   if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with   every which way but loose       any which way you can   then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this    it comes off great           i have watched love jones over thirty times  it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be african americans  the dialogue was realistically written  and delivered with honesty  it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional african americans  this is virtually an untapped market  love jones was visually captivating as well  the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love  the feeling of the film is jazz and blues  and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and butterscotch  if you hadn  t guessed  i loved it           the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage a trois  fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this  using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists  invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience  br    br   it  s really rather messy though  fellowes doesn  t seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat edged  rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves  br    br   the dialogue is inconsistent  stagey here  vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich   landmine  though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can  t create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces  there  s also a very prosaic  dare i say it british feel to the filming  i didn  t want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation  i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story  br    br   finally it is  in fact  the story which lets the rest down  just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes  woven as a vehicle for character examination  wilkinson and watson support this meta essay with good performances and john warnaby  s ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow furrowing  br    br   i  m disappointed  not that it  s bad  but that it could have been much better                this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched  at the age of    i was up late and ran across the movie  it was on the usa channel  gilbert godfrey  s up all night  i will never forget  at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues  some sexual  you know    is a very rough and weird age  it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl  and being a young lady  this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me  i now have a daughter that is     have been searching for a couple years for this movie  if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy  would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age           holes is an awesome movie  i love it a lot and it  s one of my favorite films  it  s one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn  t cheesy  holes is generally a very cool motion picture  i wish disney would make more pictures like it  holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool  don  t get the wrong idea  i don  t mean to bad mouth disney but most of it  s stuff is aimed towards kids and that  s okay  children deserve to have their entertainment too  but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail  but not with holes  it  s the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it  s corny  really  it  s the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to  br    br   holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge  i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this           i cannot hate on the show  when the old  and better  tech tv had to hit the bricks  the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in    attack of the show   is the replacement for the screen savers  with   co hosts in the beginning  they were kevin rose  kevin pereira and sarah lane  brendan moran came to be something of a co host as well  but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show  kevin rose decided to leave the show  and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host  but that didn  t pan out for some reason  br    br   eventually  i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard  sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because  hey  this is what i read  the two got married  that was a big secret to me  now there is a new female co host  the not as hot  my opinion  olivia munn  she  s hiding something in those tops she wears  while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn  t afraid to show it  br    br   ahem  sorry  br    br     attack of the show   deals with everything young people want to know about  it  s music  movies  comic books  the internet and television  this is what  s great about the show  if you don  t want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv  you can get all you want on aots  some segments and bits they do are funny  they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry  as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names  br    br   even though the hosts aren  t as geek as i  d like them to be  i still have found   attack of the show   to be entertaining  even with its latest lineup           worst dcom i have seen  ever  well  maybe not as bad as smart house  this was just bad  the acting and story was fine  but the effects sucked  br    br   they were so fake  the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen  that was probably the only scene in which i was excited  br    br   overall  i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly   br    br   i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene  br    br                 its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest nonsenses in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people                      a movie which has no story again shahrukh khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start scrambling his head for thousands of times i think this is to much pretty zinta spouse to act the character of a pakistani girl i didn  t know that there is enough facilities in pakistan for the pakistani girls to do so many plastic surgeries on their face and also there are enough make up facilities     and also i didn  t know that an indian can cross the march  s between both countries go to pakistan and start dancing and singing may be pakistani soldier  s were sleeping                   some people may call   cooley high   the same sort of thing as   american graffiti    but i wouldn  t  for starters  in   ag    everyone was white  whereas in   ch   they  re all black  moreover  this one has a motown soundtrack  specifically  the movie focuses on several working class african american students in      chicago and their antics  the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships  in their apartments  we see that there  s never any dad around  but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest  br    br   one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible  worrying about missing school  two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene  and the one white guy in the movie  but overall  the main star is the soundtrack  it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history  we even have it on vinyl here at home   a classic in the real sense of the word           so wonderful  so quirky  so romantic  so italian  the film is so feather  light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again  a kitchen sink world of bakeries  and hairdressers  and plumbing  but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence  should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction  take your pick    they  re both faultless  let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass           this film is  quite simply  brilliant  the cinematography is good  the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking  this is the story of donald woods  a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid  kevin kline is completely convincing   so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later  i recognised him from kline  s portrayal  denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance  as ever  br    br   i urge you to watch this  it is long  but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story  remember  folks  this really happened           i have recently seen this production on dvd  it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in      and it was just as good as i remembered  at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then   i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then  but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been  i am a bit of a   jane eyre   purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one  i have recently re read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on  reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly   br    br   all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way  some even leave out the   rivers   family and their connection to jane altogether  i also think this is the only production to include the   gypsy   scene done correctly  br    br   the casting is perfect  zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book   small plain and dark   and i disagree that she looked too old  timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester  portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off  i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time  like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted  his expression is fantastically frightening  but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another  a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable  oh to be loved by a man like that  there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however  like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things  i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks   br    br   finally if you never see another production of jane eyre   you simply most see this one it is simply perfection           in a time of bad  if not plain awful  comedies  king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air  it  s a complete oxygen tank  it is in my opinion one of the   best comedy shows of all times  nothing has been this good since married with children  kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses  and believe me  it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius  these guys truly understand what is funny  i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn  t get half the laughs from seeing koq just once  other funny people in this show are carrie  janet heffernan  spence and doug pruzan  carrie  s boss   i  m so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem  the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers  check it out if you haven  t            prey  br    br   aspect ratio         br    br   sound format  mono br    br   a lesbian couple  sally faulkner and glory annan  living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man  barry stokes  who turns out to be a flesh eating alien  the vanguard of a massive invasion    br    br   despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing  norman j  warren  s follow up to satan  s slave        amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts  thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff  apparently  his only writing credit   faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside  rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v  browne  s eye catching cinematography   though annan  s discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one  or both  of these doe eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed  which may explain the absence of their respective families  some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and   left   under mysterious circumstances  stokes   unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray  partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him  creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence  there  s an extraordinary  multi layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to   emasculate   their clueless visitor by dressing him in women  s clothing  though stokes   alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery  br    br   in the early scenes  at least  the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity  but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude  culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner  the closing sequences are  quite literally  gut wrenching  especially annan  s final scene  which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in      and never fully restored  what remains is still pretty vivid  so brace yourselves    excellent performances by the three leads  bolstered by warren  s unobtrusive direction  which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations  thereby compensating for the film  s budgetary shortcomings  originally released in the us as alien prey           the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland  winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants  both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead  michael gaffikin  james warwick  a former paratrooper in the british army  is the local dentist  he  s not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson  celia imrie  is always being viewed with a little suspicion  not maliciously  but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin  the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman  he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip maurice ro  ves  at the islands police station  inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp  dr goudry  for closer inspection  a quick search for the killer proves fruitless  as does a search for a missing local woman  over dinner that night with michael gaffikin  fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson  a woman from the mainland  who lives on the island through the winter months  a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body  her home proving to be the murder scene  but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods  suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island  one colonel howard  jonathan newth who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together  br    br   goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body  it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength  one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer  another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind  a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain  with a heavy fog rolling in  the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help  the radio also doesn  t work  seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut  reports of ufo  s and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach  inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin  s idea that aliens might be involved  but a rise in radioactive levels on the island  has him doubting himself  br    br   the nightmare man is based on the novel  child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire  it is here adapted by dr who and blake  s   scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board  the nightmare man though is on the whole  a succinctly better crafted piece  that builds its plot alongside solid character development  even down to the minor characters  time is given to giving them all a firm background  the island setting is perhaps a genre clich   that has been used over and over  but its one that i enjoy very much  the remoteness  the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts  in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama  but credit to camfield  he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times  there is an authenticity about proceedings  the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point  if there is one negative about the killer its that  we are given his her its pov for the killings  an acceptable clich   on its own  but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens  it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little  still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer  given the clues presented  but it  s a fun and very well acted piece  the local scottish cast are exceptional  the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold  imrie  never one i  ve taken to in other works  is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production  the outlandish  maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers  it disappointed me in some ways  but taking into account when it was made  its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it  is even more terrifying           this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie    so if you haven  t seen either movie and want to but don  t want the spoilers  please don  t read this review  br    br   while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time  the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions  the actors that they had portray ryan phillippe  s christian and sarah michelle gellar  s kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed  neither can pull off the smarmy  snooty rich kid attitude that the original actors did  it  s absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim    not so much between christian and kathryn  but if you listen closely enough you  ll recognize it  there are also inconsistencies in the plot   if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn  then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie  he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie  with reese witherspoon  s character   br    br   also  the tie in with the photography   you could be a model   comment at the end was totally lame and didn  t add anything at all  overall  this movie was a waste of time  i can  t believe they made a cruel intentions             this movie is ridiculous  it  s attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible  the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it  s a comedy  truly is bad cinematography  you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there  s a few jokes here and there going on but either way they  re all inside jokes amongst themselves  this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad  it really is a very pointless movie their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway  unless you want to be bored out of your ass  i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie           in dramatising wilde  s novel  john osborne has condensed events  eliminated a number of characters  and generally implied rather than shown dorian  s essential wickedness  if you want a more explicit rendering  see the      film  wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame  but were certainly vastly different men and writers  this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson  s   dr  jekyll and mr  hyde    but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy  whereas rls took the scientific route  both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil  with evil winning in the end  br    br   the actors in this bbc movie  take a different route  too  from those in the      film  john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders  in his role really projecting wilde himself  but with a subtle difference  you  ll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying  but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes  peter firth  too  shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion  but then we don  t get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display  br    br   it  s a very good production  with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel  if not all of its ramifications           it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids  bully  etc  but then just as quickly  it unravels into a direction less mess  who is the main character  is this a serious film or some gregg araki esquire over the top goofy film  is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted  i have no clue  i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end  i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came  i cut a good    minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes  yes  it illustrates the changing landscape between the have  s have not  s  i got it way back in the beginning  kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends  wassup felt very staged  poorly constructed and ever worse acting  teenage caveman  which larry didn  t write but did direct  was terrible  but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn  t take itself seriously  wassup rockers was just plain bad           this is my first deepa mehta film  i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its   sita   character presented as nita  i also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita sita  yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta  not her direction  the characters  big and small  were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end  somewhat like the end of mazursky  s   an unmarried woman    they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men  and one cardboard man  ashok  seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him   carrying his invalid mother biji  he seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion   br    br   ms mehta seems to fumble as a director  however  compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant  as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese micro minority in the social milieu of india  she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter  not her father   yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field  compare her to mrinal sen  adoor gopalakrishnan  muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giants  given her competent canadian production team and financial resources  mehta  s film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle class household may be sacrilege to some  but merely captures the atrophy of middle class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space  kannada  malayalam  and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers  br    br   ms das  ms azmi  mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding  ms azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors  mrinal sen  s   khandar    gautam ghose  s   paar    benegal  s   ankur    a brilliance notably absent in this film  ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability  all in all  the film  s strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema  i am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays           all the way though i was thinking to myself   oh god why    at the very beginning i thought   right it might be average    but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious  br    br   every part in it was so predictable  even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring  it was a half decent movie  but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible  some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves  eg  the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches  my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next  and more times than less i was right  br    br   why does going into the house make her come after you  it doesn  t make sense  it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings  and no really depth was seen at all  br    br   you can see everything coming  which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching  oh shes behind her     didn  t see that one coming  yawns   br    br   surely these people must have thought to    oh i don  t know  carry a knife round or at least try and fight back  instead of being eaten but someone hair  at best during the movie i was very mildly scared  and i mean mildly   i was just crying out for the credits  as they rolled i exhaled a short   oh thank god    if you haven  t already  don  t waste your   time and money on this  pointless  plot less  sorry excuse for a sequel           at       a high school student commits suicide  not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known  time skips back to the start of the day  from here we follow six separate students  marcus  melody  luke  steven  sarah and sean  each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas  all reaching boiling point  hitting to an end for one  br    br   after losing a friend to suicide  and surviving his own suicide attempt  writer director murali k  thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide  suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows       is thalluri  s attempt to bring it to light  if you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has       becomes all the harder to view  br    br   with heavy and hard subject matter  thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis  s  sex  pregnancy  sexual identity  bullying  friendship  thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner  the factor on thalluri  s talent is his subtlety  he respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime  it verges near documentary at times  it has such a painful realism  the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this  br    br        has a distinctive similarity to gus van sants film elephant  while the core of each film is different  both tackle teen life  like sant  thalluri utilizes long tracking shots  with time skipping back and forth  to show each characters interaction from different perspectives  a defining point to elephant was its ethereal ambiance  with spare conversation  little development of characters  and the long tracking shots  sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread  while there resides this dread in       the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level sant couldn  t reach  as time goes by  each characters fragility creeps out  dragging you along their emotional roller coaster  br    br   the real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide  foretold at the very beginning  the hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion  though many films that have shown suicide  gloss over the act or romanticizes the act  thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution  with unknowns in the leads and their first major roles  teresa palmereach  frank sweet  joel mackenzie  marni spillane  charles baird and sam harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers  br    br   compelling and revetting       is an absolutely unmissable film           the quote above just about says it all for   slipstream    i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour  but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance  i won  t watch it again  so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clich  d lines in the movie  i  m sure it will set a record  br    br   some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker  mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry  paxton  s character has hijacked hamill  s prisoner  an android taking his name from the poet byron  bob peck   tasker  hamill  shoots owens  paxton  with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski  kitty aldridge  can keep tabs on the pair  the real question though is why didn  t he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middleman  br    br   if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense  then i suppose you  ll find something of interest here  but you can  t convince me that the film makes sense on any level  scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery  but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton  s character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso  if anyone thinks there  s some hidden meaning here  you  re really stretching  br    br   patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming   the end   to come into view  alas  even that was denied  if beauty is in the eye of the beholder  then so is understanding  this movie had neither  yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run   an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons  apparently the film was keeping them afloat           director edward sedgwick  an old hand at visual comedy  successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fast moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting  employing a large number of roach  s reliable performers  although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly  sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins  a young kansan who sells his auto repair business and journeys to hollywood  where he attempts to wangle a screen role for the girl he loves  star struck cecilia  rosina lawrence   sedgwick  who prefers using the entire m g m studio as his set  does so here as cecilia  always ready for an audition  is treated by a would be paramour  cinema star rinaldo lopez  mischa auer   to behind the scenes action of  naturally  a musical comedy  featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti  laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interludes  including their well known skit involving a tiny harmonica  and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton  russell hicks and walter long  on balance  one must hand the bays to mischa auer  who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star  a role which he largely creates  and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley  s filmic spectacles           the jokes are obvious  the gags are corny  and the characters are walking characatures   but i couldn  t stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie  no matter how many times i see it  i still get a kick out of this one  and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment  it contains many quotable moments  and some of the best sight gags i  ve seen to this day  if you  ve had a bad week and you need a chuckle  rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start           these slasher pics are past their sell by date  but this one is good fun  br    br   the valentine cards themselves are witty  and well thought out  br    br   the film has one peach of a line      he  s no angel       when he in fact is angel    watching buffy reruns will never be the same  br    br   the cast is a sizzling display of young talent  but the story does not give them enough real depth  denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters  sorry but no  br    br   the direction is very good  managing to show very little actual gore  and relying on your imaginations implied threat  much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes       br    br   essentially  the main directorial plus  lies within the   borrowing   of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks  psycho  s shower scene is tributed  along with halloween  s   masking     br    br   murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know    br    br   light viewing  not very scary but a few good jump moments  if it was a choice between the hole and this though  choose the hole  slasher movies have had their day  and this is just another slasher  a very good slasher  but nothing groundbreaking             the only reason i gave this episode of   masters of horror   a   instead of a   is because the two lead actors are good  and it wasn  t shot on vhs  the story  the dialog  and the plot are ridiculous   br    br   talking   driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war  give me a break  what next  zombies who come back to go skydiving  maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows   br    br   i never supported the iraq war  but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces  and   homecoming   was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war   br    br   with zombies being mass produced in today  s market    this is the spam of zombie related entertainment  how   homecoming   made it onto   masters of horror   is beyond me           like most  i thought   another crocodile movie    so far we  ve had primeval and rogue in the last    months  what can they do that  s new  where both those films were about action and violence  this one  s about fear and tension  br    br   the performances aren  t oscar worthy when there  s nothing going on  but in times of distress or terror  these people suffer so much it  s like torture  there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don  t really behave like this as others have pointed out  but the fear is so effective it  s a stretch to say you  ll enjoy this movie  it  ll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ           there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick  s abundance of clich  s throughout    and i agree completely  both with regard to the characters and the dialog  br    br   i  d read about elizabeth berkly  s awful performance in the equally awful   showgirls    which i  ve never seen   and her performance here  while not awful  is barely up to the standards of lifetime  s worse fare  there was not a hint of depth to her character  but then there probably shouldn  t have been  if so  it would have placed the film completely out of balance  since there wasn  t a hint of depth or charisma   not a trace   in any one character  performer  or portrayal  br    br   the principal  s handling of liz  s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable  her husband  s initial reaction and advice were likewise  forrest gump  attacking jenny  s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic  intelligent action  and  hell  he was mentally challenged   br    br   the smarmy  unctuous lawyer  excuse the redundancy  father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance  he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time  no mean feat  her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd  also not unknown in the profession  br    br   finally  and frankly  i rather enjoyed this part   the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs  that you  d rather depend upon barney fife  without andy  to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community  i know that most real like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness  intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the   law and order   series    and the like    but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on   lifetime    br    br   finally  i found a kind of   story within a story   fascination with josh  s concoction of his being the   victim   of his teacher  this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story  this was something of an achievement  like going from   f   to   f minus    br    br   this whole lame situation should have been resolved   in real life   in about    minutes  following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities  with husband involved  but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following  and left an hour  s blank film in the camera   br    br   but the writer s  here  proved with their ending  they could do even worse  when the situation was finally   resolved   and   righted    this was accomplished in all of about    seconds  with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any   real world   context for the perpetrator and his parents  or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption  br    br   this one  s a    presentation  the second       because it does have some mild   fascination             if you haven  t seen this yet  you really should  on dvd  i can  t believe how much i enjoyed it  it is amazingly realistic and believable  true  much of it is speculated  and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts  there aren  t many of them   but it handles everything quite well with a   cruel mother nature   theme  it will remind you of the nature programs that you  ve seen on animal planet and the discovery channel  only the animals here are dinosaurs  they act natural  they eat  kill  mate  play  and fight for survival  you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others  br    br   for the most part  the effects are excellent  at times they will look a little too much like cgi  s  but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic  in some cases  you will actually be convinced that you  ve seen a dinosaur  my favorites were the coelophysis  the raptors  the diplodocus  the iguanadons  the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds  i was most disappointed with the t rex  however  which looked a little too computer generated at times  br    br   in any case  you should definitely see this production  it is educational  well made  and very entertaining  for what it is  its an a           why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre  other then action  i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck  i just could not change the channel  it  s sheer stupidity sapped my willpower  its pretty telling that the cast imdb   credits   with this monstrosity apparently never worked again  br    br   bad acting  bad writing  bad narration  bad music  bad hair  bad cinematography  it just goes on and on  the movie really has nothing to recommend it  if you  re looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out  there are a tonne of other films that won  t require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards  br    br   i hope this film didn  t get money from the government for financing  otherwise i  m never paying taxes again           ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai  india  sadhu agashe is a hard working  hard edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison  his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers  imtiaz  becomes frustrated by sadhu  s high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status  a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case  further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu  s tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics  br    br   i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india  the camera work is excellent  the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds  the acting  pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood  sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director  shimit amin  has taken liberties with factual accounts  nevertheless  ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film making           let  s keep it simple  my two kids were glued to this movie  it has its flaws from an adult perspective  but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy it   br    br   and the pepsi girl was excellent  br    br   and kimberly williams was pretty gosh darned hot  although she  s not in the film very much  so don  t get too excited there  br    br   not that  s it  s really a bad thing  but it is the kind of movie you watch just once  don  t buy the dvd  br    br   enjoy  br    br   did i mention kimberly williams   that was for the dads            it was   a m  in the morning and i had nothing else to do  don  t judge me    please  br    br   we  re back in time during the spanish settlements  a group have made their way onto an island  it doesn  t take too long before they encounter a large   reptile    which gobbles up their horse  soon they  re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the   reptile gods    the cg sucks  it reminds me of the cg of early console video games  the encounters were lame  the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit  otherwise it  s just a middling effort           lackawanna blues is and excellent movie  the casting was perfect  every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played  their chemistry together was amazing  the acting was superb  i felt as if i knew the characters  i could almost   feel   them  they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the     s and     s  oh  the memories   my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see  i have watched this movie so many times  that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them  i can  t even list my favorite part  because i have so many favorite parts  thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age   and that is black people loving each other  looking out for each other  respecting each other  caring about each other  and doing all we can to help each other  gotta go now  i have to go watch it again           saturday june        pm the neptune br    br   monday june        pm the neptune br    br   few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura  s brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz   masterpiece iberia suite  at the approach of its centennial  saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland  the twelve   impressions   of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings  allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura  s camera  creative use of large flats and mirrors  moved throughout the set  combined with screens  shadows  fire  rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song  dance and instrumental performance  photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program  connecting the passion of the music to its great creator  saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors           as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clich  d movies that hollywood makes  there seems to be no creativity in hollywood  companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in  br    br   this movie is a welcome change  it could be classified as romantic comedy for it  s genre but don  t let that turn you off this movie  this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces  br    br   if you are reading this  you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that  the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are   interstate      and   art of travel   which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage  br    br   this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same  br    br   dean          many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow  although the story line was rather typical of clara  s later silents  i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun  clara plays a happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves   never mind that this man is married  clara  s lack of modesty was shocking in the day  but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie  though definitely not a brilliant story line  quite typical  actually   this movie is a nice showcase of clara  s ability to make the audience laugh           as the number of video nasties i  ve yet to see dwindles  this little pile of garbage popped up on my   to rent   list when i saw it was available  br    br   the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots  some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip  though if he returns with the girl and all the money  he gets a significant cut  he  s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and  wow  that pilot is one of the worst actors ever  granted  they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood  after stealing away into the jungle  we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour  now  this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever  ping pong balls for eyes and that  s pretty much it  his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack  and i found myself muting much of those scenes  br    br   oh  did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity  this is probably the main reason this film was banned  though there is one specific scene  about one second long  where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out  but it  s not a redeeming factor for gore fans  also  jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals  and  sadly  male as well  so  if you want   fair   in terms of exploitation  you got it  br    br   i can  t recommend this trash to anyone  it  s not even the good bad movie  it  s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then  if you are making your way through the list  leave this for the very last  if you watch it first  you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list  which is certainly not true           i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case  judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun  but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on  david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent  judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a   should have gave it a    i gave it an extra star just because david keith  s gun was cool           i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it  game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film  he failed thank god  br    br   the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won  t like her because she  s ugly  the film is just bad for so many reasons  the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits  ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit  those two scenes made me cringe  janeane  s character is sickeningly arrogant  and guessing from her role as stand up   comedienne   and arch feminist is in real life too   she claims that the film is   anti feminist   when in fact it  s just realistic  men more often than not go for looks over personality  it  s interesting to note her hypocrisy too  she  d been a feminist and   comedienne   for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad  i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film  i mean come on  she acted in it for heaven  s sake  what this film was really was anti men if anything  it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman  s character noelle  br    br   there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin  s character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure  is that the best the script writers could come up with  blimey they  ve never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made  there  s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is  the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn  t ugly but is actually beautiful  erm was i watching the same film as they were  she  s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one  although having said that  i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well  she  s lanky and gaunt looking  br    br   i guarantee three things about this film if you  ve never watched it  br    br   you will know what the ending will be  br    br   you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and  br    br   you will be bored after ten minutes  br    br   watch at your own peril          this movie has everything typical horror movies lack  although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers  the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for jackzilla  dare i say oscar winner  this is a perfect date movie  i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person          having just seen walt disney  s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube  i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub iwerks  the colors  compared to the earlier black and white  are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one  s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short  it does get a little repetitious near the end  still  skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony           the cast of this film contain some of new zealander  s better actors  many of who i have seen in fabulous roles  this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them  the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong  as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry  decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot  most of the cast appear to be from the  great  long running new zealand soap shortland street  it  s as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party  the result of too many gins  and possibly a bit of salmonella  imagine   under siege   meets   the love boat    staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea  br    br   if you are an actor  i recommend you see this film  as a study on how to destroy your carer           emily watson and tom wilkinson together   what a treat  with rupert everett and linda bassett rounding off the

           i am amazed with some of the reviews of this film  the only place that seems to tell the truth is rottentomatoes com  this film is awful  the plot is extremely lazy  it is not scary either  people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle geller it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it  this film is more like dark water  except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it  i was extremely disappointed with this film  it didn  t scare me nor interest me either  let  s face it   this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e g  the dead trying to contact the living   dragonfly  what lies beneath  ghost story  dark water  darkness  the changeling etc etc  it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the koreans  the films that are coming out of hollywood  like this  are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer  they  re just being churned out          angela  sandra bullock  is a computer expert but  being shy and somewhat of a recluse  she does all of her work from the confines of her condo  just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico  a co worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it  angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash  angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her  while she is sunning on the beach  a terrific looking gentleman named jack  jeremy northam  makes overtures to her  she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel  however  jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it  even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa  jack makes things difficult  he changes angela  s identity on every computer across the nation  making her lose her condo  her bank account  everything  can angela  a computer whiz  beat jack at his own game  this very exciting movie has many assets  first  bullock and northam are two very beautiful  interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation  the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today  s world  the costumes  sets  production  and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful  and  despite how it sounds  there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy  if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence  this is a great choice  it delivers twists and turns with great frequency  making it possible for the viewer to   net   a very good evening of entertainment           i rented the dvd in a video store  as an alternative to reading the report  but it  s pretty much just more terror tainment  br    br   while the film may present some info from the report in the drama  you  re taking the word of the producers   there  s no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film  not one  br    br   the acting  all around  is pretty bad   pretty much all of the stereotypes of   hot shot   bitchy foul mouthed government agents  each thinking they know more than everyone else  there may be some truth to it  but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it  br    br   imdb  s user community ratings   comments tend to be more right than wrong  and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can  br    br   i wish i had on this one           look  this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies  but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie  she is smokin   hot and a great little actress to boot  these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson  nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film  my friends bob  bill and dennis agree   lisa is not only brilliant  she is a hottie  the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard  but as soon as lisa hits the screen  things really start hopping  the others are clearly not in her league  this is not the exorcist but as i said  if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress  this is the one to see           it wasn  t until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producer star of this movie tyrone power died during its making   this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things   a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic   you know when you  ve been painting a wall until you  re completely bored   well that  s the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they  re swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner  br    br   the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it   you can  t really blame them since there  s few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks   though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair   modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents  br    br   after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed   and no that  s not praise   we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who can  t read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them   this is what i don  t get   even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising they  re charging towards a gaping ravine   isn  t this somewhat illogical   it  s also something of a revealing error since the horses   chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures  br    br   anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory   but who needs moshe dayan   arik sharon or god when you  ve got an idiotic enemy who can  t see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall            i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn  t help myself  i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g b   which is unique among allen  s work  along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson  scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop  s most enjoyable aspect  the plot revolves around johanson  s character  a journalism student  who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave  she falls in love with a suspected serial killer  jackman  and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding  oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen  br    br   i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson  s performance but i am a bit bias  i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted  she plays a ditsy  yappy  bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen  s stereotypical neurosis stricken character  she adds appropriate body language for comic effect  needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson  s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus  br    br   allen is allen    he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character  something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however  he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late    br    br   jackman is also enjoyable as the suave  millionaire murder suspect  i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less  br    br   in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh    in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion  johanson and allen are more detective like than anything  however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film  instead of everything being black and white  things are painted in shades of gray  being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt  though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners  i did find his allusions to his last film interesting    come for the humor  laugh and be merry  br    br   needless to say if you enjoy allen  s work watch it  if not watch something else             i rented this film because of my interest in american history  and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons  this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his   vision   into a major world religion  it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo  illinois  it portrays the trial of joseph smith  within the course of that trial  brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism  and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith  then smith is assassinated  and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land  despite his grave doubts  he perseveres  and finally has a vision  that utah is the place for his colony  that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership  later  as crops are destroyed by crickets  he again doubts that he has truly been chosen  however  a miracle occurs  which cements his place in history  br    br   i found the performances to be moving  and the story to be convincing and interesting  i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal  polygamy is a part of the story  but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised  the issue is not emphasized  br    br   i  m sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject matter  but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout                 s   frightmare   is an odd little film  the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic     s     s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding     s slasher genre  it isn  t totally successful  mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints  and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors  but it still has its moments  mostly due to the classy performance  classier than the movie deserves  by the late german actor ferdinand mayne  who plays an aging old time horror movie star  ala vincent price  named   conrad ratzoff    at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he  s shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol   conrad is a bit of a hoity toity  prima donna jerk off  just when you think he couldn  t be any more un likable  the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death  nice  huh  conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club  unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die  still feisty even at death  s door  he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself  conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket  which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects  br    br   it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad  s grave an after hours visit  breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party   not exactly my idea of fun  but hey  these are characters in an     s horror film  logic has no place here   the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad  s body seated in a place of honor  posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it  before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic  planning to return him to his crypt in the morning  in the meantime  mrs  ratzoff  distraught over the theft of her husband  s body  has called in a psychic friend to try and   reach   conrad through a seance  you can pretty much figure out the rest from here  since conrad wasn  t a very nice guy in life  it  s not much of a stretch to assume that he won  t be any friendlier in death  psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion  then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students   ridiculously huge house  picking off the young grave robbers one by one  this is where the movie falls apart  endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying   hello  is anyone there    are intercut with occasional bursts of violence  we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene  which is the highlight of the movie  before the last two survivors finally figure out  way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thing   but again  we  re in an     s horror film   that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad  s body back to its crypt where it belongs  the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music thunder  moans and groans  howls  etc   that becomes severely annoying after a while  br    br   i can  t really recommend   frightmare   to anyone who didn  t grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the     s    modern horror   fans will doubtlessly find   frightmare   incredibly slow moving and goofy  if you came of age in that magical decade  however  you may get a blast of nostalgia from   frightmare    fans of jeffrey    re animator    combs may also want to check it out  as the future dr  west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students  br    br   i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label  paired with roy ward  s   vault of horror   and sold at dollar stores  because the print quality is terrible  i  m told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma  which seems appropriate  if you  re a troma kind of person then   frightmare   will be right up your alley           people watch movies for a variety of different reasons  this movie didn  t have the big budget  there  s no special effects  no car chases and there  s no explosions  actually reality doesn  t have much of these either  at least not in my life   br    br   this is a very real movie about very real people  none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos  i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology  since i  m neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain  br    br   so watch this movie for the characters  it is brim full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk   br    br   within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden  s life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie  excellent acting  very believable   br    br   henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his   harvey   and kiefer  s   mickey   enhances the oppositeness of their characters  br    br   i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady    mrs ramsay    i  m sure she and my mother in law are good friends    br    br   there  s a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them           i think that you can not imagine how these people really work      before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there  i actually thought quite the same as you do  but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv show have to do  i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long  that really is no easy work  and also the actors  which in your eyes may be terribly bad  are really great people and a lot of them really can act  i don  t think that the material given to them can really show that  as i think this material isn  t very good  but they are truly good  so i don  t think that you  before you haven  t seen these guys doing there work  can judge over them  and i shouldn  t have judged over them as well before i met them  but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it  so please  do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven  t seen them doing there job           as usual  i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven  t watched yet in anticipation of the oscars  i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley  i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has  there is no story   a group of guys meander around iraq  one day they are here diffusing a bomb  tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside  by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire  no wait here they are back in bagdad  there is no cohesive story at all  the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures  by that i mean  we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying  we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe  and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn  t follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds  what do you think is going to happen    well  do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn  t follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways   why yes  do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy  why yes  there is no story here  the script is juvenile and predictable  the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look   artsy    and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture  go rent   full metal jacket      deerhunter   or   platoon    don  t waste time or money on this boring movie           a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere  one had a flat tire  the other  s jeep mysteriously won  t start   one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him  when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend  they come across nice mr  slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down  hermit like house  which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins  he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the   girls in the house  before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack  he warns them about   davy    his brother who is lurking about and isn  t all there  of course  one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again  is it slaussen  is it davy  the mannequins   tourist trap has the usual horror requirements  jiggly big boobed girl  goody two shoes girl  curiosity getting the better of people and never working out    but it stands apart from the rest of the     s genre in it  s twist of an ending  i started to feel sorry for slaussen  chuck conners is a terrific  creepy  over the top performance at a point in the film  and you almost see the character of molly doing the same  this is a gem if you can find it  i had taped it off of cable when i was younger  and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced  but well worth it  fans of tanya roberts won  t be disappointed either  best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup  and crackers    br    br   i gave it a   because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain           most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they  re essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five minute segments    tommy boy   is a character right from   snl     a big fat lovable  in their opinion  goof who doesn  t know anything  br    br   david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role  he  s paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy  s business  br    br   the plot  for starters  is really faulty  the whole premise   daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz   can be traced back to just about any movie you want  like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation   empty  shallow  just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be   funny   together  br    br   the movie  s biggest   influence   is the      comedy classic   planes  trains   automobiles    that movie is great because the plot isn  t stale and recycled  it  s basic  yeah   a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob  but it  s real  dammit  it makes all the difference  the characters are real  the situations are far more real    tommy boy   is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters   we feel nothing for them  and we don  t care about what  s happening on screen    pta   walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate able     tommy boy   is simply absurd  with jokes like a simple deer in the headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn  t dead  then awakens and wrecks their car  br    br   the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from   pta   and it  s eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin john candy movie  br    br   farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable   i  ve never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn  t changed my mind  spade  s given very little to do  serving as the movie  s most thankless character  br    br   dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy  s business  the ending is a joke  and not in a   har har funny   way  more like a   oh god are they serious     way  br    br   some people dig it  that  s cool  but i just can  t get into it  nor do i appreciate all the stuff it   borrows   from   not just counting   pt a     without any credit whatsoever           having read during many years about how great this film was  how it established ruiz among the french critics  specially the snobbish cahiers crowd   when i finally watched it about a year ago  i found it pretty disappointing  but then  i guess my expectations were sky high   shot in saturated black and white  this deliberately cerebral film  made for tv  and mercifully  only an hour long  is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings  which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants  and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime   the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument   borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie  but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film           many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare  however  every so often a movie might come along thats honest  funny  entertaining and memorable  the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients  this film follows three friends  gary  rick and david   the big apple    misadventures into the world of first time sex and true love  along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship  we follow hopeless romantic gary  the main character  on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it  s ending  if you haven  t been lucky enough to see this movie yet  by all means take a look   sprinkled with many memorable   s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace  l a v  truly is an original film  a rarity among films of it  s genre           i loved this show from it  s first airing  and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week  the plot  characters  writing  special affects were outstanding  then the sci fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining  well written show  i say bring it back  i know all of the actors would come back  i would suggest buying the dvd  s  i am  i hope the sci fi channels executives get word of these comments  and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers  i only watch one show on that channel now   ghost hunters   but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too           i didn  t know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much  don  t get my wrong its not a bad short film  tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film  you can tell that it has been an act of love for her  the acting  outside of dominic  is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good  there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on  though i don  t feel it greatly detracts for one  s ability to understand the film  if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do  i say go for it  the gag reel was fun  i won  t spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over  if you like the film then check out the pink mirror  a film also done by jagged edge  i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven           did the first travesty actually make money  this is another sequel  along the lines of another stakeout  that no one asked for  but we  ve received it anyway  the sequel is like its predecessor  completely brain dead  it  s also pretty disgusting  remember the dinner scene   to think i almost felt sorry for ritter  yasbeck  and warden  did they need the money that much           i was never so bored in my life  hours of pretentious  self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems  it  s like watching lizards molt  even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy  if you have insomnia  rent this           this movie is awesome on so many levels    and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on  br    br   just remember this  when you  re watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies    be they good or bad    this is the formula that they are using  this is what makes zombie movies so great  br    br   and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie  a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know  br    br   all in all  it doesn  t linger  there  s never a point where you think to yourself   c  mon  get on with it      it moves quick and corners nicely  this is the sporty  little italian number of zombie flicks  br    br   so awful  it  s wonderful  if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek    rent it  buy it  love it  br    br   as a great trivia note  if you  re watching it on dvd  you  ll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen  underneath the musical score    well    that  s because that music was lifted straight from the trailer    which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop           the ladies man is laugh out loud funny  with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes  including the funniest love song ever written   br    br   ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role  br    br   tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you  ll find in any comedy out there  br    br   it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every   months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round  br    br   i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre         and i urge you to vote   br    br   and remember kids    theres more motion in the ocean            when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess        but when i saw the first    minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn  t just be a solid movie  almost everything in this movie is great  the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot  br    br   the only thing that really let me down are the performances  emily blunt the devil wears prada  is the star of the film  bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance  rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt  paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him  jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable  br    br   to me the film feels like unfinished  maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script  i don  t know but that  s how i feel about the movie  br    br   but overall it  s a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt           a flying saucer manned  literally  by a crew of about    male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some    years ago on a   forbidden planet    what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth  a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman  and her father  a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in  br    br   on the surface  this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery  some compare it to shakespeare  s tempest  but this is a stretch  and  in some ways  an insult to the scifi genre  stripped of what makes it a scifi film  sure  its the tempest  but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about   br    br   underneath  this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use  yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek  br    br   anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful  the special effects  and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable  if it were not for the goofy retro art deco ness of     s sci fi props  you might think you were watching a     s piece  br    br   this is a classic of that very special sub genre of sci fi i like to call     s sci fi  and  though not  in my opinion  the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci fi film and special effects  the clever plot  now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek  lost in space  and even farscape  is worth paying attention to  and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans  trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek  s original series aired about    years later  though they may find themselves disappointed by the  relatively mild      s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration  while i do not mean to nitpick  the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it   br    br   some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young  good looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles  unfortunately  nielsen  s performance is only average  and at times down right poor  especially at the climax of the film   walter pigeon  though quite excellent in other films  over acts his role as well  ms francis  earl holliman  and the amazing robby the robot are the stand out actors in this crowd  though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job  the problems with the featured performances  i think  are as much the fault of the director and the editor  as anything  though they certainly got most of the film quite right           i just saw this film on dvd last night  and decided to check out the reviews this morning  it seems that   i  robot   has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb  and given rise to a lot of insults and name calling  too   br    br   i find this somewhat surprising  as this film is not great  or even good   but neither is it terrible  or even really bad   what this film really is  is   depressing  depressing that the us film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid  clich  d re heats  and acclaim them as spectacular new works  this film as   retread   written all over it  from the plot line  an uneasy mix of asimov and modern day uber action  to smith  s character  a smart mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium   to the special effects  that borrowed from matrix and a few others   br    br     i  robot   is  sadly  quite possibly the perfect action movie for today  s audience  superficial plot  insipidly snappy dialog  and lots and lots of adrenaline  smith is mediocre  but we already knew that  he seems to be hollywood  s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis   the story has lots of holes in it  of all sizes  but i don  t think most people drawn to this film are critically minded enough to notice  perhaps a blockbuster by today  s standards  but very b movie compared to true winners           this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects  just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century  br    br   this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people  not white  black  etc  br    br   good movie with a good message           i have bought the complete season of surface  watched it in   days  i was so captured by the the plot  theories and basically everything about this show  the actor who plays miles is great  mile  s sister  mother and father acted like real life family would  you could connect on so many levels it  s fascinating  br    br   i find animals are so wonderful  you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child  it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists  br    br   am sadden  that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows  i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book  br    br   love the show very much  for those who haven  t watched surface  if you like sci fi you need to watch this                       this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen  br    br   i have to disagree with another commenter  who said the special effects were okay  i found them pretty bad  it just wasn  t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story  br    br   maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story  the archaeologists are looking for   the set    they do not bother to tell what set  or what is so special about it  that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california  while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt  br    br   if you  re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert  take the effort to actually go to the desert  the beginning   the ancient ceremony   looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert  br    br   the action level was constant throughout the movie  no ups and downs  no climax  it made the movie look short  and that  s certainly a pro for this particular movie           liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early   th century  he is a true actor  he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles  jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary  mary is such a beautiful woman  it  s her love that makes rob roy the legend  but it  s his passion that makes her love undying  they need each other  tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect  in one way or another  upon watching the movie  you will find cunningham disgusting  the scotland scenery is beautiful  the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well  if you like history  romance  passion and love  you  ll enjoy rob roy  there is violence and blood  but it  s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told  no gratuitous violence  and you do have to listen carefully if you  re not used to a scottish accent  one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized  they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes  it  s their skill as actors that attracts you  they don  t rely on marquee names  popularity or sex symbol appeal  this is something special           when i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world  she has beautiful and charming body  when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body    i think male have hard to resist    i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes  at least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like seema biswas to c in bandit queen i concur with what mallicka b has said  the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content  emotions aren  t conveyed properly  i guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to its mediocrity  in my view  tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai  in some of her scenes  she looks a bit lusty  which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed  i also noticed a bit of over acting in some of her scenes  i  m a bitter critic of aishwarya rai    can  t help it  sorry for that    raincoat   was a good movie by rituparno ghosh  and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat  i was not at all impressed         they ve shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it  the bad acting isn t enough    the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists  i love the original from      so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead  because this one is such a bore          having seen carlo lizzani  s documentary on luchino visconti  i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low  but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied    i faced a need for critical opinion  which i generally don  t like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer  there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally  but when i read the reviews already written on this title  i also felt a bit confused  people sometimes don  t know what to criticize  therefore  to be clear  i  ll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably  the former one about visconti before his director  s career and latter one about visconti the director   br    br   the aristocratic background  all the hobbies  the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented  his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents   divorce  we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano  in riches galore  with nannies  cooks with access to everything  in true aristocracy  for instance  his father  s splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that  there is also an emphasis on visconti  s crucial visit in paris in the     s where he met eminent people    left wingers    who later had impact on his style and message in art  that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing  a contrast at first sight    br    br   however  the part about his director  s career  which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director  s death in       is poorly executed  his movies are not discussed well  why  because there are very few people who really have something to say  franco zeffirelli  the director  remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right  there are also some interviews with franco rosi  but later  such movies like il gattopardo  la caduta dei rei  la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger  although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig  i did not like the interviews of his  moreover  some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary    there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece  there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster  a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made  there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit  franco zeffirelli  though i appreciate him as a director  makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious  for instance  he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service  therefore  i say  simplified and unsatisfactory   br    br   what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself  as a result  we may get his own opinion about his works  for instance  i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself  he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig  br    br   i believe it is better to see luchino visconti        by carlo lizzani than this doc  although it is shorter and condensed as a whole  you will get a better idea of the director  visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people  s emotions and viewpoints into stone                  time is precious  this film isn  t  i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time  br    br   the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction  is this the film the critics are raving about  what a piece of crap  br    br   the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family  get it  br    br   the acting is superb  br    br   the production  lighting  sets  editing  sound  is about   steps above a    minutes story  the characters are shallow and unintelligent  i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience  the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next  br    br   i have had more fun doing the laundry           worst  movie  ever made  ever  i have no words to say about it   other then it truly had no point  no plot  no    anything  sheer crap    i don  t know how everyone in the movie didn  t shoot them shelves after watching it                      i love vampire flicks and mysteries  and alternate abstract outside the box films  and     this was non of those  i mean what the crap    i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don  t know  and i just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it    bottom line   i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs  thats the only thing i got from this film  please don  t watch this    i mean for a    sultry sensual vampire flick   there wasn  t even the to be expected nudity you  d get from a vamp flick  anyway back to my point     this movie blows  go set yourself on fire instead                    savage island        is a lame movie  it  s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting  not only that the storyline and script was wretched  i don  t know why this movie was made  i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry  this one made my blood boil  the situations were inane at best  if i made a movie like this it would have been a short  really because those backwood   idjits   wouldn  t have been in the picture  br    br   don  t be fooled by the cover on the d v d  i am an avid watcher of bad cinema  but this movie is virtually unwatchable  i don  t mind movies being shot on d v  but if you  re going to do that make the movie enjoyable  not some tired retread of superior horror films  sans wrong turn   br    br   i have to not recommend this waste of disk  if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by  br    br   movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic            i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time  i have seen it well over     times  actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching  it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in  i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again  buy a copy now it is a classic             i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning  i  m going to assume that one  s level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one  s level of acceptance of joseph  s story  br    br   however  that aside it was very well made  well acted  and had a nice score  if you get to salt lake city  it is a must to see it in the legacy theater  i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality  sound quality and ambiance in my entire life   i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there  being that i  m lds and regard joseph as a prophet  i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times   which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started  anyway  i  m told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe  if you have    minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not  he tells a fascinating story           adenoid hynkel  a lowly soldier in world war one  rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania  he creates an aggressive  antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache  sound like anyone you know  br    br   from the safety of hollywood  chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini  given that the united states in      had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it  and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe  s civil strife  remember  it was hitler who declared war on the usa  not the other way round  it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic  br    br   the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides  and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly  humane  brave  etc   etc  chaplin is hynkel  and he also plays the jewish barber  the little hero of the ghetto  the tramp in all but name   needless to say  chaplin writes  directs  stars  composes the music and does the catering  br    br   in      the full truth was not yet known about the third reich  and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight  but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong  a comedian and a sentimentalist  chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless  all this does is to humanise him  when hynkel the not very warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside down aeroplane  he becomes endearing rather than despicable  as dictator  he inspects his subordinates   technical innovations which don  t work  the parachute hat  the bulletproof uniform etc   and these passages are meant to make us think that the real life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside  in fact  hynkel  s regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery  br    br   in truth  chaplin  s day had already passed when he made this ill considered polemic  at heart  he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen  check out the humour  with gags like staggering up and down the street semi conscious  or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings   the hero schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged  but schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a nazi  is it in any way believable that a schultz figure  if such had existed  would say to the fuehrer  s face    your cause is doomed to failure because it  s built upon the stupid  ruthless persecution of innocent people    and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto  if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt  why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform  chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz birkenau or treblinka  but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age  as usual  chaplin thinks in terms of   silent   comedy set pieces  loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line  there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers  shaving a man to the accompaniment of brahms  and the globe ballet  watch for the segment filmed in reverse   br    br   paulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah  just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice  and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic  so hannah is quite literally too good to be true  brave  defiant  resourceful  hardworking and  of course  beautiful  she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage    gee  ain  t i cute    she asks  after the barber gives her a make over  too cute by far  is the answer  she doesn  t come close to ringing true  because chaplin has made her a caricature  the   wouldn  t it be wonderful    speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author   too wordy  too emotionally cloying  br    br   jack oakie is great as napaloni  the fascist dictator of bacteria  he brings a whiff of much needed comic brio to the proceedings  but the film  s underlying weakness remains  if napaloni is silly and ineffective  how can we fear him  and anyway  the stuttering stop start of the back projected train is a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth  br    br   and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform             milo   is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked do we really need more slashers i for one think we already have more than enough i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that  s also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it a long time ago he drowned but that didn  t bother him and he still kills people   friday the   th   what  s that   one day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist milo comes to pay them a visit through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo  s dull i mean dark secret she and her friends have been dying to know once discovered milo goes on yet another murderous rampage isn  t it his bedtime yet   and the girl well she screams a lot the acting is not even bottom of the barrel the barrel refuses to be associated with it milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that but some movies just can  t be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity           this is one of the best horror   suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts  it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill  thrills  and yes a lot of gore   house of wax sure delivers    in parts it was sort of far fetched the acting was not that great but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten      if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats  this is just the right movie for you i have to admit it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax       i myself enjoy these museums  but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way           never saw the original movie in the series   i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the       s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified  this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now  anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie  it was  however  a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark  really  this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen  the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm  other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid  the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water  not really worth watching i would however like to see the original  granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the     s  but he also made a very good slasher movie in the     s   the town the dreaded sundown             created in       and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name  because his wife convinced him   mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand  i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey  it is in fact his third  but it doesn  t matter  for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable  the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge  stopping to pick up cargo  and minnie mouse missing the boat  being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them  mickey helps her crank it  s tail and play the tune  and getting some other animals to be percussion  until pete comes along again to stop him  making mickey peel potatoes  mickey mouse was number    on the     greatest pop culture icons  and he was number    on the     greatest cartoons  very good           highly regarded at release  but since rather neglected  immense importance in the history of performing arts  a classic use of embedded plots  one of my favourite films  why hasn  t the soundtrack been re released           the perfect murder is foiled when a wife played by mary ellen trainor  once the wife to director robert zemeckis  who helmed this episode   who murders her husband with a poker  has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside  an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit played by a deviously hideous larry drake   she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband  s corpse  she decides to use an ax  once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman  s head  to frame the killer for her husband  s murder  santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman  s daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child  br    br   this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old   santa kills   theme while also adding the oft used add nauseum woman murders her husband for a man she  s been cheating with routine  it  s essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac  there  s nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions  not one of the show  s highlights           the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film  it should have read   be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the  rd pew from the back of your family  s church at   years old  listening to the preacher drone on about god  s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego    br    br   it starts off well intentioned  building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny  s   how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast    moment  it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree  sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic induced babble  i believe i counted the use of the word   pray   about    times in a five minute span near the end  after the   st  i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym    prey    sadly  this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last    minutes  plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say   prayer      preyer   to me  as it became totally zany  indeed  even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom  almost to the point of ending up on the floor  br    br   for all the salivating christians who ranked this film      stars  i suggest sticking with your theology reinforcing safety standards like circle square  the ten commandments  anything from narnia  jesus christ superstar and the like  stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp  the god who wasn  t there  what would jesus buy  or the soon to be released religulous  br    br   maybe robert whitlow  s book is better           tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford  s films  at two hours  it was quite long for a      silent film yet continues to hold your interest some    years after it was filmed  mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a   greatest hits   performance with bits of mary the innocent  mary the little devil  mary the little mother  mary the spitfire  mary the romantic heroine  etc  characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past  the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character  s illegitimate child for      and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question  if the academy awards had been around in       no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary  s           i first saw this movie when i was about    years old  my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for    on vhs  she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch  this movie  however  scared the hell out of me  you may be asking yourself  how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone  the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions  pitch  to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas  that  s right  satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause  pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day  for if santa doesn  t make it back to his home in space  he turns to powder  don  t get me wrong  the movie is funny and fairly entertaining  however  the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell  which occurs at the beginning of the movie  is just downright creepy           although there are some snippets in this   part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform  these are not very well developed  in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs  br    br   although this program  as a whole  leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money  and for that it deserves some praise  almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to  very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you  if asked  they think the drug war is designed to solve  for example  while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the     s  at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law  forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business  but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence  the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame  inexplicably  alcohol prohibition  the violence that ensued  and the subsequent reversal of prohibition  is totally ignored by this program  br    br   this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users  and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war  the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on  use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems  but not all users do their drugs in excess  just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics  br    br   if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government  for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science  has decided to totally prohibit  whose users it has decided to not so metaphorically wage war against  just forget about it  none of that is in here  br    br   on the other hand  this is hardly in the category of anti drug propaganda  it is mostly an interesting neutrally presented history of drugs in   th century united states like marijuana  lsd  heroin  cocaine  mdma  and oxycontin  but there is a significant element of various people  s points of view with regard to drug laws  and most  but not all  of that is not very thoughtful or well informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality  especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana   br    br   the criminal justice system  along with its often harsh life ruining penalties  is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem  but unfortunately there  s an epidemic in this nation of an as yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs  a lack of compassion for fellow humans  a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally approved  perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison policing industry  and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity  it  s morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so  and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason  this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs  yet this program ignores it  br    br   so  in sum  the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining  but when it comes to presenting a rational non radical point of view with regard to drug policy  and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives  it  s pretty disappointing           considering this film was released   years before i was born  i don  t feel too bad for over looking it for such a long time  back in january of    though  i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin texas  the particular theme of films this night was   neglected     s crime films   and boy was her right    the gravy train or the dion brothers  as it appeared this print    was an absolute gem  wonderful performances  quirky characters  smart plot  hilarious comedy  and just an all around great time  rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh  margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well  i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it  in the meantime  go to an indie video store and hope they have it           the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group  in their endeavors  the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin  whom sister goes after because she believes he is the   big time   who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life  though he could be accused of killing her  he really kills only her spirit and will to live  after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose  the story isn  t about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off  then threatens him  it  s about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be   discovered   back then           first  i realize that a       rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst  this movie gets that from me because  as one reviewer points out  it  s not bad in a self aware  over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value  it simply misses its mark on every count    contains possible spoilers   the dialog is completely disingenuous  the continuity is so deliberate it  s painful  daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love  and with his final word the flamenco dancers start  the mock shock of what  s her name  see  i don  t even remember her character  s name  let alone the name of the forgettable actress  when her husband  the baldwin  first tells her that her friend is the bad guy  the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things  vegetable carts gone flying  cars crashing into each other  motorcycles going down the stairs  people nearly being hit  but remarkably  no one is  oh  that  s right    except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times  is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds  and an approaching car apparently didn  t notice him there  hmmm   br    br   it  s becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made  there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money  you  d think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing  now there  s a novel idea   br    br   my suggestion  don  t see this film  don  t rent the dvd  don  t watch it on cable  there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied           picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says   lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public  also black  in the street and ask him if he is black  then walk away    the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode  more laughter  now if you think the premise is funny  and the show contains many such types of situation  you will enjoy this show  for the rest  use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry  those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny  another example of the humor in the show  a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier  marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers  i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers  divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all           the year      saw no fewer than   filmed productions of h  g  wells   great novel    war of the worlds    this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them  no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it  but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place  the last year of the   th century          using wells   original setting  in and near woking  england  br    br   imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as   spoilers    that might apply with some films  where the ending might actually be a surprise  but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world  it seems positively silly  i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature  so let  s get right to the chase  the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease  against which they have no immunity  if that  s a spoiler  so be it  after a book and   other films  including the      classic   you ought to know how this ends  br    br   this film  which follows wells   plot in the main  is also very cleverly presented    in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late   th early   th century photography  although filmed in a widescreen aspect  the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity  the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs  rather than black   colors are often reminiscent of hand tinting  at other times  colors are washed out  these variations are typical of early films  which didn  t use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality  even going from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on    as you  ll see on occasion here  the special effects are deliberately retrograde  of a sort seen even as late as the     s    and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic   feel    some of effects are really awkward    such as the destruction of big ben  the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours  some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd  particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair  br    br   this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells   original narrative    as has been noted  viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story  wells   description of the martians    a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles    is effectively portrayed  when the martian machines appear  about an hour into the film  they too give a good impression of how wells described them  both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective  primarily  of rural england    plus a few scenes in london  involving the narrator  s brother   the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark  big ben   but at least doesn  t dwell unduly on the devastation of london  br    br   the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise  despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines  the narrator  traveling about to seek escape  sees much of what wells terms   the rout of mankind    he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality  they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest  where they discover an awful fact  the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene  wells adds that after eating they set up   a prolonged and cheerful hooting    the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate    who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder  cheers from the gallery  british curates are so often utterly insufferable   br    br   this film lasts almost   hours  going through wells   story in welcome detail  it  s about time the author got his due    in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact  a word about the acting  don  t expect award winning performances  they  re not bad  however  the actors are earnest and they grow on you  most of them  however  have had very abbreviated film careers  often only in this film  the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana  in his  nd film  the curate is john kaufman    also in his  nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing  the brother    henderson    is played with some conviction by w  bernard bauman in his first film  the artilleryman  the only other sizable part  is played by james lathrop in his first film  br    br   this is overall a splendid film  portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it  despite its slight defects  it is far and away better than any of its hyped up competitors  if you want to see h  g  wells   war of the worlds    and not some wholly distorted version of it    see this film           of the elements that make this the best at this point  i have to say    is christine mcintire  shemp  s scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent  i imagine that  as one poster suggested  christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene  but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil  to be smiling at shemp  s possibly dying  br    br   another character who helps this stand out is the goon  his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof ball  hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or  for that matter anywhere  i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this  but hey  when a short is this good  who  s going to complain  not i           okay this is stupid they say their not making another nightmare film that this is the   last   one   and what do they do they go on making another one not that the next one  part   was bad but why do they play us  anyway this movie made no sense what so ever it was extremelly dull the characters were highly one dimensional freddy was another joker which is very stupid for such a good series the plot is very very bad and this is even worse than part   and    i didnt get the movie its a stupid tale in   d pointless id say  i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film this is so different than the prequels it tries and tries but this one tried the hardest and got slapped back on the face again there were hadly any death scenes although they were different they sucked bigtime  how can they have gone this far didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts   and   yet they make this its all bout the money do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series  br    br   i gave a nightmare on elm street six       out of     br    br   good points of movie  had potential with plot  br    br   bad points of film  terrible acting lack of deaths too funny to be classified as horror very confusing           everyone  my name may sound weird  but there was nothing else   br    br   any way  i haven  t seen anything like this before so it was crazy  of course that  s a good thing  it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one  like chicken little   the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying    twas beauty who killed the beast    war of the worlds scene and more  walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one  also  how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema   br    br   however some parts don  t fit  like in the original lion king  weren  t timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar  in this movie  they are not  they were fighting the hyenas backstage  ther  s more  the reason being why pumbaa isn  t so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also  it  s just timon  timon  timon  anybody realise that only timonn  s story was told  whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks  br    br   but apart from that   it  s great           finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie  which not only tells a story  but actually tells the   real   story  i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller  but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations  then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o  donnell  you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is  it is not a movie to attract new fans  but a movie to tell the real tale  some things could have been better  but when you cannot forget the awful movie from      then is this a magnificent movie  so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story           by now  the game  s stale  right  br    br   the jokes have been done  its all over  the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone  after all  br    br   wrong  br    br   the game is still intact  the jokes are here  folks  sure  they  re all rehash  but so was monkey island    and    for that matter  br    br   the difficulty is well placed  somewhere between the slightly easy   and the ridiculously hard    the ship fighting sub game is badly innappropriate  in the tradition of sub games  and this game has the best joke of the whole series  when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach  always select   you don  t need to see my identification    its worth the price of the game by itself           i decided to watch this movie because i  d not seen carol lombard before in any movie  i  m sorry it had to be this one because  quite frankly  this is a dog    and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn  both of whom were great actors  br    br   the problem with the film is simple  it tries to put too much  too quickly  in to a story about a young lawyer  john manson played by stewart  who marries jane  played by lombard  within an hour of meeting her  what  s that clich    marry in haste  repent at leisure     br    br   in short  the story is a series of episodes that show the couples   worsening financial status  their troubles with john  s live in mother  their struggles to pay the bills  john  s diminished status at the office  the arrival of their baby son  john jnr  unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother   the couples   angst about their marriage  the baby  s sickness which worsens  thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot  in a fierce storm  to bring a special serum to save the child  and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm  br    br   how many more clich  d situations could the writers include  maybe mother dying soon after  there wasn  t much comedy  the drama was lacklustre  at best  the dialog was painful to hear  only the acting of the four main players was adequate  br    br   this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn    during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie  br    br   so  it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol   home spun american values of family  relationships  heroism  perseverance  and initiative    all against the backdrop of the   average   american family  who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard   br    br   and  it should be noted that the film was released in early       so  it was planned in         soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii  hence  this sort of film was a great booster for the general public  at that time  many of who would soon have to join england in war  as many here would know  hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before  during and after the war  br    br   however  i  m glad i saw it    as a piece of disguised socio political propaganda  but  i  ll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range  br    br   as another reviewer noted  see this one just to say that you  ve seen all of stewart  s movies  otherwise  don  t bother           unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there  s nothing to spoil about that movie even if b  mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director  but for the last    years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty  nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first    min no sex  no blood it  s suppose to be about snuff   no actors  no dialogs  just as bad as an     t v film it  s even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno  you will stay in our minds forever anyway  thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi    robowar rats  l  altro inferno virus  cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco  s spirit  s new film  pass on this one but if you don  t know this nice artisan  s career track down his old films and have fun           i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting            hypothetical situations abound  one time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead  left in the streets  in the stores  and throughout the landscape  sans in the middle of a forgotten desert  one lone survivor  attempting to rekindle his sanity  takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert  all alone  he hopes for more  but with nobody around  he is left with white underwear  and a passion for a local indian tribe    until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co existence  alan  a man of the book  is left on earth after an unknown disaster  thinking he is alone  he begins living life his way    until  jeri ryan  appears  like she would in any dream  out of the woods  disheveled  and unhappy to find the final man alive to be     well     like alan  anyway  they try to co exist  fail  get drunk  and before creating the ultimate dystopia  they run into redneck raphael  played by newcomer    dan montgomery jr   bonds are torn  confusion sets in  a couple becomes a third wheel  and the battle between physically inept nerd vs  brainless jock  even with nobody left on the planet  it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise  br    br   using a variable film technique  ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled   the quiet earth    which i will be viewing next  oddly which he never gives any credit towards  with a borrowed story  i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it  his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride  borrowing yet again from other film director  s techniques to attempt to find his own  he opens the film interestingly enough  but fails to answer any direct answers  sure  the final days have arrived  but could there be a concise answer as to   how   or better yet   why   these select few survived  a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film  the juxtaposition would have been like   shawn of the dead    but instead left us feeling like we were watching a   made for tv   program  listening to the audio commentary  i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made  and his passion nearly sells the film  but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn  t as happy with his overall final product  there were mistakes  ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out  while this does make for decent independent film making  it sometimes feels cheap  and in ralston  s case  it was the latter  br    br   i must admit  david arnott  s portrayal of alan hooked me  he played that wimpy  school nerd  adult role very well  he was funny to both watch and listen to  and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer  he was a key player in keeping the film together  alas  i cannot say the same for the rest  this was dan montgomery  s first film  and it was obvious    i mean    really really obvious  there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him  perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance  but alas  it wasn  t the case  then there was jeri ryan  she pulled into her character near the end of the film  which to me  was the culmination of the entire piece of art  she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end  confused  again  she fell into her character by the end  giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured  even as the commentary progressed  all that she contributed was a laugh  giggle  or   ohhh  look at that color   moment  while her beauty may sell tickets  one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful  this was her first film  so can i be too harsh   br    br   overall  this film felt like it was missing something  i though the idea was strong    the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists  jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs  maybe because it is consumed by zinc   and we as a race will always want what we cannot have  ralston is not a surprising director  his techniques are flawed and pre used  but he does know how to make a low budget comedy  i think our idea of   funny   is different  so that is why i couldn  t find myself laughing at many of the bits he found   hysterical    his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film  which was lower than average  his film was loose  meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled  i e  anything with wings survived      which overall harmed the intensity of the film  this was a comedy  but it could have been much darker and much much funnier  for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film  as we learn from their commentary  all he was there for was money    the was in essence  the bank for   the last man    don  t get your hopes up for any classic avery moments  br    br   don  t expect more from ralston    and that is how i will end it  br    br   grade     out of                 br    br   i must admit  i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of   cut   last night  though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem  i am a true horror fan as true as they come  and found   cut   to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced  but one of the great parody comedy films of late  br    br   my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements   the film was not overly clever in it  s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could  i am certain this was intended as humour    hoping this was intended as humour  br    br   and of course  there was the gore  br    br   the use of the   customised   garden shears was brilliance   besides the expected stabs and slashes  in short  there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths  enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth  br    br   the appearance of both kylie minogue  short that her appearance was  and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film   both performances were fantastic  as well as simon bossell    the castle    in a brilliant role as the jokey technician  br    br   all in all  i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years  as well as a beautiful satire parody   toungue in cheek till the very end  br    br   loved it  go see it           i am so happy not to live in an american small town  because whenever i  m shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies  evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless  in this movie a former doctor  who  s just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash  directs his steps to the nearest small town   he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns   which happens to be the purgatory flats  and  of course  as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose  he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her  but there is a tiny handicap  she is already married to a very small time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead  to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself  i  ll just tell you that it  s slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties           like anyone else who bought this  i was duped by the      pieces of extreme gore   and   banned in    countries   or whatever it says in the box  i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it  tom savini  rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business  the revolutionized make up effects in the     s  today  you don  t need them as everything is done on computer  but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up  but i digress  br    br   watching fantastically gory films like fulci  s gates to hell or even savini  s crowning achievement  friday the   th the final chapter  you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film  you can  t tell the difference between reality and magic  br    br   i can  t imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film  if that is the reason you seek this film  then you are wasting your money  as many other reviewers in here have noted  most of the gore is an aftermath  you don  t see the torture  or the bloodshed as it happens  you see whatever it looks like afterwords  br    br   the gore  well  it  s here  but not as much as one would hope  or expect  a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts  but other then those two scenes  and one involving a scalping  there is nothing really much else to this film  the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned  are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for  maybe it  s just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre  but i was expecting a bit more  call me sick or twisted  but isn  t that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place  i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places  br    br   cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film  while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film  it is much better than this tripe  if you go out of your way to buy this for         you will feel cheated  br    br                 i always felt that ms  merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills  familiar to millions as the lt  on law and order  she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases  always in a supporting role  hbo  s lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny  successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration  but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna  new york  a suburb of buffalo  br    br   the story could be set in any major african american community of the     s and     s from atlanta  s sweet auburn to new york  s harlem  but the segregation integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny  s boarding house  the story revolves around nanny  s relationships with all kinds of people  played by some of the best actors in the business  i purposely did not say black actors  this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black  except for jimmy smits  of course  i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day           this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year  a few too many coincidences and plot holes  however we are talking about a movie where a hit man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn  t come as too much of a surprise  brosnan is excellent in this role  gone is the wooden james bond  a role he was wasted in   if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies  greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan  s straight man  i  ve read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within  there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing  my father  a consultant  nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a   facilitator    much like   grosse pointe blank    another hit man comedy  the humour can be very dark  if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself           as a casual listener of the rolling stones  i thought this might be interesting  not so  as this film is very   of its age    in the       s  to me  someone born in the       s  this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap  but i am sure this film was not made for me  but people who were active during th       s  i expected drugs galore with th stones  i was disappointed  it actually showed real life  hard work in the studio  so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film  i have not seen any of the directors other films  but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing  sort of   amatuerish   which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash  badly directed  tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value  my only good opinion of this is that i didn  t waste money on it  it came free with a sunday paper           watch the original with the same title from       this made for tv movie  is just god awful  although it does use  as far as i can tell  almost the same dialog  it just doesn  t work  is it the acting  the poor directing  ok so it  s made for tv  but why watch a bad copy  when you can get your hands on the superb original  especially as you  ll be spoiled to the plot and won  t enjoy the original as much  as if you  ve watched it first   br    br   there are a few things that are different from the original  it  s shorter for once   but all are for the worse  the actors playing the parts here  just don  t fit the bill  you just don  t believe them and who could top edward g  robinsons performance from the original  if you want  only watch it after you  ve seen the original and even then you  ll be very brave  if you watch it through  it  s almost sacrilege           director don siegel really impressed me with this film  it is starkly shot  graphic without being visually graphic  well acted by all concerned  and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike  almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer  i didn  t know what to expect sitting down to watch this  a civil war movie or some kind of     s soft core peddling with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south  but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination  exploration  and descent into the soul of men and women   a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized  as one reviewer previously noted  none   none   of the characters are likable by the film  s end and yet each one is interesting  complex  and enigmatic  eastwood plays cpl  mcburney  a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin you  ll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it   a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war   particularly in the south  soon  page  teacher elizabeth hartman  lovely  young seductress carol  and even ferdin amy have emotional sexual ties to eastwood   each having their own needs and secrets and problems  eastwood is not a nice man  he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage  in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest  the beguiled  for me  is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front  this might be except for invasion of the body snatchers  siegel  s best film  it certainly is one of eastwood  s best real performances  page is always so very good and hartman  fe rdin  et al excellent  the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic  some of the sexual laced scenes disturbing  and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy  eerie  demented film           anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film  it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a   spring break movie   plus it makes fun of the college film genre  it  s funny  it  s got a cast to die for  amy pohler  rachel dratch   sophie monk   parker posey  jane lynch  amber tamblyn  missi pyle   and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud  writer  actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain  wilson phillips  omg   i  m just repeating myself now     it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they  re dumb           arguably the finest serial ever made no argument here thus far  about earthman flash gordon  professor zarkov  and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet  along the way  in spellbinding  spectacular  and action packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin  prince thun  and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura now she  s a car    this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot  acting  and budget   it is miles ahead in these areas  produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few  the production values across the board are advanced  in my most humble opinion  for       the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first rate  we get hawk men  shark men  lion men  high priests  creatures like dragons  octasacks  orangapoids  and tigrons oh my  and many  many other fantastic things  are all of them believable and first rate special effects  no way  but for      most are very impressive  the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well written  lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter  and expertly scored  director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymond  s phenom comic strip  lastly  the acting is pretty good in this serial  all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents   here most everyone has some ability  don  t get me wrong  this isn  t a shakespeare troupe by any means  but buster crabbe does a workmanlike  likable job as flash  he is ably aided by jean arden  priscella lawson  and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out  but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted  it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office  i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later  the shorts crabbe and unfortunately for all of us professor zarkov  frank shannon   wears are about as form fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear  the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell  lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful  but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming  officious  sardonic  merciless  and fun  middleton is a class act  jack   tiny   lipson plays king vultan  boisterous  rousing  hilarious   a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism  lipson steals each and every scene he is in  the plot meanders here  there  and everywhere   but flash gordon is the penultimate serial  space opera  and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow  excellent           i have to say that the events of      didn  t hit me until i saw this documentary  it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation  i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers  i was sick of hearing about it  when this was aired on tv a year and a day later  i was bawling my eyes out  it was the first time i had cried since the attack  i highly recommend this documentary  i am watching it now on tv    years later  and i am still crying over the tragedies  the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing  it was an accident  and look where it got them  these two brothers make me want to have been there to help           perfect movies are rare  even my favorite films tend to have flaws   rear window looks a little stagey at times  chris elliot  s character in groundhog day doesn  t work  the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy  the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow   but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish   br    br   the script is brilliant  the acting is superb all around  although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing  the whole cast shines   the directing and the photography are inspired  and the music score is touching without being intrusive  like some miramax scores that are too manipulative   every sad moment is truly moving  every light moment makes me smile  this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it   br    br   i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film  but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people  real feelings and real problems  brilliant  a must see           this has to be one of the   worst movies ever made  the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger     but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better  the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way  just a few of the awful moments in the movie  a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying     and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the     mile per hour winds    thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at      feet  thats impossible even for     pilots with thousands of hour experience  when on the runway  perfectly straight of course  she is instructed to pull on the flaps  huh   come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds  when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power  i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie  but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary  this is a movie you want to miss  take my word for it           regardless of what anyone says  its a b movie  and the effects are poorly done   if you  re a vampire fanatic  i suppose it would be ok  not    out of     you others here cant sincerely mean that   we are to view this as a movie  not read it as a book  so the effects and characters are important  as well as the story  the story are good  but it doesn  t carry the film  no wonder it has a low rating over all  i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb  but got severely disappointed  don  t get me wrong  i thought the blade movies was awesome  and loved the underworld movies  but this characters aren  t close  the make up on the vampires is poorly done  and the effects are worse  this sucks  i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was  the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something  seriously  if you think this is awesome  you don  t care about acting or make up  this is better as a book    out of    for an ok story            i want very much to believe that the above quote  specifically  the english subtitle translation   which was actually written  not spoken  in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist  was meant to be self referential in a tongue in cheek manner  but if so  director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film  they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here  or else has so much disdain for everyone  especially the viewing audience  that he can  t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke  br    br   some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique  bizarre films because they do so with   lan and unique personal style  e g   david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky   others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story  e g   krzysztof kieslowski  and david cronenberg  s later  less bizarre works   in pola x  carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it  well  here it is  the pacing is erratic and choppy  in particular continuity is often dispensed with  superfluous characters abound  e g   the gypsy mother and child   most of the performances are overwrought  the lighting is often poor  particularly in the oft discussed sex scene  unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason  and the list goes on  br    br   not to be completely negative  it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions  i liked the musical score  even the cacophonous industrial techno music being played in the sprawling  abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film  perhaps a reference to andy warhol  s   factory   of the     s    much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful  an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings  and  even well into middle age  cathering deneuve shows that she still has   it    her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn  t sink into bathos  br    br   there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as   pola x   more charitably  experimentation is admirable  even when the experiment doesn  t work  but carax tries nothing new here  the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films  and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of films later  i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal  poorly crafted tripe  at this early moment in the   st century  one is left asking  with the exception of jean pierre jeunet  are there  any  directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore  rating                 it  s hard to praise this film much  the cgi for the dragon was well done  but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow  also  the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious  br    br   i was amazed to see   marcus aurelius   in the acting credits  wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film  like   whoopie goldberg   it must be an alias  and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker  br    br   the story might been interesting  but the acting is flat  and direction is tedious  if you must watch this film  go around to your friend  s house and get drunk while doing so   then it  ll be enjoyable           i remember going to see the movie in the summer of      with my parents  and being pretty into it at the time  of course  i was seven at the time  br    br   right before the jackson movies came out  my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic  br    br   ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid way through the animation process for this movie  and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production  since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping  the animation technique for people on a budget  this is saying something  much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word  there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen  with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them  br    br   because of budget constraints  the movie    already a compression of   the fellowship of the rings   and part of   the two towers      was pared down even more  what you get is sort of like a film strip version of the cliff notes of the books  br    br   its not all bad  though  the animation brings a warmth to it  that i found lacking in the jackson movies  its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding  br    br   this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came  several years later  a half hearted half hour long tv special was aired  which was meant to wrap things up  all i will say about that is that it was a musical           just finished watching  ftm  the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend  something i never do  needless to say i was very disappointed  the story has so much potential and it  s frustrating to see it get screwed up  i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey  first off i am not a mm hater  i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star  i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off     times  yes we all get it that he a good looking guy with a nice body  but i think most people knew this    years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill  showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman     times in the movie is totally unnecessary  i think one time would have been sufficient  it wouldn  t surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other  no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling  unless      enough about that  let  s get into his role  i feel his acting was very forced and he didn  t seem very comfortable  i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner  but his lines were corny and cheesy  it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times  in short  i didn  t like his character even though i was supposed to  the accent  his shirt off  corny pick up lines  weak sales pitches  his character was just too much of a tool  as brandon or jonathan  pacino and assante were great  but that   no surprise  piven is fun to watch as arie    oooops i mean jerry  i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly  it  s insulting that they could take a great story  and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success     cool story that appeals to the male man    hunky hollywood actor for female women  make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights     al pacino with   great speech scenes  and    great one liners    every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan    jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school    throw in armand assante to seal the deal    plot  good writing  character development  and intelligent casting are unnecessary br    br   this will be good enough for most people  but not me  anybody who disagrees with me  ask your self this  would this movie be much better if  a  directed by sodeberg b  decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm br    br   i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks  i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo  the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing  the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants  big budget crapola           i was watching the sci fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on  while not as bad as wynorski  s   curse of the komodo    this still sucks   bad  wynorski uses the same island as in   curse of the komodo    as well as the same actors and house  the effects are top notch  suprising  but thats about it        i don  t know what else to say about this movie       oh yeah  as in   curse of the komodo    the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island  also    when i saw this part i laughed hysterically   a komanbra     part man  komodo and cobra    overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards  just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie    steer clear    to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating   it  s almost over  it  s almost over         out of             i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts  and to be honest  i didn  t know how much i would like it  i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised  driving lessons is a modest  simple film which draws you in right from the start  rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly  he  s definitely one to look out for in the future  dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters  i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity  the highlight of the film  for me was evie  s rather colourful poem  it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs  in my opinion  watching driving lessons is a great way to spend   hours  the scenery was also striking  especially the countryside  anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable  i strongly disagree with          for greta garbo  s first talking picture  mgm wisely chose eugene o  neill  s pultizer prize winning      play anna christie   br    br   also wisely  the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast  george marion as anna  s father  chris  and james t  mack as johnny the priest   transmuted to   johnny the harp   for films so as not to offend    br    br   this little change is interesting  like too many films accused  by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins  of being   little more than filmed stage plays    the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn  t be more faithful to the property  by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn  t offend anyone  or opening it up because they could  too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place   br    br   fortunately  the respect the studio had for both o  neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion  s generally sensitive screen adaptation  wonder of wonders  marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo  s anna reveals her past on   the farm   to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact  what the league of decency must have thought of that   br    br   the source play  s greatest problem has always been that chris  s friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage   the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don  t always recognize   br    br   the perfectly cast marie dressler  who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood  is the perfect balance for garbo  s anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only    minutes  doesn  t allow us too much time to miss her   one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original   and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o  neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne  s second act appearance in show boat   br    br   anna and marthy  s early scene together on screen     minutes into the film  taking each other  s measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece  not to be missed   br    br   anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama  it  s hard to imagine that a latter day remake  which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this      remake  it was first filmed without sound in        also with george marion  s original broadway chris  could improve on this excellent filming   br    br   the internal scenes hew closest to the play  but the exteriors shouldn  t be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere  while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards  the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set  especially in the new york harbor   br    br   nearly all garbo  s naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly  only the too often parodied death scene from camille    years later  will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies   but this anna christie  together with the variety of her      films  mata hari and grand hotel  and the sublime lubitsch touch on her      comedy  ninotchka    garbo laughs      surely stand as her best  br    br   o  neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded   sea plays    should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u s  entered the conflict  the long voyage home         it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie  and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way           let me set the scene  it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies  i am with my friend deciding what to see  we look for a movie that is starting soon and   the grinch   comes up  we buy tickets not knowing what to expect  what we got was a roller coaster of fun  br    br   jim carrey  who may i add is my no   actor in the whole world  was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard  s best movie  next to apollo      the way that this movie was made  the scenery  the actors  the props and the music was just amazing  it really brought this childhood movie to life  br    br   the story is based upon the story of the grinch  as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can  t stand christmas  he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk  but one little girl is going to change the grinch  s look on life and on others in a drastic way  br    br   cindy lou who  played by adorable new actress taylor momsem  meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away  she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people  br    br   all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents  a solid        well done jim  br    br             as a long time fan of all the star trek series i found this a disappointing episode  and i wonder if the liberal use of   flashbacks   featuring will riker  s exploits  both positive  and largely romantic  and negative  lots of pain  and a crewmate  s death was a money saving device  as were many of their   bottle shows    episodes in which all scenes take place on the enterprise   diana muldaur who also appeared at least twice on the original series  deserved a better final appearance than this for her character  dr  kate pulaski  loyal viewers  in the star trek world  is there any other kind   also were shortchanged  this was the last episode of second season  thus  the season ended   not with a bang   but with   a whimper             this tv series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid  even though i see it now through the pink shaded glasses of nostalgia  i can still tell it was a quality show  very educational but still funny  i have not seen the original french version  only the swedish  i have no idea how good the dubbing was  it was too long ago to remember  br    br   the premise of the show was to show you how the body works  i swear  school still hasn  t taught me half of what i know from this show  it also tied in other things  like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don  t exercise  with nice examples within the body  who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you   d the cartoon looked nice  very kids friendly of course  but done with care  cells  viruses  electric signals in the brain  antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures  looking pretty much how you  d expect what they should look like in the animated body  br    br   this  and the series about history especially the environmentally scary finale  were key parts of my childhood  i  m so happy i found them here           fans of the hbo series   tales from the crypt   are going to love this moh episode  those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on  will recognize this one right off the bat  br    br   underrated indie favorite martin donovan  also an excellent writer   co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her  is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way  he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door  or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness  in the case of right to die  he takes the latter approach  and it definitely works  br    br   donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist  robin sydney   much to the displeasure of his inconsolable  unforgiving spouse  abbey  julia anderson   when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of   making up    and she  s horribly burned in a fire  he  s reluctant to pull the plug on her  not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy  corbin bernsen  looking the worse for wear these days    br    br   but abbey  s never been one to give up without a fight  and that  s where the ec theme of the episode comes in  cuckolded husbands   and wives   have always been the genre  s favorite subject matter for some spooky  and ooky  supernatural shenanigans  and this case is definitely no exception  if anything  the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere  br    br   and that  s not to mention that john esposito  s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist  you don  t realize as you  re watching that you only know half the story  until close to the end    think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas  and you  re there   br    br   not a bad effort  but not the best of the lot  either  at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction  especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed  as with most moh episodes  this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment  so the extremely squeamish need not apply           dirty war is absolutely one of the best political  government  and well written t v  drama  s in the    years  br    br

david norwell  suddenly gets a yen for adoption  he pretty much takes the first child offered  a bad choice named adam  as it turns out adam doesn  t have both oars in the water which  almost immediately  causes untold stress and turmoil for dr  norwell  this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another  all centered around adam  s inabilities and seizures  why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained  along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out  personally  i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack  bypass this yawner           this is the who at their most powerful  although before the masterwork who  s next  which would

          this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell    and did so  really awful jumble of unlikely unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line  all without character or clear motivation  br    br   we get clich   snapshots instead of characters  one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss  who projects an overdone   tough guy   persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her  nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase  as in  the smallest from a complete american tourister set  in a bright  sky blue  without explanation or apology  otherwise it  s standard visually    one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in ct           they filmed this movie out on long island  where i grew up  my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie  apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer   which they told me was colored water  tasted disgusting  and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again  especially in the funnel scenes   yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form  it never came out in the theaters  obviously  and it  as far as i knew  was never released on video  and i  m sure wasn  t released on dvd  yet it looks like it was seen by some people  albeit it probably very few  so there must be something  i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother  yet there is no way i can find it anywhere  does anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchased  and which format that would be           that  s how burt reynolds describes this film  which happens to be his best ever  he plays tom sharky  a vice detective who  s on the trail of an international mobster  vittorio gassman  and the man he  s financing to be the next governor of georgia  earl holliman   in the novel by william diehl  the story is more complex because the guy  s running for president  this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two  the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story  reynolds doesn  t do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films  he  s very serious here  especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong  at times though  the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster  s woman  only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax  just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin  sharky  s machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker  julie london  flora purim   buddy de franco  the manhattan transfer  doc severinson  sarah vaughan and joe williams  al capps handles the score with magic  this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever  check it out  br    br   score    out of    stars          human traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends  it is a fly on the wall view into their lives  and minds  which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other  there are many moments in that every one can relate to  like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers  the characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie  the situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in  and that is where this film succeeds  the topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other  the story to the film is not all that  but that is not a criticism  this is a film about people  this is a well written film  with a sound track to die for  d j  s pete tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that i have seen in       after watching this film i felt like i had been out partying all weekend  fantastic movie  jo brand as the voice of reality   need i say more  br    br             this early biograph short was so much fun to watch  the second on disc one of d w  griffith  s   years of discovery   dvd set  highly recommended  it features three excellent performances by the main leads  and interesting to see henry b  walthall  the little colonel  birth of a nation  as a campy musician giving a countess the eye  and other things   br    br   the countess   husband goes berserk at his wife  s betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour  it  s kind of incredible that they wouldn  t hear the wall going up  but hey  maybe the wine had something to do with it  here mr  johnson  father of silent player raymond hackett  gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama  but in an unexpectedly comical way  the best moment comes at the end  as the lady passes out from shock and fear  once she realizes she  s doomed  henry picks up his instrument and   fans   it over her  the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy  and i just lost it  and laughed my head off  the expression on his face  from that moment i was charmed by henry b  walthall           baba   rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life  this is the movie which caused his downfall  it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors  rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred  soon after its release  he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably  its a very bad movie with horrible acting  bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay  throughout the movie  rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease  i  m one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba  first day first show in theatre  the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission  sorry  i  ll not recommend this one to anyone           written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma  scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten  al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana  a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida  this gangster flick is harsh  violent  loud  gross  unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word   f  k   the most number of times  almost three hours long  and yes it can get repulsive  a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord  br    br   also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer  steven bauer  robert loggia  mary elizabeth mastrantonio  f  murray abraham and angel salazar  pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation  he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression  this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster  is that powerful enough for you  crime does not pay for long           first  the cgi in this movie was horrible  i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel  at the end when the owner of the park gets killed  it  s probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen  even night of the living dead had better animation  br    br   that said  the movie had almost no plot  why were they on that island in particular  well  it wasn  t stated in the movie  and  why would the people keep coming into the cat  s area  makes no sense  br    br   one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting  in what could be called a   b made for tv movie   movie  the acting was very good  parry shen stood out in particular  br    br   if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday  watch this movie  it may be good for some memorable quotes           i enjoyed it  there you go  i said it again  i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times  call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard   which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america  van damme moves well for a guy of his age    i think   delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer  if you like old school action and and explosions  this is the movie to watch  this is one of van damme  s best works  br    br   van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen           what a waste of talent  a very poor  semi coherent  script cripples this film  rather unimaginative direction  too  some very faint echoes of  fargo  here  but it just doesn  t come off           although it strays away from the book a little  you can  t help but love the atmospheric music and settings  br    br   the scenes in bath are just how they should be  although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene  but that aside  i like the scene where they are in the hot baths  but did the men and women really bathe together like that  you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women  it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on  but perhaps this was the style at the time  the ballroom scenes were very nice  the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful  i especially liked catherine  s dress in the first ballroom scene  br    br   northanger abbey looked suitably imposing  but i enjoyed the bath scenes better  br    br   schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland  googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel  br    br   ugh peter firth as mr tilney  he just talks a load of rubbish  and is not a clergyman as he should be  it  s hard to think of him being in love with catherine  but then the book never really gave that impression either  br    br   general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy  and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella  ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney  as for john thorpe  well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man  perhaps not the character portrayed in the book  but i quite like it  br    br   i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation  but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me  the marchioness  i hate her  she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy  br    br   some of the script is peculiar  when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks   i suppose you saw the body  how did it appear    what a silly thing to say  elinor  s calm response is stupid too  br    br   anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me          mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive     page point by point  line by line refutation of this mendacious film  which should be titled a convenient lie  the website address where his debunking

demolitions  you  ll realize that alleged   global warming   is no more real or dangerous than the y k scare of       which gore also endorsed  as he did the pseudo scientific film the day after tomorrow  which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber  as james   the amazing   randi does to psychics  and philip klass does to ufos  and gerald posner does to jfk conspir idiocy theories  so does mario lewis does to al gore  s movie and the whole   global warming   scam           a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china  captures the amazement of film  s first audiences pretty much as it  s described to have been worldwide  and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities  i don  t agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellow  s part   i thought he was fine  but the chinese lead really stole the show  in any case  i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie  people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english  which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd            sigh  i  m baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot  i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards  it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration  the set design seen many times before  the whole weak tim burton ish style  and the story that goes nowhere  and we got the   joke   about shooting the crows with the    the first time  alright  br    br   but i guess what  s really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa      called lenore  the cute little dead girl by roman dirge  as any quick internet search will reveal  i mean  what is this  this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker    give your head a shake   as don cherry might say           cute idea    salesgirl linda smith  yolande donlan  inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra  that country  which wasn  t even in north america  was made the   th state     of course  there were only    states at the time  since this was made in          linda travels to the country she has inherited  and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people  at one point  she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo  and it gets ever more sillier from there     although yolande donlan  s heavy lipstick and omni present smile never get ruffled or shmeared  there are other songs scattered through out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess  filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor  or some such equivalent  about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig  cheese vendor  bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war  and was even knighted by qe ii  craig and   the new princess   keep bumping into each other  and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra  s financial problems worsen    fun little farce    along the lines of marx brothers film  also note that donlan later married val guest  the writer and director of our little project  and stayed married for    years  guest was better known for writing and directing his sci fi flicks  in both the uk   the us           back in      a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men  br    br   i have been waiting for years for a good  old fashioned romance between two men  latter days is all that and more  br    br   yes  it is soapy  melodramatic  clich   ridden  and quite corny  that is what makes it so wonderful  there is nothing like a good romantic movie  and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word  br    br   as to the issue of religion  sorry folks  but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now  it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members  gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection  br    br   i loved this movie  it has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance grounded in the reality of the day to day lives of the characters  if i could give it more than ten stars i would  good love stories never go out of style  great love stories like latter days are unforgettable  br    br   it  s about time           the concept of having laurel   hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious  it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics  from especially stan laurel of course as usual  br    br   the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula  it doesn  t really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending  it  s still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless  so it works for the movie  br    br   the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good  sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over the top as the nutty professor  br    br   the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences  which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed  it all helps to make   dirty work   to be one of the better laurel   hardy shorts  br    br                 this movie came as a huge disappointment  the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain  but i expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends  unfortunately  it didn  t  it added more plot holes than it resolved  and confused more than it clarified  the animation and voice acting were great  but with an idiotic plot  dull setting  most of the movie doesn  t even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world   and disappointing ending  ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy  and he ditches winry    it was altogether pretty lackluster  do yourself a favor   disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie  and read the manga           maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i  ve been feeling down in the dumps and it  s such a lovely little fairytale  whatever the reason  i thought it was pitch perfect  great  intelligent story  beautiful effects  excellent acting  especially de niro  who is awesome   this movie made me happier than i  ve been for a while  br    br   it is a very funny and clever movie  the running joke of the kingdom  s history of prince savagery and the aftermath  the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled  that  s much of what makes it so good  it  s an elaborate  special effects laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies  yet there is an incredible attention to small things  br    br   i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again           i was surprised that    forgiving the franklins    did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival  there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie  the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues   you know little issues like religion  sex and the truth  lots of comedy  s seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations  many leave you thinking    i know they ripped this off from some sitcom     this film takes off on its own unique direction   i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film           they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station  they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived  you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot  four young boys playing in grainy slow motion  accompanied by voice over narration  next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion  once they  re grown  it  s easy to spot the writer director among the four  he  s the quiet  contemplative  long haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants  this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood  only there  s no writing  or directing talent on display here  and if you still can  t figure out which one he is  here  s a hint  the auteur and his character have the same middle name  it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty something men were supposed to still be in high school  what looked like a prison was apparently a high school  the warden turned out to be the principal  once more  the poor  misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement  murder and pillage  but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father  how about hitting back  kid  like you do everyone else  numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose  howlingly bad dialogue  many scenes badly out of focus  cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras  drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience  overacting in the extreme  and if you don  t quite get the self important speeches  or the slow motion scenes  just listen to the overbearing music  it will clue you in and what you  re supposed to feel  poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films  the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies  run over puppies chained to a tree  rob and steal  all the while complaining about their sad  sorry lives  but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college  yeah  that  s the ticket  why is it that every twenty something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important  so interesting  that the world can  t wait to see it onscreen  if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems  then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants           i watched this movie so that you don  t have to  i have great respect for kris kristofferson  but what was he thinking  he did this for scale   br    br   at least the film  s title practices truth in advertising  since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film  adding to the confusion  kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn  t sure if genevieve bujold  s character really existed  this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story  br    br   the   making of   feature was far more interesting than the movie itself  it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie  even as the film is being shot  br    br   to it  s credit  this movie is visually pleasing and doesn  t in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over  m  too bad the money wasn  t spent on a better project           just saw this movie on opening night  i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it    i must say  i was not impressed  i  m so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money  br    br   first of all   the messengers   is very predictable  and just not much of a thriller  it might be scary for someone under     but it really did nothing for me  the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie  s resolution  br    br   furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial  some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub par suspense scenes  br    br   if you  ve seen previews for this movie  then you  ve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot  this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters           i went to see this movie  actually i went to see family portraits  which contains cutting moments     other short films by douglas buck  at the mar del plata festival  argentina     i just couldn  t watch it  i had to cover my eyes after the  st half of cutting moments and take a peek every once in a while  by the time it was over  my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed  i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the  nd short begun  btw  of course i was not the only one who left the room   it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me  i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it  i just don  t get how you can love that kind of movies  the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days   i also try to analyze the story  my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it  and i just don  t think it makes any sense  i mean  that amount of violence and stuff  makes no other sense than to try to shock people  and that  s not a good enough reason  i think  there  s absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say   well  at least   x   thing about it was good    but well  i guess i will never understand that kind of films           a well made run of the mill movie with a tragic ending  pluses  the way the story moves   begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he  s there  the music  a disinterested look at the life of policemen  minuses  the violence and the gore  but i guess they add to the realistic effects  still  having people  s heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided  br    br   no complaints                 i don  t understand the positive comments made about this film  it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made  br    br   cartoon characters abound   sue  s foul mouthed  alcoholic  layabout  irish father being a prime example  none of the characters are remotely sympathetic   except  briefly  for sue  s asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence  as desperately unattractive as they both are  i  ve no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob   but given that they do  why should i be expected to care what happens to them  so many reviews keep carping on about how   realistic   it is  if that is true  it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film  br    br   i didn  t like the film at all          steven what have you done you have hit an all new low  it is weird since steven s last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash  shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn t even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway  as for the action well let s just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes  seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege   and   and exit wounds  the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn t make scenes sometimes  flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted   pounds on this garbage   out of ten better luck next time         a call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer  s next target  director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here  his camera swoops around corners in a museum  after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape   divvies up into split screen for arty purposes  practically gives away his plot with a sequence  again in split screen  where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals  and stages his  first  finale during a thunderous rainstorm    dressed to kill   is exhausting  primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial  much of the acting  with the exception of young keith gordon  is mediocre and the  second  finale is a rip off of de palma  s own   carrie    not to mention   psycho    the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock  not an homage  stylish in a steely cold way  the end results are distinctly half baked     from                flat spoilers   br    br   five med students  nelson  kiefer sutherland

visitors  david sees a little black girl shouting crude insults to him  joe sees all the women he has had sex with  and which he videotaped  asking him why from the tv screen  rachel relives her father  s suicide and nelson faces a little boy with murderous intentions  br    br   why are they here  and how will they get rid of them  this tense and interesting movie  set in an hallucinated city and into a gothic med school  is quite the experience  both for the story and the characters  played by then budding stars such as kiefer sutherland  julia roberts  oliver platt  kevin bacon and william baldwin  br    br   the director is joel schumacher  who had already worked with sutherland in   lost boys    and this second cooperation is even better than the first  br    br   a must for psychological thriller horror buds and metaphor lovers  this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs   this is one of the minor classics from the     s that get respect even today  like the mention by rebecca gayheart in   scream     or the tru calling episode which used the movie  s premise  br    br   flatliners                 one of my favorite shows back in the     s  as i recall it went to air on friday  or possibly saturday night on the nine network     here in australia  darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together  br    br   each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent  to their credit  the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible  br    br   i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who   came back   as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital  the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the   power beast   amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames  oh well      you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea  br    br   mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best  br    br   definitely deserves a place in tv  s   hall of fame    to quote tony vincenzo        kolchack you are on it       or  in the case of the hall of fame   in it              i think my summary says it all  this mtv ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x  or is that gen y  type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses  and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations  example  kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his   wedding    kennedy is the bride  done up in a full bridal gown and long wig  the   joke   is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his   bits and pieces    problem is  this schtick goes on way too long  obviously to fill out time  and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun  candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one  running around  constantly asking   do i look fat    i recognize the show was not made for me  it was made for    year old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today  so let them laugh  thank god the show was short lived           frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time  and just at the moment you realize you shouldn  t be laughing  you  ve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness  and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide open mouths and glazen eyes  you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and    well  you get the point  br    br   but for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face  frownland  really is a remarkable piece of work that  after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps  makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time  you feel sickenly sorry for him  br    br   it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronstein  s film  but for some insane reason  i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer  if someone sets you on fire  you typically want to put it out  stop  drop  and roll  but with this film  you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body  you endure the pain  perhaps out of spite  or some unknown masochistic curiosity i can  t even begin to attempt to explain  br    br   unfortunately  mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you  but if you get a chance to catch it  prepare yourself  bring a doggie bag           i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late night     s sitcoms on tv one night at   in the morning  i must say  i didn  t expect much  and i didn  t get much  although rose mcgowan is hot  her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar worthy  to say the least  this movie has its ups and downs  and does have a nice couple of twists at the end  but in all honesty it was awful  not even a typical slasher movie  no gore  no sex  no nudity  no real violence  just bad acting  i  d give it a   out of              i first saw this film when i was about   years old on tv in the uk  where it was called   laupta  the flying island     i absolutely loved it  and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it  i was enchanted by the story and characters  but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music  it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw   sometimes erroneously referred to as the   streamline dub    the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline  which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set  br    br   unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney  the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn  t have the same raw energy that the   streamline   dub or the original japanese had  and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead  they have made some pointless alterations  such as changing the main character  s name from   pazu   to   patzu    and added some dialogue  but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music   the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney  s moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking  which i find annoying in many disney films  br    br   this film still blows away most recent animated films  and i cannot recommend it highly enough  the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market  homogenized animation           this film can  t make up its mind whether its message is   humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless   or   don  t ever go in the water again    a fisherman  nolan  is out to nab a killer whale  a very bad thing  but when he accidentally  accidentally mark you  hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate  the cow    and i use the word in all senses    who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece    throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself   i doubt it was her first   when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds  her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt  kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan  obviously as among humans  total psychos date other total psychos  br    br   the film reeks of half thought out anti human message    the poor poor whale   the evil men must suffer and die    and yet  it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all  it  s true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel  but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and  as the film progresses  he grows more and more compassionate to the whale  s pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale  just to make it feel a little better  br    br   the films final journey  in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north  reminds me of melville  s eerie man whale connection  and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion  where these two husbands might connect  understand even respect each other in their own grief  for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident  it  s clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss  however  it never goes there  the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone  br    br   the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an oversight  fails to chomp up the whale hugger  tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier   i love animals  and i detest whaling  and what is more i love orca whales  but if this film  s goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed  nolan shows compassion and growth  and feels for others  and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming  br    br   the only message one can walk away with is   if you see an orca whale  ever  anywhere  run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way  he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you             why  o   why     did i pick this one up  well    i needed a no brainer in the summer heat  and the cover looked cool  br    br   of course i should  ve known better  this is a really  really bad movie  and it gets embarasing when the makers know it  s bad  and try cover it up by adding some sexy beautiful women  and some sex scenes to it  well  folks    it does  nt cut it  does it  br    br   if you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very  very good  well played and funny  go rent lake placid   that is an order           only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb  the first difficulty faced by the submarine   seaview   is what appear to be chunks of  rock  falling down through the water and crashing into its hull  but it  s not rock  they  re under the north pole  it is ice  everybody  except possibly hitherto mentioned small children  and even some of them  know that ice floats  br    br   then  disaster strikes  that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire  no one knows how this happened  we are told  which is understandable  because it is utterly impossible for radiation to   catch fire    and even if it could  there is no air in space for it to burn  br    br   there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to  nd grade school textbooks when making a film  however  irwin allen manages to do it again and again  perhaps we are meant to focus on the   people   instead  which is pretty easy  as they are cardboard  br    br   the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub kiddie romp  much like later episodes of his   lost in space   tv series  the concept of which was swiped outright from writer ib melchior and then rushed into production  br    br   the sub looks pretty good  though  which is why this one gets a                 our teacher showed us this movie in first grade  i haven  t seen it since  i just watched the trailer though  does this look like a first grade movie to you  i don  t think so  i was so horrified by this movie  i could barely watch it  it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half  and then there was the boy with ketchup  i was freaked out by this film  now today  being     i probably would not feel that way  i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn  t see this movie  even though it  s pg  be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids  i don  t even remember what it was about  once was enough           a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro life and the other a destroyer of a demon  s seed  the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific  but  instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death  despite the title itself  being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning  this ridiculous plot twist with it  s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon  i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go  never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to   the end              scott menville is not casey kasem  that is the first  most important  and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and company  br    br   shaggy  s voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows  they  ve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original  br    br   i  m not sure what they  re on about yet with the villain angle  but it surely isn  t following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows  br    br   and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted  i like it  but it  s not real scooby doo type animation  but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me  this might  too  br    br   it  s worth a glance at    once    if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice  that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly  besides  i am trying not to be an inflexible  nitpicking fan  evolve or die  as the saying goes  we  ll see how it looks after two more episodes    by then i  ll have formed a much more solid opinion           i often wonder how movies like this even get made  and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them  br    br   with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along  adding twists and turns when he liked  no matter how ludicrous they were  the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as   jo sheena roy pehenti hai  wahee fashion hota hai   and   yeh versace hai madam    yeah right   br    br   every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped  acting was awful  constumes  lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran   locales  the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion   screenplay etc etc  just one word  rubbish  br    br   for those people who love hashmi and his movies  watch it  as for me  i  ll never get those two and a half hours back  the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent          this movie is an amazing comedy   the script is too funny   if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more  though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh   salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles  after      i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this          even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing  this is a thin story    and quite predictable at times    but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately  the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that    the rich   prince   will lose his fortune  br    br   nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it  s easy to get caught up in the clich  s  then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living  the ending is very predictable but satisfying  i also want to compliment the title writing  very witty and fun           uwe boll slips back in his film making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island  an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked  the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked  additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness  however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way  its as if he couldn  t be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away  additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life  i  m guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had  it really stinks  clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he  s ever learned about film gets flushed  the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i  ve ever seen  this isn  t that bad  but it is close simply because it should have been better  then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film  i  d take a pass unless it  s late at night and you  re catching it on cable           this video is so hilariously funny  it makes everything else br    br   by eddie murphy seem very disappointing  even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor  which just goes to show you how good this really is   to be honest  i don  t think that i  ve ever br    br   laughed at something as much as this  including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse  this show is amazing  although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long  plus its extended version beginning with m  but it didn  t bother me  see it  the funniest thing i  ve ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too           this film is dreadful  it has absolutely zero laughs  hebrew hammer  adam goldberg  sets out to save hannukah from evil santa  andy dick   perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot  in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise  while there are some  far and few  nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent  it is laboured  hackneyed and ultimately  mindlessly boring  this despite the fact that goldberg  dick and greer  hammer  s client love interest  all have quite considerable screen presence  despite being played for what might be described as whacky over the top gags  this film is consistently middle class middle of the road muck  do not waste    minutes of your life on this   note  the music was good              it  s amazing that such a cliche ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place  the characters are so weak  and the acting so uninspired  that it  s impossible to care about any of them   especially brooke shields  the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible  if you like this genre  you  d be better off renting   singles    or   bodies  rest   motion             i never watched the   next action hero   show  and until reading the other comments here  did not know that this movie was the   prize   from that competition  i was just flipping channels and came across this  and found myself watching  dare eagerly  all the way to the end  br    br   yes  the plot  s been done  the most dangerous game  etc   but i was hoping for  and almost received  the   gotcha     how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end  i think the high tech was overdone  gps  s  and gave me cold sweat flashbacks of night rider  but it nevertheless was not too overdone  br    br   the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod  suspension of disbelief  that was required of the viewer  do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate  could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up  pleeease  way too much of that type of thing   fun to watch  but keep it at least plausible  thank you very much  br    br   the final solution was good  but the ending was disappointing  with the after taste of a bad star trek episode  at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy   except for zane  who doesn  t get near as much work as he deserves imho   they were winners from a reality show  br    br   knock me out           i am a big fan of old horror movies  and since i am middle aged  old to me is a movie made before      with most being made in the       s to       s period  i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies  with one exception being creepshow    which i thought was great  i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook  and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending  all the stories were great though  so why did i like them so much  the characters had some decent development  the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad  the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear  and the funny bits were really funny  this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent  i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com  lol  when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it  s telling you something       of     also  romero  s expertise is hard to find here  they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard  i don  t know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me   and that  s not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on  it  s shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing  yuck yuck  to see it           i just wanted to say that  i love gheorghe muresan  so i automatically loved this movie  everything else about it was so so    billy crystal is a good actor  even if he is annoying  but the thing that made this movie was  at least  for a basketball fan  seeing gheorghe muresan act           i thought that this movie was incredible  i absolutely loved it  even though my brothers didn  t that much  the special effects were outstanding  and this movie is about my favorite sport  golf  the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row  this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen  it was everything i would expect out of a movie  i just loved it  also  it was pretty kid friendly  this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it  anything is possible  i would give it a pure        it was better than the legend of baggar vants  and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined  absolutely amazing  loved it           this is a funny film and i like it a lot  cary elwes plays robin hood to a tee  this is  of course  the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham  the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part  but still works well  a comedy for a night when you don  t want to have to think much  it  s well worth a rent           some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made  well  they are only partly right  for me  this is the worst movie ever made period  i have never seen anything so basely crude  and insulting  and vile  and against human nature as this film  a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry  this isn  t even so bad  its good  there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis   other bad movies like clambake  this one is so rotten to sit through its painful  pure garbage  native americans should sue for their poor clich  d and stereotypical treatment here  actually  perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole   stars  seriously  grade  f          first of all yes i  m white  so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race    anyway    white people hating black people   bad but black people hating white people   ok  because apparently we deserved it     where do i start  i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes  the infamous scene were ice cube and co  get in a fight with some really big  really strong  really really angry and scary looking neo nazis and win    the neo nazi where twice the size     and the chase  the chase is priceless    this is not a movie about race  tolerance and understanding  it doesn  t deliver    this is a racist movie that re affirm all the clich   stereotypes  the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead   cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it  br    br   save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written  poorly acted  dull and clearly biased picture  if you are into the subject  go and rent american history x  now thats a movie          donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film  that always sounds like a terrific plan  two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation  who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like   the flesh and the fiends   and   from beyond the grave    pairing up in a mid     s satanic themed exploitation flick  how can this possibly go wrong  well  unfortunately  it can  to my deepest regret   land of the minotaur   can hardly even be called mediocre  and that in spite of the cast  the exotic setting  the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise  in a remote little area in greece  more particularly near an archaeological site  multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire breathing minotaur statue  cushing  who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before  owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns  that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists  when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area  father roch   the priest of a couple of towns before    decides to investigate    land of the minotaur   is a boring and extremely slow paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn  t bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details  the titular minotaur  for example  is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person  but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance  instead  the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises  the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance  his portrayal of rude  bossy and old fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always           the three shorts included on this compilation issued in      are timeless chaplin classics  nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either  chaplin  s score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done  the problem with this compilation is a minor one  yet annoying  the shorts have been stretch printed to fit the    frame p s  speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at    frames p s  this results is jerky motion that doesn  t look very attractive  and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time  it  s just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored  the films look dirty as they did in      and are still stretch printed  there are separate restored versions of these classics available  even on dvd  and it would not be a problem to restore the image  but alas this has not been done  br    br   a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article  but i say again a minor quibble  it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating  the shorts are still worth                        s tourist trap is a clever  unique b thriller that stands out as one of the best of it  s kind  br    br   travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner  s mannequins are a little too life like for comfort  br    br   while the film has hints of the texas chainsaw massacre  tourist trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of the twilight zone  director david schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery  that reaches nightmarish proportions  also  schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings  br    br   venteran actor chuck connors is the best of the film  s decent cast  pino donaggio  s music score is excellent  having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie  a number of the film  s sequences are quite memorable  br    br   for horror and thriller fans alike  tourist trap is an unforgettable must see film  br    br           out of               years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me  the atmosphere of the movie was first class  the acting memorable and the storyline a classic  recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part   again i looked eagerly to viewing part         i was so pleased to realize early on into part   that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie  again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii          wrong   i wish i  d stopped at ii  the storyline was not good  it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story  the characters were weak especially the daughter  pacino  s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather   or    then scenes such as  corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir  the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset  the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting  where the   goodies   get away and everyone else is shot  daughter and  st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board  the pathetic shooting on the steps       corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes  a man of his intelligence and guile isn  t ready for an emergency      no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again  but i  ll watch       many times down the years           this little two person movie is actually much bigger than it looks  it has so many layers  i  ve watched it over and over  and always pick up on something new  i am amazed at the depth of the acting  and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star          uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young  the journalist on whose real life experiences this movie is based  the key word here is   based    how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom  br    br   sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york  where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it  this involves him selling out  and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity  however  they are not overdone  the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney  s misadventures  the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid  well meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart  moderately obnoxious skilled writer  this contradiction is never that much of an issue  because simon pegg  as sidney  projects likability too well  br    br   jeff bridges underplays sidney  s editor a little too effectively  and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney  s affections and  with regard to megan fox  who plays an airhead bimbo starlet   i can say only this  just say the word  miss fox  and i will leave my wife  sell all my belongings  and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort  of course  given that i  m a fat    year old english accountant  you might not find my offer too enticing  but it  s there on the table anyway  given how short her career has been so far  one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become  however  she does it sweetly  with some skill  and extremely sexily  this girl will go far  br    br   there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers   miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk  gillian anderson and danny huston from the us  br    br   there are several laugh out loud moments  and i smiled most of the way through  as ever  the f word makes appearances when it really doesn  t need to  although at least a couple of these are very funny           alien hunter    out of     is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell  new mexico suck  take alien mixed with the thing  mixed with contact  mixed with of all things on the beach  the andromeda strain  the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot   br    br   derivative doesn  t even begin to describe this movie  of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right  nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease   james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join him    he turns her down  aggh    br    br   in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it  i mean if your going to have impossibly good looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke  br    br   with about    seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci fi adventure  needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clich  d artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title   br    br   i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif   note that since jason of friday the   th fame  pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield   the characters in the cornfield dress like logan  s run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them  br    br   that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant  the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear  john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it  br    br   alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie           i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was  once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you    you are alone   is that movie  for me   the film is constantly in my head and in my heart  i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again  as if i am seeing it for the first time  br    br   there is nothing i did not like about the movie  amazing soundtrack    the ending was perfect  very emotionally stirring    it was compelling and riveting  br    br   i adored jessica bohl and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed  i admired brittany  s strength  what a strong woman   br    br   the tag line is   when your darkest moments come to life    we never know what we are capable of doing  everyone says oh i would never do that  when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation  we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject  the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part  br    br   thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art              i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie  not just because i  m a huge linnea quigley jill terashita fan  but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times  br    br   the special effects are awesome  especially linnea  s scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed  br    br   plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill  plenty of humor  cool soundtrack  high body count  etc   by the way  if you have never seen this one  try and buy watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing           i saw the film and i got screwed  because the film was foolish and boring  i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled   sholay    the cast and crew was bad  the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle  amithab bachan  s acting is poor  i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year sure  nobody did justice to their work  including ajay devagan  this film don  t deserve any audiences  i bet that this film will flop   br    br     finally this movie sucks            lorna green janine reynaud is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club  she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon  it  s quite possible that  through a form of hypnotic suggestion  someone   a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love making is about to begin  after the murders within her fantasies are committed  lorna awakens bewildered  often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality  br    br   if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco  i  d say it  s elegant   difficult  by now  you  ve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about  since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream  franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career  as far as film making style  and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience  and  as you read from the reaction of the user comments here  some like this decision  others find the style labouring  dull  and bewildering  i  ll be the first to admit that the film is over my head  but even franco himself  when quizzed by critics who watched   succubus    admitted that he didn  t even understand the film and he directed it  some might say that   succubus   was merely a precursor to his more admired work    venus in furs    considered his masterwork by franco faithful  because it also adopts the surreal  dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn  t truly know whether he she is experiencing something real or imagined  in a sense  like the protagonist  we are experiencing the same type of confusion  certainly    succubus   is unconventional film making where we aren  t given the keys to what is exactly going on  and  a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn  t help matters    succubus   is also populated by beatnik types and   poet speak    corman  s film    a bucket of blood   poked fun at  my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party  quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually  great locations and jazz score  i liked this film myself  although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction  loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna  a wee bit drunk  writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig   equally wasted rush her in an embrace of kisses           this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever  frank welker  welker makes the film  knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty  knotts works for a small   no where   town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials  when things go wrong the city fathers  allow knotts to take the fall  frank welker  s character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott  s good name  this film shows the usual knott  s scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film  this may have been knotts   last good outing  when you have an extra    minutes  get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon  don knotts           emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel  i have not read the book so i really didn  t know that much about the plot  and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot  there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing  the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it  of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny  gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma  the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better  ewan mecgreger who has also been better but he is still very good here  alan cumming who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here  and jeremy northam who  s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle  even if that was not what it needed  there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching           why do i hate this  let me list the ways  br    br   i have nothing against mary pickford but a    year old woman playing a    year old is just stupid  br    br   there  s a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it  s considered funny   and it goes on for    minutes  br    br   strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt br    br   the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs br    br   for a   family   film the fights were way too violent  loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy   and the humor was just stupid  br    br   seriously     minutes in i gave up and turned it off  the slurs  racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me  also there was no plot that i could see  the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era  br    br   just painful  avoid           thank god this wasn  t based on a true story  because what a story it is  populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds  before the devil is a mesmerizing  jaw dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable  and sometimes is  even with   or perhaps because of   the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout  if it weren  t carried out with such magnificent  overwhelming conviction by its stars  the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn  t hurt either  br    br   the main dysfunction here is of a family nature  with the two majorly screwed up brothers  brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke  deciding to rob their own parents   jewelry store  an attempt that goes pathetically awry  br    br   the story is told with time shifts  which are noted on screen  such as    charlie  two days before the robbery    so no one should be confused   some people have said they didn  t like this device but i thought it worked perfectly  adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair  considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks   between them you couldn  t make a decent poker hand to save your life  throw in these cheesy extra tidbits  one of the brothers is a drug addict  married to gina  marisa tomei  also excellent   who is having an affair with the other brother  toss in some monumental sibling rivalry  along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father  a wrenching performance from albert finney   who has apparently caused him serious past pain  and you  ve got a shakespearean greek tragedy on your hands  proceed with caution           if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives  this dvd delivers  you will learn new things guaranteed  so much so that you won  t need any other documentary  s on the subject  get this  watch it  learn from it  good for school use as well  as a bonus  watch this with tora tora tora  saving private ryan  patton  band of brothers  a bridge too far  the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete  sir laurence oliver  s voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this    part series  seriously you won  t find a better wwii documentary set on the subject  perfect                the movie was gripping from start to finish and its b w photography of the american heartland is stunning  we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again  near the end of the movie  the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face  in the end  we follow them up the stairway to their final moment   br    br   the two criminals  performed by robert blake and scott wilson  as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town  hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith  the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town  this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else  evil  even the most vile  is part of the human condition  these two delusional men kill an entire family  looking for a safe that isn  t there  once on the run  they start writing bad cheques  carving out a trail for the authorities  br    br   there are many fine supporting actors  i like john forsyth as the detective on the case  alvin dewey  also  will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney  br    br   i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through  having only caught it in short snatches  i did finally get to it after buying the dvd  the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seen  br    br   don  t miss this brilliant movie  to me  this is what great film making is all about           this is a great show with total freshness and innovation  that usual chair  couch for a woman  host  that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes  the same old jokes  the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer     probably the pattern of johnny carson  copied by one and all  latterman  leno  conan    daly  this show does not seem to have any of these  br    br   i fell in love with this show within the first    minutes and i am going to stick to it  though it  s too early to say that  this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project  and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest  i hope that this show will last long  br    br   returning back after months  i still love this show  and i love his self deprecating humor  for example  his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus  the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys  which  however  does not involve the usual monkeying of conan o  brien  for example  i know it  s a cardinal sin to be repelled by o  brien  s antics  but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness    br    br   i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it  ferensen  s spoof of trading spouses  and nanny     in an earlier episode  are hilarious  idiot paparazzi are fun  especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people  s pictures  and  if i am not mistaken  they start taking his pictures shouting   gary coleman    br    br   added on   th april        coming back once again  i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog  i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing  either way  it was funny as hell  br    br   i do not expect spike feresten to read these pages  but maybe he does  he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so  i would better write down my suggestion here for him  i would like him to do a full    minute show with crazy gideon  the star of late night tv commercial  i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike  s talk show  sing a song  and play guitar   do a skit in the line of snl  and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles  i know  crazy gideon may not be aware of this  but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la   br    br   god willing  br    br   returning back on   th july        someone wrote here that the people who praised spike  s talkshow must be bribed by spike  i confess that spike really bribed me  but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy crowford           it  s all about getting what you want when you want it  and the message of bluebeard  s eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for  until what you wish for wishes for you  br    br   most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn  t relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue  misogynistic pirates aside  cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it  learning only too late that it wasn  t what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert  through a twisted  in soul and in practice  business deal  he ends up marring buying her with the intent of bedding her  but she will have none of it  literally  and frustrates him at every turn  and corner  and room  and tourist attraction  br    br   the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you  re not accustomed to  and may not enjoy seeing  in either cooper or colbert  the whole reason i watched the film was because they are   likable   actors  and the whole point of this movie is that they  re unlikable people  or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves  they think  from the world   br    br   if you can accept it on its own terms you  ll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film   and satisfaction  as we said  is what it  s all about  such a movie with such a cast only comes around  after all  once in a   ummm   blue moon           now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i  m appalled  for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i  m afraid i don  t know what the world has come to  let me tell u something  i started watching many t v shows like lost  prison break  dexter  deadwood and even invasion  but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season  especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took   genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season  then we have the sopranos  i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season  and more importantly all of its episodes  there is no department that this show doesn  t excel in  acting  nothing short of superb  james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode  after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would  ve been the better choice  however after watching the first few episodes  i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony  the raw emotion he displays is superb  then we have everyone else  edie falco  michael imperioli  lorraine bracco  dominic chianese  whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part    and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie   walnuts   gualtieri and silvio dante  all of these actors perform to the best quality  and all giving an excellent performance in each episode  then we have the story  never have i been so sucked into a t v show before  the story is nothing short of excellent  each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic  i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of  its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence  but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television  and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show  not just say its too violent  or they feel that the character of tony is immoral  i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day  i don  t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god  i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me  you  ll be hooked from the very first episode  i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show  hooked on it  trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t v  after you  ve watched the first season  you  ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television  and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos           i  d give this a negative rating if i could  i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind  the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson  oh how original  if i were a    year old boy i might laugh at that  i have no idea how this movie became so popular  seriously the worst thing i  ve ever seen  i wasn  t entertained  it wasn  t funny i wasn  t even bored  i wasn  t anything  it wasn  t even so bad it was good  it  s just bad  ridiculous actually  please do not waste your money on this movie  don  t even rent this movie  no clue how it  s getting such a high rating           most people are totally unaware that this movie exists  fox  which paid judge to make it  has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it  i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer  well  i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe  basically  judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin  then these stupid are getting more stupid  by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex  which produces more stupid people  by       a person of average intelligence today  will appear to be a genius  that talks   all faggy    seriously  is this really that hard to believe  oh sure  this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid  but still plausible  luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy  hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time  where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one liners  like   can we family style her   and   hey man  i  m   bating here    this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure  comfort and stupidity  and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over           this is a great  ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late   s   obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was  i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid  it doesn  t help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown  s graveyard when i was ten  turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan  so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile  but i love it now  as a    year old  br    br   i bought this dvd used for   bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover  but to my surprise  it ruled  it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal  and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd  this movie is awesome  if you love   s metal and bad movies  this one  s for you                 while not quite as good as a murder is announced  which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book  this is an excellent adaptation  and you know what  it is a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version  now i don  t take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations  two or three of them were surprisingly good  but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script  a confusing final solution or both  the geraldine mcewan version suffered from a plodding pace  and both of the above problems  and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptations  worst being sittaford mystery  which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing  this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement  it not only respects the book  despite a few liberties  but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had  despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating  more to do with how he was written than how he was acted  and one or two moments of sluggish pacing  this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book  it is beautifully filmed  with nice photography and period detail  and the music as always is excellent  the performances are wonderful this time around  and make the most of an in general well done script  with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple  and solid turns from liz fraser  helen cherry  joanna hole and anna cropper  margaret tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as clothilde  overall  well worth watching  better than the recent version in pretty much all departments       bethany cox          good lord  what were they thinking         here is your spoiler warning  even though i don  t think it  ll really matter  you won  t be seeing this piece of trash anyway  br    br   a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people  who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them  and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies  in other words  the whole thing is really stupid  br    br   you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can  t save something   and they didn  t  i know  some of their lines were funny  like what to add to the sign   hit   and the hand comments  but  geez  this was pretty dang sad  br    br   all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud  it is not worth your eyes           i had heard  and read  so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series  like entourage  sopranos or mad men  but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one   didn  t make it past the first six episodes   br    br   the writing was unoriginal  contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing  the dialog felt forced  like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip   it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laugh  br    br   the characters never developed enough for me to care about them  they were selfish and unappealing  i absolutely hated the addition of the brother in law  who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator  and the removal of the hodes   daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clich    i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer  s loyalty  br    br   episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn  t get past many of the technical flaws in the story line  br    br   add to that i heard that season two wasn  t as good  so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out  br    br   if you  re a fan of good casting and writing  i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like  unless of course you  re stoned and then all bets are off           this movie is among my favorite foreign films  some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog  the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films  is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson   br    br   in japan  a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life  sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio  in the instant that it takes his train to pass  he is enthralled by her  but is it only by her beauty  by her faraway glance  or a connection that they will both discover that they share   br    br   shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance  breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society  they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away  it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and  in itself  transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be           as if the film were not of value in itself  this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it  in the summer of      i saw the film in nyc  that fall in graduate school  i read the book for the first time  some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film  and for better or worse  and i  ve now read and taught the novel for over three decades  milo o  shea is still leopold bloom           this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution  it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love   br    br   the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film  dreaming of julia makes much more sense  it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people  s daily lives and pursuits  that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban history  br    br   the excessive use of the voice over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could  br    br   the comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies  but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love   br    br   the revolution  like the film julie  never seems to have an ending           i saw zp when it was first released and found it a major disappointment  its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey     s  it  s politics too upfront and ridiculous  and let  s face it  i was still under a love spell known as blowup   and i still haven  t completely shaken it  now the   love   is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and  oh well       good luck to me  br    br   but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been a teacher to me  i revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age  and zp is it  s own   experience  and is only really linked to blowup through its creator  the late great mr  antonioni  br    br   twelve years ago  i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print  projected at its correct size  immense   restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape  to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared  it was like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness  and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of   place    br    br   what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own  br    br   i remember the second time around seeing it     the early   s     i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular  whereas  before these two seemed like a smart alecky shadow version of zefferelli  s olivia and leonard  read  romeo and juliet they now were engaging me     particularly the girl in her insistent slo motion ality  she took her time       to live  everything  everything dies around her  br    br   upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found   enjoyment    the encroaching shoulder padded  big haired   s whispered   but that  s a hippie fantasy     let it go   br    br   the force of antonioni  s vision had  i had realised  already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered     s   with an   uh huh   and guarded my   love   secretly  possessively and jealously  br    br   but  this  then is what good art does it lives inside of you  and  if you wish it has its way and   loves   you back  secretly  jealously  and possessively  and you get   changed    br    br   was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup  undoubtedly  zp must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment  but  hey  sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all  br    br   today reality hit  zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alice  s restaurant  br    br   so  it is still too   difficult    too   disturbing    too   what    br    br   maybe it  s that  as with all good art  it lives while everything dies around it   br    br   peace           very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story  but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice  gruesome make up effects  daniella is a beautiful twenty something girl  carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of     nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she  s the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf  she kills her brother in law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital  she escapes again  however  and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives  doctors and relatives  it  s all pretty to look at and listen too  really great soundtrack   but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast  luckily enough  leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire  the film is too long  too weird and too forgettable  the biggest surprise comes at the end  when suddenly and out of the blue  director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts  yeah  right             this is an interesting  hard to find movie from the early     s starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn  t make the cut as a marine  dressed in   baby blue   outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home  the failed recruits are sent packing  vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard core marine   raider    gere  s character is already jaded and contemplating desertion  and he takes advantage of vincent  s innocence  stealing his   baby blue   uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway  vincent  s character  whose name is marion  takes gere  s outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine   raider    marion hitch hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell like little town  in the local caf   he meets rose hudkins  who immediately catches his eye  staying with hudkins parents  marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks  mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine   raider   could still be so innocent  the story also brings up the japanese internment camps  as the towns folks go   hunting     escapees  marion is shot accidentally during this hunt  but there  s still a happy ending  which befuddled me a bit  i would have preferred a little more drama  anyway  this captures jmv at the peak of his     s performances  buster and billie  baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid     s were amazingly good jmv performances  he was both an action star and a heart throb all at the same time    he made a lot of quality movies during his career  and continued to do so up into the mid     s with the great tv show airwolf  he does a very good job in this as   hedge    quietly observing the way people treat him  in his uniform  as he travels across the country  he must have performed some of the stunt work as well  there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie and it looks like he  s the guy getting tossed down the river to me  but really  at the height of his popularity  this movie could have done so much more with jmv  s talent and his looks  innocence can only be so interesting  evil  as explored in   buster and billie    is much more dramatic  anyway  glynnis o  connor is delightful as rose  the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting  the outdoor scenes are gorgeous   must have been filmed in canada           johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories  the music is great  you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like  i  ve been there too   and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion  cash  s narration is good too  br    br   but     br    br      the actor who played jesus was miscast     there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music     because it is uncompelling  i doubt we  ll see this ever widely distributed again  br    br   i  d love to buy the cd  br    br   tom paine texas  usa          j  niksen vuosi is one of jarva  s most political movies  it takes stance strongly against modern day society  s authority status in the life of the common man  and how it has estranged men from the nature completely  it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society  br    br   vatanen  antti litja    smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations   tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland   only to realize that the concept of a   free country   isn  t all that unambiguous  in other words  the society has the common man by the balls  br    br   still the thing that makes j  niksen vuosi so exceptional   besides the visual and humouristic brilliance   is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the     s  as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation  vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness  since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns  the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes j  niksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving           i love jamie foxx  br    br   and i enjoy     of all movies i see  br    br   and i walked out of this one  br    br   now  i admit  it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing    oh no  jamie  s knocking on a door  hee hee hee      but    this was just so incredibly annoying  there could be no sustained camera shot  and no camera shot from a conventional angle    everything had to be in your face  loud  and annoying  br    br   the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich like  but at this point  it  s just old and tired  he brought nothing new or interesting  from all the characters  too many lines you saw coming  too many you  ve heard before  and too many   tough guy   lines    and i don  t mind that sort of thing  really  as long as there  s a bit of originality to it  in fact  pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked  br    br   i love jamie foxx  and i think he  s really funny  and i thought he was funny in this movie    but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else   br    br   this movie needed less shoot em up  less annoying camera shots  more emotion  more feeling  and more jamie foxx  i gave it a             after seeing dick tracy in the       bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies  i was very surprised to see a very fun  smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout  the movie moves along well  it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty  but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna  i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city  madonna was great as the damsel in distress  she really impressed me and added depth to her performance  if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun  smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try  i don  t think you will be disappointed  and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino  james caan  kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others          send them to the freezer  this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh  an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film  the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile   if you can stand it  definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive          wow  i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in   trainspotting    this is a phenomenal movie  it has action  romance  suspense  intrigue and wit  when i wasn  t laughing  i was at the edge of my seat  this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the   th century  this film has everything to keep me happy           i don  t know why some people criticise that show so much  br    br   it is a great  funny show   probably not the right material for mainstream prime time  but still    br    br   the family dynamics are funny  and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows  the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious  the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried   roy jibes are only just above average  but ever so often you have sub plots or one liners that make you roll on the floor laughing  br    br   this show was well worth the   pounds i paid for it  br    br   rating                mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna  erika fay  lives  her best friend is rosie  martine hughes    she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel  gabriel gutierrez  who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town  killing livestock   several residents including some of their friends  local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra  an evil creature from myth   legend  erm  i  m struggling now because not that much else actually happens    br    br   written   directed by scott maginnis i won  t beat about the bush here   simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful  period  the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once   the rest of the time it  s referred to a chupacabra  in fact i suspect this wasn  t really conceived as a werewolf flick at all  the   werewolf   creature looks mostly hairless   more like some vicious dog  there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon   it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions  there is no transformation scene   at the end when it is killed it doesn  t change back into anyone either  to be honest apart from the title there  s nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all   even then the title is just a rip off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london         this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre  how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead         the evil dead         halloween        or friday the   th        which were all made on shoe string budgets  maybe the blair witch project        but that  s it in recent years   crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic  the character  s are awful   things just happen around them  the dialogue is rubbish  the pacing is terrible  the story sucks   virtually sent me to sleep   as a whole this film is just crap  i  m sorry but i don  t know how else to describe it  br    br   director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable  there  s the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache   quick   blink   you  ll miss something   editing which just annoys   irritates in equal measure  it  s not scary  there  s no nudity  there  s no tension or atmosphere   the special effects are awful  the monster really does look poor   it  s no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it  there  s virtually no colour to the picture either  it  s either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well  the gore consists of some fake guts  blink   you  ll miss them    a few bloody wounds   a severed arm  big deal  br    br   with a supposed budget of about          i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film  there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far  the whole thing has the look of a home movie  it has no style   is throughly bland   dull to look at  the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that  br    br   mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting buying watching it because they might mistakenly think it  s a sequel to john landis   classic which it most certainly isn  t   it isn  t even a proper werewolf flick either  don  t be fooled this is awful   i  m fed up of having to waste time money on home made amateur crap like this           i found this to be a surprisingly light handed touch at a       s culture clash movie  john wayne would hardly be one  s first choice as a cultural attache  being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull run in harrods  but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona  and he accomplished his task with style  the duke was a guy who really could act well  his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle  br    br   despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time  he failed to dominate this movie  many of his good intentions came a cropper  he had authority over nobody  and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian  br    br   the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell for leather battles  i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well  there was a great deal of minutely choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props  the set pieces were complex and detailed  a lot of money and thought had been applied to it  br    br   the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element  and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag waving effort  script was good without being too wordy  there was a great deal of japanese dialogue  but the lengthy periods of translation didn  t interfere with the narrative  it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set  whether or not they were japanese  i couldn  t say  but anyway they looked the part  at least the leads were not played by cross dressing caucasians  unlike other efforts such as   blood alley    yes  i know they were chinese    the inn of the sixth happiness   or even   the king and i    br    br   frankly  i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies  the script was better for a start  i never liked the songs in   the king and i    and wasn  t impressed by the heavy laden anti communist subtext of   blood alley    i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke  s more popular outings  br    br   recommended           i was so glad i came across this short film  i  m always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across  so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards  i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for  br    br   the plot is pretty simple  the director  writer  and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals  the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy  br    br   it  s a well made short film  well edited and the actors all do a great job  and the last shot of the film is perfect  br    br   i highly recommend this film           i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one  but when i started with it i found it really awful  they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think     of the movie is shot in india  you can see indian made cars  you can see lars drinking bisleri an indian water brand   hindi written on the road  you can also see temples in afghanistan  hahah  its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan  i think one should not waste his her time watching this movie   pure time waste   i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don  t watch this waste of time          truly appalling waste of space  me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about    minutes from the end  and i can count the films i have switched off before the end on one hand  br    br   the script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring  i wouldn  t be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from       for example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone  i mean seriously  the police would be beating his door down in minutes  the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river  it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film  the narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters  oh and what   characters   they are  the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful  he could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed  after    or so minutes of the film i had built absolutely zero attachment to this character  he is neither sympathetic nor hateful  just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene  his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery  is he happy  is he sad  angry  no idea  just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh  and the native american theme is just awful and pointless  br    br   the good guys are at best unlikeable  a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex wife stereotype  cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy    you aren  t going to shoot me   that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying  br    br   the richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character  which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated  br    br   roasario dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown  you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourke  s  or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves  realistic female characters ftw   br    br   in summary a complete mess of a film  hopeless characterisations and performances  a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction  and ultimately extremely dull  its not even comedy bad either  laughing at rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first    turgid minutes of the film           in this movie  ch  vez supporters  either venezuelan and not venezuelan  just lie about a dramatic situation in our country   br    br   they did not say that the conflict started because of ch  vez announcement firing a lot of pdvsa best workers just for political issues  br    br   they did not say anything about more than    tv interruptions transmitted by ch  vez during only   days in   cadena nacional    a kind of confiscation o private tv signals   each one with about    minutes of duration  br    br   they did not tell us anything about the quiting announcement made by general en jefe lucas rincon romero  inspector general of the army forces  who is a traditional supporter of ch  vez  even now  in despite of his announcement  he is the ministro de interior y justicia  after ch  vez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa  equals to defense secretary in us   br    br   they did not say anything about ch  vez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections  br    br   they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by ch  vez supporters  either civilians and military official forces   br    br   they present some facts in a wrong order  in order to lie  br    br   they did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and ch  vez actions in order to avoid the elections  br    br   that  s why i tell you     this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie           one could wish that an idea as good as the   invisible man   would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects  but this is not the case  the story  the characters and  finally the entire last    minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early     s  there are some great moments  mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets  but alas  soon we  re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab  which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable  but schematic  br    br   there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past    years  and some of them have their charms  but it  s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol   classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven  who does have his moments  is a very bad one  it is obvious that the money is the key issue here  the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough  and as a result    hollow man   is seriously undermined with clich  s  sappy characters  predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever  br    br   however  the one thing that actually impressed me  beside the special effects  was the swearing  when making this kind of film  modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them  therefore  the language  and  sometimes  the violence and sex  is very toned down  when the whole world blows up  the good guys go   oh darn    and   oh my god      hollow man   gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them  i  m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear   but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears  i think we can thank verhoeven for that           ok  so it owes pulp fiction  but in my opinion has it  s own voice and identity mainly because of the music video direction style  sketch like narrative and great performances  thomas jane delivers great  the drug dealer show down is extraordinary   aaron eckhart likewise  james legros has a short and effervescent appearance great humor   they got the wong house    the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable  as is mickey rourke  s cameo appearance   take a peak    br    br   great hollywood popcorn b production with strong performances of a level aspirants and renegades rourke   br    br   well  take a peak  it  s worth           as far as i know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal  i  d agree with him  this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy man with a special body part helping him  oscar and bafta winning  and golden globe nominated daniel day lewis plays christy browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor  in a wheelchair and carried by his family  he has a special left foot though  he can write with it  paint with it and hold things with it  he learns to speak later in the film  it is very good for a guy like him  also starring home alone    s oscar winning  and golden globe nominated brenda fricker as mrs  brown and bafta winning ray mcanally as mr  brown  it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan  best writing  screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture  it was nominated the baftas for best film  best make up artist and best adapted screenplay  daniel day lewis was number    on the     greatest movie stars  he was number    on the    greatest british actors  he was number   on britain  s finest actors  and he was number    on the world  s greatest actor  and the film was number    on the    greatest british films  outstanding           all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes  and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance  but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better  all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future  and there wasn  t  i  ll admit to not finishing the film  i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get  and i quote    more tail than any man in the past time    i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself  but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested  and they failed  this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance  instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be like and i  m not against lesbians  thank you mr  director  someone please give me a redeeming quality    wait i have it  there  s no sequel           i do regret that i have bought this series  i expected more action  more objective picture and more consistency  this is just a pure propaganda series  very dark  without any charm  or romanticism  it is just boredom itself  i find the actors work quite weak as well  o  donnell might seem charming as robin  with batman   but in this picture he lacks any charm  probably while he becomes older  he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up  it comes as no surprise  that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for     of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands           the story has been told before  a deadly disease is spreading around    but the extra in this film is peter weller  his interpretation of muller on the run is real  he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child  this person could be working next to you           this film was very well advertised  i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months  while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be  my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it  then i went and saw it  i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie  i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in  plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie  i always go into a movie with an open mind  not trying to go into them with too many expectations  but this movie was not that funny  now it wasnt the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo  if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it  but for true comedy fans id say pass  maybe even check out the kings of comedy again  something told me to go see meet the parents instead             as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies  it  s such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture  too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world  i can only hope that people watch this by accident  by recommendation or other    br    br   because it  s really worth while  i left the cinema feeling really sad  i couldn  t get the tragic destiny  s of the characters out of my head  and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film  not only was it a tragic story  it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack  br    br   if you have the opportunity  watch it  it  s really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot  br    br             very typical almod  var of the time and  in its own way  no less funny than many of his later works  and why is that  there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about  and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional  no  the great humor stems from an underlying  almost surreal  absurdity that is woven into the scenery  the characters   nearly complete lack of taboo  it  s the same kind of   comic suspense   you find in his later works  though you  ll find it in a more rough version here  he  s building up for masterpieces to come  but is not yet there  br    br   the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did  claimed that it had to be a   very select   group of people who  d find this movie hilarious  i do           once again  doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load  it has humour    you  re just making it up as you go along      yup  but i do it brilliantly     action  monsters  in this case still more kick ass cybermen   tragedy and scare tactics  in short  just what the doctor ordered  pun intended   the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of   get on with it    so  chalk up   out of the last   episodes that have made you laugh  then made you cry  and made you go   eek    br    br   in terms of character development  this is clearly the clincher for noel clarke  s mickey  and ricky   being one of the doctor  s companions  you know that he will do the right thing  and may even suspect the manner that he does it  however  it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path  br    br   while   the rise of the cybermen   had more of the sinister build up to terror    the age of steel   is an all out blast  like   alien   compared to   aliens     both true classics  but in different ways  can the series keep it up at this level  let  s hope so           a brother  s promise is a wonderful family film  this is a biography of dan jansen  a champion olympic speed skater  the movie depicts this athlete  s life from a young age through full adulthood  the love and support of the family members is evident throughout  how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us  the commitment and determination of dan  s coach and his teammates  shows what it takes to make a real team  how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating  the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives  this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age           well   now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his   house of       corpses   crapfest  i can now rest in peace  nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in   the house of seven corpses    but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot  ha   anyway  to kill the bloody amateurs making a low rent horror flick in his former abode  in hell house  sorry  i don  t remember the actual name of the residence   a bunch of mysterious  unexplained deaths took place long ago  some  like arthritic lurch stand in john carradine  whose small role provides the film  s only worthwhile moments   attribute it to the supernatural  bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum  the result comes across like   satan  s school for girls    catchy title  made for tv production values  intriguing plot  crossed with   children shouldn  t play with dead things    low rent movie about low rent movie makers who wake the dead   trouble is  it  s nowhere near as entertaining or fun    the house of seven corpses   is dead at frame one  and spends the rest of its    minutes going through rigor mortis  dragging us along for every aching second             director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces like network dog day afternoon or serpico but he was not having too much luck on his most recent works gloria        was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting but failed experiment now lumet brings his best film in decades and by my point of view a true masterpiece before the devil knows you  re dead i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet this movie has an excellent story which deeply has many layers also i think the ending of the movie is perfect the performances are brilliant philip seymour hoffman brings as usual a magnificent performance and he  s no doubt one of the best actors of our days ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he  s underrated by my point of view his performance in here is great the rest of the cast is also excellent specially the great albert finney  but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars the film has a good level of intensity in part thanks to the performances and in part thanks to the brilliant screenplay before the devil knows you  re dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction a great screenplay and excellent performances we need more movies like this           i took my    year old to see this movie  we left after    or    minutes  it was absolutely awful  this movie should be rated r at the least  i am not that strict with movies but  this was just too much  it was a waste of money  i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but  this was way beyond crude  i was sitting there watching and reading  a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me  and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was  i could not believe that it would be ok for a    year old to read and see this content  i don  t understand how the rating system works             i loved this film  i thought it would be easy to watch  and easy to forget  i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd  obv not easily forgotten  br    br   the script is brilliant  and the casting couldn  t be more perfect  each character has their moment  and i laughed hard throughout this film  comedic timing was spot on  br    br             it  s not easy to find judas kiss on vhs  it  s not available on dvd   but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection  br    br   i can  t understand how the talented mr  rickman gets into these mediocre films  judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors  an interesting plot and intriguing twists  but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama  many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character  s actions  why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses  why did he mistrust the detective he replaced  there were times when i honestly couldn  t tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof  why else would he toss in a topless alien lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes  that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby    did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors  alan rickman and emma thompson  to use such awful new orlean  s accents  as an alan freak  i confess that i still thought mr  rickman was sexy  in a rumpled  weary    take him home and tuck him in   sort of way  br    br   judas kiss isn  t a great movie  but it does have some intriguing moments  but i don  t recommend it unless you  re trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman           first of all  i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary  not only it had great music in it  but the shots and the editing were also wonderful  however  all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist   east meets west   clich   that bothers many turks like myself  okay  this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing  something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds  however  the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as   east   from the eyes of the   west    i mean  like one jazz musician says in the film  maybe there is no east and west  maybe it is just a myth  a lie created by the ruling leaders of   western   countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and   keep the cash flowing     br    br   why don  t you think about that           stmd  is not a terrible movie  but it is quite forgettable  the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest  so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye strain  special effects are imaginative  but obvious  the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there  of course  along with the archetypical teenagers  but the whole movie just doesn  t gel  what was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue in cheek humor  br    br   i can  t really recommend that you use your time watching this movie  i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor  but these are sadly lacking in this film           first off  i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen  its not even the low budget sci fi channel movie  its just awful  me and my friend who love action movies  independence day  jurassic park  lotr  etc  went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons  mindless entertainment  all we got was a mindless hour and a half  the cg was not as bad as i was expecting  but the plot is so awful along with the acting  it made up for it  its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every     years   sounds like a good remake of rain of fire  no  the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes  but with magic  and a very small actual war between dragons rather big snakes  it just gets ridiculous  the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail  me and my friend laughed through the whole thing along with all   of the audience   and cant believed we spent money on this  the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest  i  ve seen a lot of b movies like reptilian  the cave  spider  and others  but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour  watch this  br    br   story       cg       acting      br    br   i don  t drink   but it would have helped before watching this movie          i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie  but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie  the character of gust played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman  was one of the most unique  yet entertaining characters in recent memory  this movie informed yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience  it made me laugh  made me sad  made me feel alive  and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie  it takes no time to understand what is going on  and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine  human emotion  i thought i knew my history  apparently i didn  t know it at all  i give this move   out of     and recommend it for all adults  and young adults  and the young at heart  just not the young  but as soon as they are allowed to see   r   rated movies  make it a priority           i must have seen this a dozen times over the years  i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b   w on the local pbs station  br    br   i bought a dvd set for the children to see  and am making them watch it  they don  t teach history in school  and this explains the most critical event of the   th century  it expands their critical thinking  br    br   impartially  with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why  it details what lead up to the war and the actual war  br    br   buy it for your children  along with alistair cooke  s america  watch it with them  and make them understand  you  ll be so glad you did           steven seagal  s films of late have not exactly been good  but this is by far the worst since the patriot  the plot makes no sense what so ever  it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are  who works for who or who is double crossing who  the film is completely disjointed  each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward  even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow  most of the blame must lie at the director  s feet for not even understanding the basics of film making  but seagal does not get off lightly  as one of the producers of this film  he must also share the blame  oh  and i haven  t even mentioned how awful the acting is  even by seagal standards  even as straight to video fodder  this is not worth a view even for seagal fans  give it a wide berth           and i for one think that is a good thing  i  ve just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie  but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this  br    br   as for the rest of the production  i think it was slightly less than the original movie  one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails on the blackboard voice belting out   hey  it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah    and although i missed it  i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy  br    br   i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage  it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre  not just at the movies  br    br   i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song   let me entertain you    which becomes completely annoying after about the  th time you hear it           so real and surreal  all in one  i remember feeling like tessa  heck  i remember being tessa  this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending  i especially liked the protesters tangent  it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it  if you get the chance to see this  take it  it is well worth the    minutes           thank god i watched this at a friend  s place and did not pay for it  the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show  if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics  watch out  you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence   br    br   also  actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen  excluding porn  she  s lucky that matt lanter is actually decent  he  s the one that carries the movie   br    br   i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie  it  s a shame that they got to call it a sequel  because i was a fan of the original  which was actually pretty good           a friend lent me this dvd  which he got from the director at a festival  i think  i went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great  so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i liked this movie  br    br   the standouts where the actors  youssef kerkor was really good as ernie  the main character  kind of pathetic in a likable way  adam jones  who also directed  and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad  the bill character  justin lane   who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda  was by far my favorite  he seemed the least one dimensional  and reminded me of an old college roommate so much i called the guy after watching the dvd  really kind of lovable  and very funny  some of the other acting was good  some was so so  but none of it was bad  i also really liked the vigilante duo  ridiculous and funny  br    br   i  m giving this one high marks  even though it has some issues  because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared  and decided to make their movie their way  well done to adam jones and crew           shawshank  godfather  pulp fiction    all good films  great films  but nothing  and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all  santa claus  br    br   the film is so great and has so many messages  i cried while watching it  seriously  this is one of those movies you need to watch    times  when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream  we see the sadness in his eyes  and we feel the deep sorrow  and then we wonder    what is so bad about this ice cream  is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil  think movie makes you think  br    br   this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever  unlike other santas  he is a normal person  we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams  and we wonder  is the santa we believe in really that good  also  this santa actually mentions christ  the whole meaning behind christmas  br    br   you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece  we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic       whether it  s christmas or not  this movie gets a         whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool          i really cant think of anything good to say about this film   not a single thing  the script is a nightmare   the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference  you d think they would at least get a technical advisor  the performances were bad by most of the cast    although i dont really blame them   the material really stinks  the editing was equally bad   i ll just stop now   its all bad              cinema  s greatest period started in post war europe with italy  s neo realist movement  during the next   or   decades that followed  france  s new wavers caught everyone  s attention  and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere  making bitter masterpieces  but in       luchino visconti brought the art form to full circle  geographically speaking  with his miraculous work  death in venice   which might as well be called  the death of europoean cinema   after the sixties wound down  so did the great european filmmakers  who  with some exceptions  generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats  coppola  scorsese    co    this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing up  not just of visconti  s particular obsessions  but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies  and rest assured  you will find no sterner task master than the visconti revealed here  he  s not playing to the crowd  folks  either you get behind him and follow along  or you get left behind  the pacing is a challenge  slow  but never without emotional weight    incidents   are few and far between  but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm und drang cosmos  br    br   we will probably never be in such rarefied company again  in terms of the movies  one of the century  s great writers who inspired the tale  thomas mann   one of the greatest filmmakers directing it  visconti   one of the greatest actors in the lead role  dirk bogarde   and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background  gustav mahler  s  th symphony  taking full advantage of mahler  s ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast  visconti changes the main character  aschenbach  into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer  even making bogarde up to look like mahler  geeky mustache  specs  shaggy hair  duck like walk   bogarde  by the way  delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies  it  s a largely silent performance  and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance    a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse  br    br   cinema just doesn  t get better than this  i  ll ignore the complaints from the ritalin addicts out there who say that it  s too slow  but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbach  s flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced  the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie  s thematic concerns  i e   which is the better path to aesthetic perfection  passion or discipline    and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers   of course  some viewers will sleep through this movie  anyway   a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful  dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture  but this movie is actually about something  and what it  s mostly about is suffering  romantic  capital r  suffering  in particular  as a suffering romantic himself  visconti knew whereof he spoke  br    br    spoiler       i guess  if for nothing else  see  death in venice  for its portentous opening credits       and for its unforgettable ending  with bogarde  s jet black hair dye dripping off of his sweaty  dying head and onto his chalk white face  meanwhile  off in the distance  young tadzio  the object of bogarde  s dying desire  stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture  the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about  love  lust  beauty  loss  the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life  and cold death in the midst of warm  sunny beauty   death in venice  is a miraculous work of art   br    br    dvd tip  as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece  the damned   i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie  it  s ostensibly in english  but the dvd  s sound seems muddy and there  s a lot of italian spoken during the film  anyway    br    br             this is a stereotype plot  a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school  this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight  br    br   the fights are not of high standards  they are way too   simple   in a way that     is simple to every adult  the fighter has trained and enters the ring  but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking  the coach yells do this and do that with no success  and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once  this results in a turning point in the fight  although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point  think about the rocky movies and you  ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes  the fights are also shot poorly  br    br   there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance  cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment  br    br   these guys really could have made some quality entertainment  but the director wasn  t up to the task  or the other crew in my opinion  maybe they had a small budget  i don  t know  but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of   out of              this production was quite a surprise for me  i absolutely love obscure early   s movies  but i wasn  t prepared for the last    minutes of this story  if  by any chance  you  re not convinced in the first half  hang in there for the finale  of course  you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical  a fascinating viewing experience  but i think the cat  s paw is not available on video dvd yet  watch your pbs listings           it isn  t too bad  but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has  br    br   the jokes are few and far between  the actors are attractive  they shouldn  t be   the film makers think far too much about the cinematography  it  s supposed to look like a home video  and it  s just like a serious version of kath and kim    it  s stupid  br    br   it  s too normal to be kath and kim  kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy  middle aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes  there are no   look at me kimmy    jokes  the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she  s not even slightly stupid  she  s a stereotypical black latino chick  br    br   it  s just not as stupid or funny as the australian series  it doesn  t compare  nothing is the same  i admit  this show is pretty funny at times  but it is not anything like the aussie series  i was looking forward to an american take on a bogan family  they failed  it  s supposed to be really stupid and hilarious  but the actors don  t act stupid  to me  this is just a typical american tv show  it  s a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show  br    br     stars because it is an okay show  just nothing like what it should be           from the decrepit ranks of the already over saturated   hillybilly horror   sub genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks  sound familiar  well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre  there is absolutely new here  the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clich  s  deformed hicks  a peaceful family turned gun toting killers when push comes to show  the rebellious daughter  the one   freak   who  s good at heart  etcetera      but does even that half heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time  this is forgettable dreck  but humorously enough lead j d  hart once starred in a movie called   films that suck   earlier in his career  quite an ironic omen indeed  br    br   my grade  d           as a huge baseball fan  my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears  dennis quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher  it is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much   disney   for my taste           this film takes you on one family  s impossible journey  and makes you feel every step of their odyssey  beautifully acted and photographed  heartbreakingly real  its last line  with its wistful hope  is one of the more powerful in memory           stupid  stupid  stupid  i can not stand ben stiller anymore  how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me  i can  t understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i  d get fired and i own the company     i would have to fire myself  god  this movie was just a plain  steaming  stinking pile of poo  that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible  something else i have to say the guideline about    lines of text in a comment is idiotic  what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie  i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary           this show is great for many reasons  the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age  its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family  i watched this one time and became hooked it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching  this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy  sexy  drugs  bad dates death etc  the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way  great show for the family   i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off  great pg    rated show i loved everybit of this show           this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped  though i will concede that the ideas behind   batman forever   were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director  as it turned out this was not to be the case  br    br   apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out  apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton  and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series  i fail to understand how   batman returns   can be considered at all disappointing  br    br   true  it is not quite the equal of the first film   though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in   batman    a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film  yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film  true to the way the batman was always meant to be  and highly satisfying  br    br   michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne  tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck  christopher walken  named in honour of the     s german silent actor   his partner in crime oswald cobblepot  the penguin  danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier  s   richard iii     and selina kyle  the catwoman  michelle pfeiffer   whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman  the four principals turn in excellent performances  especially walken and devito  while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities  br    br   there are some intriguing concepts in this film  about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places  which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four cornered fight  there simply isn  t enough time to properly explore what  s going on  br    br   nevertheless  this is a damn good film  i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first  and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton           the quick and the undead is  finally  the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void  it is  essentially  one gigantic plot hole  br    br   aside from that  the acting was quite bad  character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn  t a single character worth hanging our hat on  the most interesting cast member  who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist  got snuffed halfway through the proceedings  br    br   what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color timing  it looked excellent  when you take into account budget considerations  br    br   unfortunately  it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns  most notably the good  the bad and the ugly  and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie      you know  they have movies where characters do this  does it fit here  no  but who cares  they do it in other movies so i should do it here     br    br   maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists  first year film schoolers   otherwise  a must miss           i was stunned by this film  afterwards  i didn  t even want to see any films for a long time  any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison  br    br   for many  it may be the worst of antonioni  very slow  without an engaging conventional story line  microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions  and the worst of wenders  verbose  confused transcendentalism  it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders   typical meandering hero  s stream of consciousness  so it doesn  t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema  br    br   but for fans  the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film  wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things  br    br             am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces  a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera  by the time he returns  still no senior cops  socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie   this is new york isn  t it    it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence  only after she  d stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene  br    br   i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images   the horror continues   not in the film itself  pretty ordinary i  m afraid  but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington  this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who  instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners  entrusts the work to an untrained cop  a rookie cop  who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible  now that was a bright idea eh  i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable  br    br   i have given this film      for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie  s lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended           the one of the most remarkable sci fi movies of the millennium  not only a movie but an incredible future vision  this movie establishes a new standard of s f movies  hail and kill           this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i  ve seen in full  the first was rope  which i really enjoyed  with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free  whereas rope took place all in one room  i didn  t enjoy this one as much as rope but that  s not saying this is a bad film  it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more  br    br   it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones  as a thriller  i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states  the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension  the sound design is almost non existent  you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them  but the important things are missing  the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve  the need of music to amp of the tension  all missing  intentional no doubt  yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene  then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside  br    br   the film doesn  t feel like it should either  they are almost globe trotting from place to place  yet it feels more confined  the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving  br    br   the performances are there  but nothing amazing  everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page  the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work  the one stand out is otto kruger  who has that rich  ego  evil persona down pat  br    br   in the end  i wanted more from this one  i understand it  s one of hitchcock  s least exciting films  but i did have a good time watching it  i can recommend it  just not enthusiastically           it is always difficult to bring a     pages book down to a three hours film  i read the book before  and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible  the qualities of the book haven  t been lost  the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the     s  the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up  the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking  the unexpected and surprising twists of the story  the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue  s point of view then from maud  s one  the main actors do very good  and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed  with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other  because they still love each other  br    br   for each of her books the author  sarah waters  has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british   th century  while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements  in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits  in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research  this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth  i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere  vivid emotions  and suspense           this is one of my all time favorite cheap  corny  vampire b movies   br    br   calvin klein underwear model   oh  i mean  stefan the good vampire  returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty  but manicure impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans  having killed their father the vampire king  radu now sets his sights on stefan  stefan  s new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends  and the all powerful bloodstone  br    br   okay  the scenery is beautiful  and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl fricken vania for gosh sakes  the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker  but who cares  there  s only one reason to watch this movie  and his name is radu  he  s a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie  all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day  the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film  as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning  slobbering face for the world to see  i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother  but maybe i  m just a sicko  questionable taste in men aside  i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts  it  s original  it  s fun  and radu is one of the best vampires i  ve seen in a long time   much more fun than the stiff  tragic  whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days  radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes  he  s what a vampire should be           let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts  and i do indeed know they exist  i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there  br    br   what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this  people forget there is more than one   bible    thousands of religions and beliefs  and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible  not everyone believes in god  and not everyone believes in stereo typical religion   br    br   religion does not make everything fact  one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within    you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time  slavery is ok  and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances  none of this    oh that was the old testament  and now we have the new testament    if the bible is the word of god  and cannot be changed  there should be no changes  or versions  religion is full of misinterpretations  mixed facts  and people who so blindly follow it that there    is no other way    the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic  or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly  and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher   br    br   but anyhow  onto the review  i am a decent fan of   ghost hunters   and when i heard this show was coming soon  i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential  as much as i like watching   ghost hunters    i do not like some of their members  and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted  yet cannot explain anything that is going on  just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up  does not mean the camera filming the show did not  i am glad they are skeptical  but it  s like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not  if ghosts were that easy to capture  it would be known as a fact  not a belief  it  s more of a   right place at the right time   kind of thing  as well as if there is something there  what makes you think it  s going to   perform   for you  this show is kind of silly  it  s usually boring  and there is lots of talk  lots of psychics  yet hardly anything happens  the main guy  s filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to  or is basically not needed  br    br   also  the reliance on psychics is too abundant  as i believe very few of them are actually gifted  silvia brown is one i definitely believe in  but most are sometimes hard to believe  br    br   i really wanted to like this show  but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed           for a long time    the menagerie   was my favorite   star trek   episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by   city on the edge of forever    what i used to prefer about   menagerie   was that it  s more hard core star trek with this fascinating back story to the then current trek storyline  i still think it  s fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two part episode  though the   new   part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others  and us  to watch the pilot  the idea of spock being court martialed is a clever one  you can poke holes in the plot if you want  for instance  given the talosians   mind control abilities and captain pike  s condition  why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet  and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez    best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st  s only two parter           coen brothers wannabe from writer director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other  better  movies  yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching  robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist  ha ha  who goes on a killing spree in the desert  the film is unusual  but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience  it becomes alienating and off putting  with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating   an admittedly bravura finale  many quirky bits of business  and forster looking great in the nude  make this a curiosity item  nothing more  veteran movie director irvin kershner produced  and maybe should directed as well  could paul chart be a pseudonym         from               when it was released this film caused a sensation  i watched it and was thrilled  beautiful  usually young  naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography  his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie  today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed  the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes  all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses  actually is all there is  there is no real story  the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies  but they are not real creatures with a soul  actually nothing happens  it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills  and this gets so boring after a while  i even didn  t watch the whole thing the second time  for i fell vast asleep  that is all that remains of this masterpiece  it is a very good sleeping pill  and you will never become addicted to it  br    br   back then   out of     now   out of             largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman   employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren  s missing sister  br    br   despite its connection to the cannibal movie family  this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardona  s   guyana   crime of the century    lenzi clearly aims to exploit the  at that time  topical jonestown massacre  by depicting a rogue  self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania  played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov  leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion  with sister in toe  kerman   agren attempt to stop the rot  but after several failed coups  they end up fleeing into the   green inferno    only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites  br    br   one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies early eighties  where every new addition seemed to engage in a one upmanship contest with its predecessor  by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures  this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others  but with much less success  br    br   was it the so called   amazonian natives   who looked like they were bollywood rejects  this film was made on location in sri lanka   or the inept   decapitation   and   castration   scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in   cannibal holocaust    you can decide  without spoiling the conclusion  it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending  where all loose ends are resolved  most unsatisfying  br    br   as with the others  where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited  thankfully   the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks  unfortunately  the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk  that deal with the subject matter more convincingly  br    br   if there are any redeemable features at all  kerman is an affable if somewhat one dimensional leading man  and his bevy of scantily clad co stars  agren  lai and senatore  provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings           get smart should be titled get stupid  there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film  this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean  a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye  as for anne hathaway  what is she doing in this film  she  s a good actress but is just plain terrible  br    br   the writing is pathetically lame  there is not one funny  clever  or witty line  there is not one good sight gag  br    br   the directing is terrible  comedy relies on timing  someone should tell the director that  every line that is supposed to be funny  and isn  t  is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i  ve ever seen  br    br     stars          herculis puaro is  in general  a well established   hero   we know well from books and movies  this movie or this story don  t work and i felt its not agatha  s mistake  the cast isn  t good  the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures  the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything  even arab clothes  look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama  the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic  the scenes are  as said before  perfect and looking fake  the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond     woman in the iraqi desert   the   victim   is not likable          how can so many blundering decisions can be made  all that waste of resources its an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse a loose interpretation  are you kidding  it diminishes my regard for voight and coburn i hope they were paid well          this was by far the worst movie i  ve ever seen  and thats compared to alexander  fortress   and the new world  br    br   i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience  for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen  i didn  t think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age  i was wrong  while typing this message  i  ve thought of a good reason to buy this movie  a joke present at xmas  i  m blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it  thanks babe  br    br   be warned       a true shocker all round                if you  ve read mother night and enjoyed it so much  as i did  that you just have to see the movie  understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut  s writing   that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself  and that you can  t put a human mind on the screen  his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance  i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book  but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen  does this mean that the movie misses the mark  of course not  in my opinion  the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book  this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page   it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america  s true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense  i  ve seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut  s genius and loses grip on his own craft  i would not place this movie as one of the best i  ve seen  but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching  by taking vonnegut  s   voice   out of the movie  s narration or trying to insert it however it can  mother night tells his story brilliantly  and preserves the story  s fundamental lessons without confusion  distraction  or disappointment           this is one of the worst movies  i  ve ever seen  not only  that it is a comedy  which isn  t funny  but it  s also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects  br    br   the two   heroes   with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot  that they touched each others genitals all the time  but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal  by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the   heroes    which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their   joyful   lifestyle      but i hadn  t expect anything better by director michael   bully   herbig  who also made two not funny tv shows  a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf comedy movie  but erkan and stefan had been  just a little  better in some of their stand up programs  for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel  who is very beautiful to me           i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time   but dear gussie  whoever thought this script was worth producing  the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad  with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes  an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face  looks like a bad b movie from the     s             a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak  she was    and he was    when this movie was released  i think that the difference didn  t matter for a suspense drama like vertigo  but it does matter for a romantic comedy  we can easily understand  that is  why his character would be attracted to hers  but it  s less clear why hers would be attracted to his  br    br   still  the movie works as a light romantic fantasy  the scene where she stares at him across the cat  s head  with her dark painted on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring  is true magic  it  s a little jarring  therefore  when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building  and we see the age difference very sharply  as he embraces her  she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair  but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee           family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about  love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about  one man  daddy  has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity  the kids grow up one all be it  in the hard way  to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is  the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall  all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances  yes  i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent  this true to life is one which every young adult  and parent  would do well to see  although some will not realize it until they too are parents  a must see for those who care about their families           the only conceivable flaw of this film is it  s title   please stop comparing it to the first  i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first  if you haven  t seen the movie and are curious  totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this  there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own  this is a great exponent of screwy mid   s comedy  i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first  anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus  i maintain  the only reason this is in the imdb bottom     is because of its title  i usually hate movies like these  i e  adam sandler  will farrell  farrelly bros       but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically  i dunno  maybe it  s like a bad relationship i can  t get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure  either way  this is the single most underrated movie of the   s behind   the stunt man    br    br   robert stack  we love you                         salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives  we see them panhandling in a car of the underground  where their pitch to get donations is so lame  no one gives them anything  salva  who is a hardened petty criminal doesn  t even have any redeeming qualities  that is  until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next  religion and show business prove to be a winning combination  something that salva capitalizes on  br    br   he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo  salva shows he is a natural for the reality show  he transforms himself into a christ like figure who is an instant success in the program  espe  who is a no nonsense woman who is show  s producer  can  t escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention  ultimately  salva is the victim of his own success in the end  br    br   jordi molla  whose first directorial job this movie is  had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television  spain  which was vulnerable to these types of programs  has seen its share of the bizarre  which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience  br    br   the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film  mr  molla  like any actor who decides to direct his first feature  would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera  candela pena  a good actress  is one of the best reasons for watching the movie  juan carlos villedo  david gimenez cacho  franco francescoantonio  florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director           these kinda movies just don  t get the credit they deserve  this is my  nd all time favorite movie   stand by me being  st   the reason i watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin  i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me  everything in the movie is very exceptional  the script  the acting  the screenplay  i was on the edge of my seat     of the time  and if my mom wasn  t in the room i would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta  wil wheaton  died  i did not see that coming   at all   i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn  t real popular back in the     s  i was born a few years after it came out so  of course  i didn  t go see it in the theaters  but im sure i would have if i would have been alive  if any of my friends watched this  they would be like    uhh okay    but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this  if you haven  t seen this movie  or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb  this is the movie for you to watch           as a big time prince fan of the last three to four years  i really can  t believe i  ve only just got round to watching   purple rain    the brand new   disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it  wow  i was really looking forward to watching it  but i wasn  t prepared for just how electric it actually is  prince  s musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding   he really has the moves in this one  i am very familiar  from repeated listens  with the classic   purple rain   album and all its songs  but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics   like computer blue  the beautiful ones  when doves cry and purple rain itself  there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform  the closing songs baby i  m a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid   s  he  s overflowing    it blew me away  it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years  br    br   prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams   drive her to a lake  make her jump in  then drive off   absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight  br    br   some of the scenes are very     s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film  s overall charm  morris day is the coolest cat on the block  and hilarious   and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style   i love their dancing in this bit  and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid performance  br    br   i already can  t wait to watch it again  i really can  t  extras are terrific   particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre beverly hills cop admit he is a   prince groupie             a good ol   boy film is almost required to have moonshine  car chases  a storyline that has a vague resemblance to   plot   and at least one very pretty country gal  barefoot with short shorts and a low top  the pretty gal is here  dressed in designer jeans    but the redneck prerequisites stop there  jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff  he comes up way short  big john is big  but he isn  t convincing with the   bad   part of his moniker  bug eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades  ned beatty also does his part in a small role    but there is no story  it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film  cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment  perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme  you know the one  it was made famous by    jimmy dean           after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb  i was extremely pleased with the film  the film was dark  moving  the anger  the pain  the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon  br    br   i had initially expected to see many special effects  and like a lover  s caress  it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it  brian  i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects  you will go a long way  my friend  i will definitely be the president of your fan club  br    br   eric etebari  the best actor award  was the number one choice  you made jr  lopez look like a child compared to kasadya      br    br   overall  the acting  story line  the high quality filming and awesome effects  it was fantastic  i just wish it were longer  i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations           but it is kinda hilarious  at least if you grew up on weird al  like i did  it  s a mockumentary about his life and career  beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins  it  s uneven in places  but some of the segments are still very funny  particularly when he goes to japan  although it  s not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation  and he doesn  t find love however fleeting  he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life  br    br   perhaps weird al isn  t recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is  perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet  still  this is a funny movie           one of the two best films of the year  a well filmed  well written  well put together film with an outstanding cast  lau ching wan and his friends  dayo wong chi wa  anthony wong chau sun  francis ng chun yu  jordan chan siu chun  cheung man tat  had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances  theresa lee plays her comedic role well  though much like a female version of michael wong  her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers    and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes  something i haven  t done since    the fan boys took over alt asian movies and    john woo  s hardboiled  sure the ending was expected  but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members  highly enjoyable          i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november      with my boyfriend  we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving  it was very well directed with strong imagery  the visual effects were amazing   especially for a short  it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic  this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father  there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard  this leans towards the gothic feel  i would love to see this as a full feature film     carrie         why else would he do this to me  br    br   not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies  or even decent movies  i saw lois and clark  i am aware of just how      good   dean cain is  br    br   obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick  and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head  i will not call these spoilers as you can  t really spoil this movie any more than it already is  br    br   to begin with    why is that a fake helicopter  i mean    why  br    br   how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried  how hard would it have been to get either an american actor  or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren  t american  br    br   why are there   occasions when the movie gives us a slug line  we get helipad day and then mess hall day later on  and then that  s it  who cares about the timeline  to be honest  who cared about it even when they mentioned it  but i guess that  s beside the point  br    br   does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens  the answer is no  br    br   that dragon sure can walk down that hall  over  and over   and over    and over    br    br   who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history  it was straight out of scooby doo  oh  the dragon  s dead now   say  wanna get dinner  sure  but not at some chinese place    with dragon in the name   ah ha ha ha   ha ha ha   haha ha  i used to be superman  aha ha ha  ha ha  br    br   fade to black br    br   my god  it made me cringe it was so stupid  br    br   but never fear  even though the whole building exploded   and no one was left alive  for some reason there  s a second untouched  unmanned lab that survived pretty well  so they can make a sequel  hurray for us all  br    br             minimal script  minimal character development  minimal steady camera  maximum stretched scenes  maximum headache inducing jerky zooms  maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing  up until the time flashes on the screen of      pm  you can fast forward and miss nothing  since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing  to be fair  the movie does have some string music that was interesting  so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this  unfortunately that was not to be  and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief  forget about   trigger man    i know i am trying to    merk          a wonderful film ahead of its time  br    br   i think so  in the eighty  s it was all about winning  greed is good   remember that one   i have seen this film more that    times  to me this is a real desert island film  i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love  jessica tandy  and hume cronin  are simply wonderful also beverly d  angelo  beau bridges come in at a close second  don  t get me wrong there are many more great performance  s in this film  and it is also the way it is written that made it for me  and i hope you  a film that you will want to see over and over  i think tv shows like   northen exposure    and now   earl   owe a lot to this film  but remember it is not a tom cruise film          it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing  the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go  you shouldn t really decide to watch this based on my review or not  i saw so little of it i shouldn t even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it  br    br   couldn t they have just made earnest does dallas         this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen  br    br   casting  richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore  diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself  supporting cast not too memorable  br    br   story  the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting  the story is weak   not enough happens to make a movie about  there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here   br    br   the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive   br    br   not destined to be a great one to remember           only light spoilers in here  br    br   stealing sinatra is a half slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers  dimwit victims  and a few other side stories thrown in to eat up some time  br    br   you will see some poor performances all around in this movie  the drama is forced  and the humor makes no sense  whether you  re watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won  t shut up  or a victim  s father responding to the criminal  s death threat with   care for some tea     none of it is believable  this quite comfortably fits into the   wannabe movie   category  br    br   you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie  it  s quite unprofessional  and adds nothing  it  s really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty  br    br   however  if you  re able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief  you might be entertained by the adequate storyline  br    br   i voted                yes  this is one of those movies  so terrible  so insipid  so trite  that you will not be able to stop laughing  i have watched comedies  good comedies  and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie  the other comments give the idea well enough  the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on  the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge  the acting   oh the acting   talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses  br    br   but the rat  yes  the big rat  why we didn  t get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me  often the   big one   isn  t shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money  i surmise  however  that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third world dentistry  br    br   the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene  after figuring out that the rats couldn  t stand loud noise  migraines from the bad acting    the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy  if you  ve ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser  this film is for you  really  you need to rent it and see for yourself  br    br   but not for more than       ok           well where do i begin my story   i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it  and that it was supposed to be a horror movie  br    br   well i figured out within the first    minutes  what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie  the plot was crap  and so was the script  the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically  br    br   the cast couldn  t have been more plastic looking  even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker   like they dragged on for no particular reason  very poor editing  br    br   all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money  boo           this is one of my favorites  betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy  one is a business executive who re evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year  the other is a playboy who has tired of gold digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital  mature woman  if you  ve got silver in your hair and or romance in your heart  microwave the popcorn  curl up with your honey  and prepare yourself for a treat           following directly from where the story left off in part one  the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man  s legacy is exactly as such  in direct contrast to the first feature  part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country  to che  struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties  the change of setting isn  t just aesthetic  from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature  replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical  battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle  yet  as che would go on to say himself  such a struggle is best told exactly as that  a struggle  while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that  part two takes a much more refined  callous and bleak segment of che  s life and ambition  and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible  easy to grasp manner  br    br   while the movie  s tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however  there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible  this somewhat distant  cold approach to telling che  s story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off  indeed  i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man  if anything  the entirety of che  taken as a whole  delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man  s struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way  by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago  excuse the ironic contrast   che is a slow moving  reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who   arguably  conducted the whole thing  br    br   yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak  decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two  the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn  t feel too disjointed from its predecessor  but does enough to give it its own reference points  here  the basic structure of part one is echoed back  there  s the initial struggle  the battles  the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them  all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement  yet  as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know  part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming  and disquieting note  this difference  in combination with the similarities to part one  make a compelling and memorable whole  by all means  both could be digested one their own  and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such  and enjoyed as they are  but taken as one statement  che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve  br    br   indeed  everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building  realistically structured combat scenes  the drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible  but with a feature such as this  part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don  t necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged  in fact  upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one  and title the review as a whole  yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively  br    br   with that said  i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime  but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part  s ability to do just that  with a reflective  intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie  s characters without drawing attention to themselves  che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor  but this time with a tragic but uplifting  reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film  br    br     a review by jamie robert ward  http   www invocus net           sometimes it  s hard to be a pirate               but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying   and it shows particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard  mr thomas gomez   eminently hissable when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face  with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male   dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m tourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time  it was an exciting entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions hidden meanings or alternative agenda it was fun  m louis jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest  mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun  but it is miss peters who stays in the memory wilfully adolescent illiterate tough but vulnerable wonderfully agile and ultimately courageous she is everybody  s idea of a lady pirate  there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles   that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret           i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago  when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema  which i found interesting  to put it diplomatically  but not so special  i instantly wanted to see more of his work  since then  i tried   with an emphasis on tried   watching his other work  shadows in particular  i must admit  it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film  at first the unpolished  raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot  put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original   absolutely   but flawed and dated experiment  but now  upon reviewing  these little imperfections make it look so fresh  even today  br    br   shot on a minimal budget of         with a skeleton six person crew  shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african american family in which two of the three siblings  ben  ben carruthers  and lelia  lelia goldoni   are light skinned and able to pass for white  cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones  cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing  a reaction against   seamless   hollywood production values  cassavetes main inspiration   at least in the cinematic style the film was shot   were the italian neo realists whilst also professing admiration for welles   pioneering spirit  the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neo realist directors  but with his bebop score by charles mingus ans shafi hadi  the film feels very different  very american  unlike anything made before really   br    br   the song with the feathered girls    i feel like a lolly pop    or something  feels like light years back to me  ancient history  but no matter how dated it might look  it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today  i think it  s this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film  without hollywood  improvised and without a real budget  seymour cassel  who acted and was involved in shadows  claims it was jules dassin  s the naked city        that was the first and inspired them all  but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers  br    br   camera obscura                   based on an actual story  john boorman shows the struggle of an american doctor  whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss  a holiday to burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all  but when her passport was stolen in rangoon  she could not leave the country with her sister  and was forced to stay back until she could get i d  papers from the american embassy  to fill in a day before she could fly out  she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide    i tried finding something in those stone statues  but nothing stirred in me  i was stone myself     br    br   suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt  just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train  she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot  in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him  with no thought of herself  continually her life was in danger   br    br   here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous  selfless charity  risking her life to save another  patricia arquette is beautiful  and not just to look at  she has a beautiful heart  this is an unforgettable story   br    br     we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps             this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say    enough already    of course  it isn  t nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in    minutes  eric phillips  don wilson  is an undercover cop in the near future  when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look a like cyborg  it is up to eric to clear her name  wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger  why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me  being a pm production  there are tons of car chases  exploding cars    in the first   minutes   and shoot outs  i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck  my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don  s simulator  it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa                shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho   i  m leaning toward rip off   after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better  almost to the point of being original  bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story  but the film already surpasses many in the   yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks   genre because it is actually shot in the south  br    br   a group of college girls

to yankees  do not wander off into the woods when in the south  not because you might witness a murder  but you may run across a marijuana plantation   this is the point where the story  not the movie  actually comes close to being good  br    br   while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech  his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do  tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i  ve seen since walton goggins  deputy steve naish  in house of      corpses  br    br   a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention  the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out  sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her  br    br   and in the strangest scene  sheriff dean makes like he  s about to rape patty  carol cadby  and tells her to take off her clothes  dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he  s about to do  the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible  his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ  i feel sorry for this preacher  s flock  jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven           although this film has had a lot of praise  i personally found it boring  there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable  but the story of how they interrelate  even if very unusual by our standards  is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long  the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first  as the tolerance of the various men is stretched  we see their characters develop  the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting  it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland  far from the city  but hardly exciting enough to keep one  s eyes open for           no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for   the house next door   from her     s novel of the same title  or someone else did it  this lifetime like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough  having read the book a long time ago  we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television  you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials  which of course  one can  t find in this version we watched  br    br   the film  s star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through  from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body  ms  boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy  the character at the center of the mystery  this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera  that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better  br    br   the film has a feeling of a cross between   desperate houswives   with   the stepford wives   and other better known features  combined with a mild dose of creepiness  the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting           meticulously constructed and perfectly played  to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age  br    br   based on william golding  s trilogy  these three    minute films chronicle

whole new world to discover           wow  this is really not that good   br    br   i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good    it is  but it is nothing special  br    br   the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies  br    br                   i have to point out  before you read this review  that in no way  is this a statement against iranian people     if you really want to read something into it  than hopefully you see  that i  m against politicians in general     but if you  re looking to be offended     i can  t help you  br    br   not in iran as this movie is banned there  see imdb trivia for this movie   which is a shame  because the movie is great  would it not be for   grbavica    this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin  br    br   rightfully so  it was the runner up  or second place if you will   why  because it is a movie about oppression  it  s not even that this is a complete women issue  it is about the government trying to keep the people down  an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie  but by banning it nothing is resolved and or can they make this movie disappear   br    br   another reviewer had a great summary line    comedy about a tragedy    that sums it up pretty well           i know little or nothing about astronomy  but nevertheless  i was  at first  a little sceptical about the plot of this movie  it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion  and thus  naturally  become ruthless serial killers  the plot does sound ridiculous at first  but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and  as you know  saturn is the emotion planet  it all falls into place  makes complete sense and it  s then that you know you aren  t simply watching another silly     s slasher with a pea brain plot  thank god for that  seriously  though  bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise  but it more than makes up for that with it  s originality  having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema  but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the   th clone   i know what i  d choose  br    br   also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it  s silly plot dug it into is the fact that it  s extremely entertaining  many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore  this film  however  keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids  which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned   a constant stream of sick humour and a small  but impressive for the type of film  dose of suspense and tension  one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry  there  s nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again  cough halloween cough   but that  s not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows  there wasn  t any room for a chainsaw  which is a huge shame  but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it           after many  many years i saw again this beautiful love story  thinking about how would i  half a century after  react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time  when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women  s behaviors  in a small city in brazil  br    br   this time  however  what caught my attention in the film was something very different  namely the insistence with which the physician dr  han suyin  jennifer jones  makes clear to the journalist mark elliott  william holden  her special ethically condition as an eurasian  in fact  she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship  repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a   occidental way    provided that  by doing so  she is not betraying her chinese side  its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture  for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them  br    br   therefore  suyin  s attitudes always leave poor elliott    a determined  brave and extremely practical man    anxious and perplexed  without knowing how much importance to give to her words  for him  whose love for her is plain and simple  the situation is totally clear  if we love each other  let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together    not so fast    is what she seems  verbally and non verbally  to answer him all the time  br    br   in fact  suyin  s chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism  and  as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself  she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind  namely the constant   raids   on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non physical world  for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life  not because of any objective and concrete threat  as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion   but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor  fearful and vulnerable human beings  br    br   in fact  it looks like a whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people  s life totally miserable  because of that  mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes  so that they are not taken away by jealous gods  everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away  in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon  peasants are advised that they should shout loudly   the rice is bad  the rice is bad    to protect their crops from being stolen by deities  and  in a funeral  it is recommended that the dead  s family be isolated from the other people by curtains  so that the gods don  t take advantage of their sorrow and fragility  br    br   in other words  suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence  as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone  s daily life  br    br   as the story takes place in hong kong in       it should be clear that china really was  at that time  almost a semi feudal society  while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that  launched by the usa after the first oil shock in       took charge of the whole world  therefore  at least in one aspect  both sides of suyin  s eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today  br    br   a lot of history came into being since those old days  as to china  the main fact is that  after several phases of a communist regime  the country finally reached  in the last two decades  the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism  and  what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong  in       and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott  under that tree on the hill behind the hospital  it is gone  completely gone  in brief  if that story took place today  elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family  in fact  both men would now be incomparably closer to one another  in their huge pragmatism  talking business as usual           first and foremost i would like to say  that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual  someone that cared about others  appreciated others  found no barely any judgment against other people  and this film has  i think  changed my life or viewpoint dramatically  when i watched it  i didn  t know particularly what it was about  i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship  but other then that i was clueless  and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters  i was in shock  disbelief  confusion and surprise  the first time i watched it  i was blind  blind to their love  to their intimacy  to their connection  to their pureness as human beings  to their relationship  i watched it a second time  because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being  saying to myself and others    oh i accept all types of people  and try not to judge them   while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story  because of my fear i suppose  the second time i watched this film  i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time  and really looked  not at the type of taboo relationship part that i  d heard about all my life  but simply at two human beings in love  and i loved it  i loved the storyline  i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film  i loved the sharing of feelings  and i loved the strong bonds created  it is a really eye opening  beautifully done film that made me cry at times  and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually  remember that everyone deserves love  no matter what shape or form it is presented in                zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz    if imdb would allow one word reviews  that  s what mine would be  this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film  the singing  the story  everything is dull and washed out  just like this public domain print  like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories  such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland   this movie has limited appeal and just doesn  t age well  now that i think about it  i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable  so my advice is don  t watch this film  if you must watch an abbott and costello film  almost any other one of their films  except for a c go to mars  would be an improvement           once in a while  a movie will sweep along that stuns you  draws you in  awes you  and  in the end  leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form  this is not it  this is an action movie that lacks convincing action  it stinks  rent something else           hard to imagine this film is based on a true story  and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring  daniel day lewis is a chameleon  really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character  watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience  br    br   the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before  the story is kinda bright and intriguing  christy is not despised by the normals  his life is also colorful and delightful  although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes  br    br   one important factor of christy  s success is his mother  s support which seems to be more touching  and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role  this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make christy  s dream come true  so lucky for christy and hugh o  conor is also excellent as young christy  what a performance for a child  the love story of christy is very well done  trustful  christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love  his crush on the beautiful dr  eileen cole  surprisingly played by fiona shaw  i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series  the loathsome aunt petunia  so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind  but anyway  any woman has her own youth     is paranoiac and offensive  i do have sympathy for him  love is a two edged sword  happiness and agony are just next to each other  br    br   btw  jim sheridan  s works are all good  in america  the boxer etc   except get rich or die trying    god knows why he chose to direct that crap  really a career taint for him  what a pity           i  m stunned that the reviewers   imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did  it  s an innocuous  sweet  uncomplicated clich     of a film that had two big names from the past in it  both of whom did a decent job   but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels  i like a good romance as well as anyone  but as my wife and i were watching this  and before we saw the rating we said    there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there  s nothing in it to challenge their brains  their faith  their comfort level or their cultural preferences  it  s possible to make a good film like that  and away from her is an example   but this was amateur hour  there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one  truly  another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films  watch the family stone  it  s miles ahead of this schlock           do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you  ve seen  one of   films scott made at rko during his prime        the others are always easy to get  liberal  kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder keg about to explode between the trail riders who drive the longhorns into trail street  the town  s main street  and the sod busters who feed our bellies  it  ll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order  more i won  t say  except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three  randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor  courage  level headedness and willingness to do the right thing  fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they  d learn positive values  robert ryan co stars in this film  playing a good guy for a change  in real life  ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america  s movies  how sad what we get these days  george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers  while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in      in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them  hollywood      derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left  i wonder how all this plays out in liberal  kansas  liberal  after all  was not a dirty word     years ago when the city was named           i went to see this one with much expectation  quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest  even a child can see the missing logic to character  s behaviors  today  s kids need creative stories which would inspire them  which would make them   daydream   about the events  that  s precisely what happened with movies like e t  and star wars a decade ago   how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers   seriously don  t waste your time   money on this one            sigh  leave it to us finns to take a stupid idea  blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool  lordi is a mediocre band at best  and a single gimmick

won the eurovision  that  s it  i rest my case          after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi  yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show  on the good episodes  as darkplace  i cant argue that   of the episodes really are nt that good but the other   certainly make up for it  if i had to pick   great episodes id go for formula  driver steve pising  pronounced pissing  and the great garth marengi  to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie  his argument with def lepord over their name  all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes         i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co  i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital  i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals   br    br   the idiots that put it down on production value don t get the point and probably have never been hospitalized  and never worked in one for sure  billy jack  same era  was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message  br    br   i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned          i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it  in the       s  there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise  it  s one of the best comedies of the       s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary  s excellent comedic performance  which still stands as one of his greatest  this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director  reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time  while this film is hilarious and meatballs   is so bad that it  s fun  meatballs   and meatballs   are absolutely dreadful  recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters           the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u s    we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film  befittingly  the obvious of student v s  teacher is present  but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships  male v s  female  white v s  black  and the individual v s  society  but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v s  himself   br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus  most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other  this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides  it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end   the film also discusses sex and rape  it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time  lawrence fishburne does an over the top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps  he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down trodden with the industrious and positive  other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly  michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance  tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper  in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university  it is a life learning process  not a textual one  i think you  ll find   higher learning   is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general                is rich  ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean  or is she just overreacting  or more precisely  overacting  as usual  actually  both are applicable in director joseph losey  s wandering  meandering mess called   boom    appropriately titled since tempers in the lush  luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode  richard burton climbs taylor  s mountain uninvited  she dresses him in a samurai  s robe complete with saber  though great looking in widescreen  the picture is otherwise quite deadly  a failure even liz   n dick philes should shun  the stars   collective   what the hell    attitude to their late     s film careers reached an ego mad nadir here   pointless  confused  and maddening    boom   is a catastrophe  although screenwriter tennessee williams  who adapted his own unsuccessful play   the milk train doesn  t stop here anymore    was said to be quite fond of it    from               i can  t even describe it  it  s the worst movie i  ve ever seen  i  m being a nice guy when i call it movie  just another big budget made to someone who doesn  t like to think much it  s not even scary  it  s revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this     thing   to trick movie fans  i guess big producers make whatever they want  br    br   just get a big producer  hot chicks  allthough horrible actresses  and a ton of horror movie clich  s and cook it for a week or so  and you  ll get   the nun    br    br   and i thought bad boys   was horrible              the screenplay is the worst part of this film  as it lurches from one premise to the next  missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible   this film is confusing  because the audience doesn  t know what the story is   i had no problem with the low production values and the acting wasn  t great  but this is telly  so it was fine  i don  t mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take  but having such a non sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary  did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash  avoid this at all costs  br    br   the prologue in particular was so poorly written  it needed a voice over to fill in all the details that had been left out  the prologue was rushed  it wasn  t clear what was happening  ie  the russian revolution was reduced to   some riots are happening in petersburg    with the next scene being soldiers arresting them  i know the basic history of the revolution  so i could fill in the details    those pesky communists    the prologue is best ignored  br    br   this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is  it sets up this premise in the asylum  it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film  no  gone  the film assumes she is who she says she is  even though there is still no empirical evidence   it sets up a melodramatic romance  a love so strong  it  ll believe anything she says  okay  a soppy romance  no  because it makes no sense  the love interest seems like a crazed  and incidentally  sleazy  lunatic  bursting out in wild gestures  this also doesn  t work  because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end  they never got married and she returned to america  the love story collapses  despite there being plenty of love scenes  i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love  i find rom com romances more convincing  despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they  ve even spent any time with each other  br    br   it could have been a thriller type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is  and she struggles to prove her identity  no  the court case is summed up rather than dealt with  the bizarre voice over comes back  again to fill in the details of a better film  br    br   the funniest thing to consider is what really happened  anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together  throughout her life  she had bouts of lunatic behaviour  none of this in the film either  there  s a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a   one flew over the cuckoo  s next   twelve monkeys   type informant  thankfully  she vanishes  having brought nothing to the story           lady and the tramp ii  scamp  s adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better  lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original  but this time it  s junior  s turn  lady and tramp  s youngster  scamp  always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him  following the rules in the house  taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy  scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose  scamp meets another dog called angel  they both get along fine and do the things scamp  s mother and father did  having an italian meal  spagetthi and meatballs etc  afterwards  scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal  which is the baby  scamp comes back and angel is joined in the family  i give this movie    out of              wow  what  s this on the video rental store  s shelf in front of me  nothing other than a questionable   sequel   to  mm  it wasn  t a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie  br    br   basically  from the plot outline verbatim  an american diplomat  david huxley  and his fianc  e  tish harrington  venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest  hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute  risa  the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city  the mystery is solved when  in the end  tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and  essentially later on in the story  her fianc  e which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end  br    br   i didn  t like how this had nothing to do with the original  mm at all  the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was  the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film  and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene  otherwise  its a totally different movie  it made for a lousy love story  even before the end is known  which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn  t believe the words coming out of david  s mouth the whole time  but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble  br    br   there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the   shocking   moments of the film  which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this   hellish   sex debauchery  i counted at least    ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown  even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative  br    br   david was no heroic person throughout the film  you could guess he was the main problem long before the end  the actors who played each role were all new to me  which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting   respect    there were plot holes  how did david and richard finally impress tish  s father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute   there were cheesy technology moments  like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen   and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character  the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs  too  because it wasn  t even about a last breath  nobody really dies  but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere   but that was a good    seconds long out of an hour and     long movie  br    br   go rent  and maybe buy  the original  it  s one of joel schumacher  s better and more original films  it has everything better about it from this film  i wouldn  t recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges           ok  honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great  its really not  there were two good things that came out of this movie    jack  s performance  he was very good i can tip my hat for him     danny  s performance  he was good  no other then that it got pretty stupid  and  what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy  she was so bad  she looked the same every time she got scared  the problem with this movie was the ending  i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently  and  the over all movie was just stupid  the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better  so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off                 this episode had potential  the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment  but a phone that constantly rings  is somewhat interesting  and when she explores the noise  there is genuine tension and fear  but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had  br    br   first of all  the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction  e g    it  s funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind      this door has serious damage to it that wasn  t here a minute ago      the door opened by itself  without me touching it    etc    given these supernatural phenomena  plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room  wouldn  t she take some precaution before entering it  maybe she could investigate in the day time  or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else  or maybe she could turn on the lights    also  while in the haunted apartment  she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone  and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide  just unplug the phone  the phone company doesn  t need to be involved  walk up to the phone and unplug it  case closed  br    br   finally  showing the phone scamper across the floor like it  s alive was just comical  if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card  he could  ve done it in a way that didn  t look cartoony  brave little toaster anyone

first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists  think dragnet meets starsky   hutch the show   boiled in a flask full of well known police television show plots and scenarios  this is distilled    times to produce the most pure policeman every made  forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz  for now  save it for later   frank drebin is clueless at most times  a terrible driver  a terrible shot  macho yet sensitive and vulnerable  he is a master of the police investigative methodology  a k a   ask johnny the leathery old shoe shine boy   this does not make

course of   golden episodes  br    br   the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote ables  most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly  the magic never came from the sight gags however  at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the foreground  with crazy things occurring in the background  the movies can best be described as    minute compilations of the best gags from this series  think of monty python  s and now for something completely different      br    br   if you liked airplane        naked gun        or top secret  then you will definitely enjoy this   br    br   i always liked the series better than the movies  even though i saw the movies first  why    words   no o j           a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus  she refuses him  but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway  and there it starts   a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero  it can  t be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic  br    br   in short  a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film  and imo  it succeeds at being a nice film  it  s no masterpiece  but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion   the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is  even with the superhero thing going  believable  br    br   so  thin story  but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time  br    br     out of    broken hearts         i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don t say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment  this film is amazing love me xxx p s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops this film will go down in children s film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children          the film someone had to make  br    br   waco  the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco  texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government cover up  br    br   the first thing you need to know about this film  you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies  this is not done for shock value  but to illustrate points about the way they died  as if you were present at the coroner  s inquest  br    br   the second thing you should know about this film  at two and a quarter hours  it  s pretty ponderous   especially if you already followed the events closely at the time  if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media  or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report  this may be essential viewing  if  on the other hand you want a more concise  albeit unapologetically one sided  version of events  you should see   waco  the big lie    br    br   in summary  this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event  and is very sobering  but as a work of film making  could test your patience  especially if you have a short attention span  and it  s at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the    minutes reports  br    br   perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story  such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect  and their charismatic leaders  all rock musicians themselves  picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them           what a good movie  at last a

rock around the clock  br    br   anyway  still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n  roll i have ever seen  far much better than spinal tap for instance  why  because in still crazy  people are mature  they have a different point of view about rock  about love and about life  they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much  beyond the story itself  we see characters with their own personality  weaknesses and dreams  like anyone of us  br    br   spend a good time watching this  listen to the awesome soundtrack   and finally thinking of your own future  br    br   bye

lift  in the kitchen scene  i liked it where owen called larry    cousin patty    and momma said    you don  t have a cousin patty    and owen shouts   you lied to me    and el cabongs larry with the frying pan  then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift  that is thwarted  and she kicks larry off the train  well  everything back to normal  the ex wife lives  but momma kicked the bucket on her own  maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways  a fun movie it is  and the cast is great  a classic    stars           yes  it is a bit cheesy  but it  s suspenseful and entertaining  and one of my favorites  there are some excellent actors in the film  and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters  it  s interesting to see david soul in a   bad guy   role  i thought he was quite believable  and rather chilling  as the ever more paranoid co  robert conrad is a long time favorite  i think he brings his character to life very well  and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his i  ve watched  movies or tv   br    br   i watch this movie every so often but our tape  a vhs tv copy i got  is such poor quality it  s difficult to fully enjoy it  this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd  maybe it wouldn  t be universally sought after  but i  m sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version  i  ll keep hoping           so it isn  t an epic  but for people experiencing anything similar br    br    sibling suicide  it might be an interesting way of therapy  an br    br   imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well br    br   spent  for some reason  it hasn  t really caught on in the audience  br    br   something i do believe is a result of the main theme  why did she br    br   commit suicide  clearly  this is hardly something that us br    br   moviegoers will flock to  had it been an european production it br    br   probably would have reached its audience in a much greater br    br   extent  it is however  a movie that although the realism tainted by a br    br   shimmering romanticized glow  gives the viewer a whole hearted br    br   impression           i absolutely loved this film  i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful  i remember how hard it was when john was shot  however  watching the   two of us   took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility  i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what   might have been    aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on  i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms  jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john  my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene   which was so poignant  the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction  both of which i feel are appropriate  given the circumstances           previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film  s plot details than i could  what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful  in every sense   emotionally  visually  editorially   just gorgeous  br    br   if you like movies that are wonderful to look at  and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant  i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art  br    br   on a scale of   to     i  d give it about an       the only reason i shy away from   is that it is a mood piece  if you are in the mood for a really artistic  very romantic film  then it  s a     i definitely think it  s a must see  but none of us can be in that mood all the time  so  overall                 great premise  poor execution  cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written  poorly directed  poorly edited  waste of film  only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food  br    br   joan chen  mercedes ruehl  kyra sedgwick  and alfre woodard should fire their agents           have to agree that this movie and it  s talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve  here  s hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience  the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent  perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary  good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot  may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors           i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday  first of all  i wanted to see gina lollobrigida   and here i wasn  t disappointed  she looked gorgeous  second of all  through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca  s films  on this account  however  i was sadly disappointed  i found the jokes predictable  apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war  and the characters completely one dimensional  also  the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion  with no sense of drama at all  i kept watching until the end  but i got bored very quickly and just sat there  waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida           this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making  the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all  we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face  the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were   of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room  the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways  ruined the night   ok so pros and cons  pros beautiful setting in hawaii  looks good on bluray  cons worst acting ever  you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday  predictable poor plot  zero character development  forced jokes which fall flat  many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma  may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap           this was my first gaspar noe movie i  ve watched and i have to say i was shocked  i don  t mind gore in generally  but this isn  t even gore   it  s real butchering  for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting  leaving aside these aspects  the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant  when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given  you can  t stop and take a minute to think about it  the actors did their job well  representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society  the movie is full of metaphors  but i  ll let you figure them out  don  t watch it if you want to have a lite  relaxing time  i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema           i agree with bigalc   this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in       tom selleck does a fantastic job here  as always  and the movie is greatly humorous and educational  i  m a big fan of tom selleck  s  and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part  bringing the film to life in a way i can  t imagine any other actor being able to pull off   br    br   this film featured some first rate japanese actors  and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck   i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie   japan  s an awesome place to go  whether you want to party  sight see or just try to take everything in           i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt  ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role  gandolfini gives his typical a performance  the entire cast is funny  the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome  i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted  i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy  can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives  the best part to this film  to me anyway  were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped  namely  the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree  go see it and have a good laugh           although i lived in australia in       i moved overseas not long after  fed up with constant industrial unrest  the general worship of mediocrity   unless one is a sportsman    and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north   br    br   consequently i missed the dismissal  along with many other australian made tv dramas of the     s and     s  such as the superb janus and phoenix series  which i have since seen  along with wildside  br    br   to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and  as far as i am aware  accurate  however  as to public   outrage   it only shows one side of the picture  not how families were riven by the controversy  i know  as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward   br    br   but the commentary is  in my view  very one sided throughout  the inescapable fact is that  notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community  the australian electorate chose   and chose decisively   in favour of fraser  as they did again two years later   br    br   this apart  a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama           i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america  but this man does it for me  that mustache gets me riled up  i remember when i first saw a video of his  that girl he beat was amazing  the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity  it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt  rushmore  if i could ask him one question  it would be   if you were a hot dog  would you eat yourself    will orhan be doing a reunion tour  take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot  true music from the heart never fades away  vive la john denver  gracias my friend  o f f l   orhan fan for life           i never want to see this movie again  br    br   not only is it dreadfully bad  but i can  t stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick  br    br   mostly i can  t stand watching this terrible movie  br    br   frankly  there is no reason to watch this awful film  the plot is just plain stupid  the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films   br    br   i warn you don  t watch it  the images will haunt you for a long while to come           the problem is the role of the characters in the film  man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself  the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film   two people who are kidnapped  treated like animals  and yet given such a shallow  stereotypical role within the film    the kidnapper  british anthropologist  ends up being the hero of the film because he   manages   to relate to the pygmies    no notion of how the two hostages feel  of their point of view  of their ordeal    i find it is a shallow film  with a one sided fundamentally racist view    it never manages to move away from the   white mans   view          life begins   and ends   in a typical       s maternity   recovery ward  where we view    hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women  played by loretta young  glenda farrell  clara blandick  aunty em      vivienne osborne  dorothy tree  and gloria shea  as they await to give birth  while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted  it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in      was like for our grandmothers and great grandmothers  i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving  br    br   oddly enough  the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member  young eric linden as jed sutton  grace  s  loretta young  husband  what an actor  as a first time father  jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table  i felt his every concern keenly  i  d like to see more of this actor  s work  he had a very emotional voice  which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind  in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia  who screamed   don  t cut  don  t cut    as scarlett fled the hospital in horror  chilling  another great performance is from aline macmahon  who plays miss bowers  the nurse  her character is a salt of the earth type  the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays  who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession  br    br   loretta young did another superb acting job here as well  a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace  my  she is great in these precodes  i  ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months  br    br   glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste  didn  t anyone know back in      that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies   health   but her character redeems herself in the end  br    br   also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland  silent movie star  as a grieving italian husband  his screen time was brief  but notable  br    br   life begins is a must see precode  try to catch it sometime on tcm  but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into    out of              this is a great film  touching and strong  the direction is without question breathless  good work to the team  i feel so sorry for marlene  by the grace of god go you or i          i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper  no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie  for example  the names of some serbian terrorists  that i remember  are caradan maldic  ivanic loyvek and leo hasse  what kind of names are that  certainly not serbian  by the way  caradan maldic    what a name  i laughed for days thinking about it  probably an implication on karadzic and mladic  secondly  there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians  a journalist like the main character ought to have known that  thirdly  the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo croatian  all this aside  this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper thin and full of holes  at times it makes no sense whatsoever              criticism does mention spoilers  br    br   i rarely make user comments  but this is one movie i have no problem slandering  this movie stinks  and its mediocre of rating of   and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp  the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were  despite what its ad claims  this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller  the pace of this movie was extremely slow  i actually left for about    minutes half way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression  i refer to you the part where angelina jolie  s character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse   hands   the movie is not at all scary  but tries to compensate this with a love subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie  s character and denzel washington  s  of course  what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor student relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling  however  even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two  with such a crappy movie  i was half expecting a plot twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit  things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off  anybody with a  th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved   a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock  s rear window   the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough  but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen  esoterically speaking  i even think the murderer  s intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial   chess game   and gets with his pet project  angelina  br    br   if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts  like i am   you will not appreciate this film  if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne  the late night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer  the ridiculous serial killer to prime investigator relationship  the horrible   woman trying to get by in an all male dominated workforce aka sotl    see this movie    but even then its too slow paced and you  d be bored           possible spoilers  perhaps  i must say that   cinderella ii  dreams come true   is one of the worst movies ever made  first of all  the movie was made during the height of disney  s sequel rampage  it was created around the same time as   the little mermaid ii      the jungle book ii    and   peter pan ii    all of which were disservices to their original film classics   disney also made   the hunchback of notre dame ii   and   atlantis ii    but i  m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place     let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films  and i absolutely adore the original disney   cinderella    the sequel to   cinderella    however  was a waste of time  the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching  in the original  cinderella was kind and loving  the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era phrasing like    i  m going to do this banquet my way    let me also tell you that new cinderella  as i have affectionately named her  says    ewww    that is the anti cinderella  i try to find the best in people  but in the sequel  anastasia  one of the stepsisters  is good  what the heck  why  they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia  my question to the world  did the people at disney watch the original   cinderella   when making this sequel  well  it surely doesn  t seem so  if i remember correctly  anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine  i am all for redemption and forgiveness  but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie  in the first one  anastasia was evil  in the second one  she is good  one just can  t leave a story like this  i hope disney realizes that this movie  among other movies  is shaming walt disney  s name  perhaps now that michael eisner is gone  things will start shaping up around the house of mouse           hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of      s  this movie  s true score  br    br   as mentioned before chris rock is the king  previous to going to see this movie i wasn  t that over the top about him but now i  m banging on the doors of chris rock  s website begging him to take me on as his protege  this film is truly funny  if you don  t find this movie funny you really need therapy and it  s humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably   class division  love  wealth  employment  dreams  stand up comedy    the list goes on  br    br   there was one slight disappointment for me however  this was that in going into this film i didn  t realise that it was actually a remake of   heaven can wait   another quite good movie made in      with warren beatty  as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago   regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any   you get the picture  br    br   well to the actual plot of the film  br    br   don  t spoil the experience for yourself  don  t read the plot  just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it  go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time  go and see it because it  s a cinema experience that doesn  t leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets  go see it because it is a good movie           formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer  vargas   it looks very much like a tv movie  not really exciting  the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it  no real surprises here  though it is nice to see vargas  great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell  s part is very small and doesn  t add much to the movie  michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts  the chase scenes are standard fare           whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome  otherwise  this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor  her downward phase   and richard burton  his miscasting phase   tennessee williams wrote   the milk train doesn  t stop here anymore   and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play  but apparently  he was the only one  taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money  br    br   whatever  it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner  exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears  br    br   it  s so campy that among taylor fans it  s probably considered a   must see   kind of thing  but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand  you  re way ahead of me  sadly  this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress  even after winning two oscars  for burton  it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb  judge for yourself if you dare           viva la bam this   jackass   spin off focuses on the  obviously scripted  adventures of bam margera and his pals  johnny knoxville  brandon dicamillo  etc   this show  while it has its fair share of gross out comedy and crazy stunts  focuses mainly on bam  s torturing of his parents  br    br   i  m sorry to say this  bam  but    you  re in no way as cool as you think you are  this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny  and yes  i liked jackass   but also narcissistic beyond belief  the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he  s going to do   whatever the f      he wants to  how about you do something that is actually funny  i liked   jackass   for what it was worth  the camera work was horrible   any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents   garage   but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy  dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed  br    br   not so with   viva la bam    we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives  but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy  the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining  but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile  br    br     viva la bam   is a poor spin off of that does little good but feed margera  s already too big ego  i don  t recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone           i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing  he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor  like many others on here  i don  t know how to categorize this film  it wasn  t scary or spooky so can  t be called a horror  the plot was so wafer thin it can  t be a drama  there was no suspense so it can  t be a thriller  its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project  people who liked this film used words  like   ambiguity   and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn  t there  like the blair witch  people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying  this movie actually started off well with the family   meeting   the locals after hitting a deer  it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next    minutes   well over half the film   nothing happened  the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining  it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie  finally  when something does happen  its not even clear how the father was shot  how he dies   the nurse said his liver was only grazed   and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with  rd grade special effects  the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way  the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied  i would have bailed out with    minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself  it didn  t           schlocky     s horror films   ya gotta love   em  in contrast to today  s boring slasher flicks  these k tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula  br    br   this is a b movie about the making of a b movie   that went horribly wrong  faith domergue  this island earth  stars as an over the hill  b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home  her boyfriend director  who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude  is filming on location and on a tight schedule  the ken doll co star discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add   realism    unfortunately    realism   is something they could have done without  br    br   john carradine  having long since given up looking for the   th gland  the unearthly   now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate  he goes about his daily work  but always seems to run afoul of the director  br    br   the horror builds slowly  a dead cat here  john carradine entering a grave there  finally culminating in seven  yes seven murders   at least there  s truth in advertising   it  s just sad that the ghoul didn  t understand that there was a movie being made above him  how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work  face it  you just can  t go around tugging on satan  s coat and expect him to take it lying down  br    br   sterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses           i suppose for      this film was supposed to be    cool      but looking back now      years   it  s charm was just as silly as it  s entertainment value   granted   the special effects do well on t v  with the series that started in        but for the big screen    i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting   i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview  obviously not well staged   or trained   overall   it  s pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it   for fun laughs sake  this was probably one of irwin allen  s biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it   barabara eden went on to play    genie    on t v  micheal ansara was her husband   now that is a cool part about this film   i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie   neat            this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong  s   new wave   that began with tsui hark  s   zu  warriors of magic mountain    tsui set a tone for the new wave  s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  jackie chan  sammo hung  wong jing  ching siu tung  etc   accepted from then on as a given  namely  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony  if not outright comedy    burning paradise   put a stop to all that  and with a vengeance  br    br   it  s not that there isn  t humor here  but it is a purely human humor  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw  but this is just as humans are  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time  br    br   when irony is at last introduced into the film  it is the nastiest possible  emanating from the   abbot   of red lotus temple  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before  he is the very incarnation of milton  s satan from   paradise lost      better to rule in hell than serve in heaven    and if he can  t get to satan  s hell soon enough  he  ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule  br    br   that  s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here  it  s not that the abbot just wants to kill people  he wants them to despair  to feel utterly hopeless  to accept his nihilism as all encompassing reality  thus there  s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself   it has become all there is to the universe  and the abbot  claiming mastery of infinite power  is in charge  br    br   of course  fortunately  the film doesn  t end there  though there are losses  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails   if you want to know how  see the film   yet there is no doubt that  in viewing this film  we visit hell  hopefully  we do not witness our own afterlives  but we certainly feel chastened by the experience   and somehow better for it over all           now i don  t hate cheap movies  i just don  t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad  s camcorder  if i rent a movie  i want it to be a movie  not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv   tapes  br    br   maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great  and it wasn  t  maybe i hate it because it  s cheap  has the dumbest plot ever  the most unrealistic characters ever and the really  really  really worst showdown in the history of films ever  even tom savini can  t save this  br    br   seriously  this one is a complete waste of time           a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do  that being stealing from farms and killing prey  until a trio of farmers decide they  ve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem   solved    they are of course   out foxed   at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land  br    br   the  film   version  and i use the term film very loosely  is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies  they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely  so kudos to them  they  ll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book           as soon as it hits a screen  it destroys all intelligent life forms around   but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn  t fall into any known movie category  it deserves a brand new denomination of its own   it  s a   neurological drama     it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person  s brain  br    br   it  s the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one  it drives you speechless  all you members go numb  your mouth falls open and remains so  and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf  br    br   no small feat for such a sort of a   movie    br    br   the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage                 for a film made in senegal  based  i guess loosely on carmen  the book  by prosper merimee  this film doesn  t achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films  br    br   ms  gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at  her fiery dancing smolders the screen  as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film  br    br   this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders  but a real carmen  she is not  br    br   we would like to see ms  gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here           this is a very noir kind of episode  it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend  the recently divorced karen mills  pat delaney  daughter in law of john huston  who knew a few things about noir film  and her daughter  when they arrive  karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room  he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace  of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive  they see no sign of karen  but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes  so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect  br    br   this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again  rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn  t think was important at the time  but now might lead to a clue as to what happened  it  s a really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent  it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn  t just some clueless old man either  as he says   you come to me because i  m your father  and i  m smarter than you    this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smarts  br    br   this episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker  who played angelique in the   dark shadows   series and went on to play laura banner  bruce  s wife in the   incredible hulk   series a few years later  she looks terrific here  br    br   this episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family  a name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed a mob family  this time  its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehend  br    br   lt  diehl  tom atkins  makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police sargent  i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police  frankly  they were right  though i prefer the later lt  chapman to lt  diehl   br    br   not a lot of the typical   rockford   humor in this episode  but a good mystery with a lot of heart           the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events  and i  ve been a wrestling fan for a good few years now  the other shows may have better matches  but i  ve always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement  br    br   i  m not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don  t see it as fair to ruin the results on a review  i will comment on the quality of them though  br    br   we have the standard   matches  and then the big rumble event  two from smackdown and two from raw  br    br   shawn michaels and edge open up for raw  this proves to be a good match from two talented guys  this is a match i  d recommend watching  it  s hard to sum up without giving away the winner  br    br   next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster  be whoever it is  giant gonzales  yokozuna  kamala    well this time it  s heidenreich  its also a casket match  typical undertaker fare  watch if you  re a fan  i have to admit i am  purely for the entertainment factor  it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match  br    br   the next two matches are the title matches  for once smackdown manages to upstage raw  their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable  but with a anti climax and let down to end it  raw  s match is a pretty dull and boring affair  which is a pity as i  m a fan of both guys involved  br    br   now to the main reason i love the event  the rumble  it  s a pretty good one this year  coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win  and it may not prove a big surprise  but hey  its very enjoyable  there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated  there is the token guy who doesn  t make it to the ring  the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished  and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant  it has its usual highs and lows  and i loved the ending  in particular the vince mcmahon entrance  br    br   i  d recommend this show  not the wwe on top form  but its still good  add it to your collection           i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones  we  d stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other  br    br   we called one of our mates   zipmole watkins   after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of   restyling   on his nose by the back street abortionist  br    br   lots of great lines   remember at      in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man  take it easy guy      gandhi as a local shopkeeper  br    br   tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph  daniel peacock  to be a barman   it  s no good amanda i  ll never make it as a bar man   helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match   see the match last night  i thought woodcock played well   after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar    see the match last night      yeah  i thought i played well   br    br   we still do odd stupid lines now     reg and ralph      or        ralph and reg  reg  reg    reg reg reg reg   br    br   lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets   the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line     and he  ll mark your packages   return to sender   br    br   good old danny peacock   you added a lot to some young drinkers   evenings sir  br    br     update   i found a couple of episodes on tape   i  m going to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube             destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized  this game deserves all the recognition it deserves  at a time when first person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers  graphic adventures are a dying breed  with great pun and humour  the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy  life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island   prediction  the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too  i guarantee it           stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century  two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look after their ageing father  one day  a french woman  babette  comes to work for them  after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in  her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast  which changes the lives of all those invited  this is a film about human and cultural interaction  reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french  and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south  it is also about human needs  and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses  a profoundly uplifting film           this movie was way over hyped  a lot of the viewers  who thought this was   amazing   must have been into the old school movies  cause the whole movie is set in the past  at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past  so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass  but it just going  basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past  and the   don  t mix very well in this movie  even with special effects  you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with  there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did  so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying   it  s the greatest movie ever done    it  s just crap on a stick  it also didn  t help that the story line was sooo crappy  i don  t understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced  and i also don  t understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this  it  s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print     it will all be done on a computer    this was a movie that should have been on a movie network  because nothing about this movie was revolutionary  i  m very upset with myself for paying money to see this  whatever you do  don  t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow           it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in       this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise  didn  t they do that with truman capote the same year  and the zodiac killer last year  interesting  br    br   writer director david michael latt didn  t have steven spielberg  s budget and c  thomas howell is not tom cruise  this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed      million worldwide  br    br   the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles  who played a pastor that was giving up on his god  br    br   gary busey was creepy as an army lt           i dunno sometimes   you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there  but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved    bat people    which i saw under the title   it lives by night    is just such a movie  you can  t watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on   night gallery    and not one of the better ones  either   br    br   the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were bat who drinks human blood   actually  you  d think if he was turning into a real bat  he  d be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket  but because this is a cheap  lurid horror movie  blood  s the word   in spite of the fact that he has grand mal seizures at the drop of a hat  and black out episodes almost every night  his friend and fellow physician  dr  mustache aspen extreme  insists that he  s just having an   allergic reaction   to the rabies shots  meanwhile  the world  s most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls  and one wino   also meanwhile  the doctor  s wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction   br    br   it  s not so much that the acting is bad   you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices  and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script  even the guy who plays the sheriff   okay  it is pretty bad  but it  s bad in a clich  d  wooden  professional way   it  s just that everything about the acting  the way the scenes are paced  the costumes  the dialog  the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to  well  slap everyone involved  br    br   i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky  unsettling little cult favorite  but  br    br     the director needed to beat michael pataki  an experienced character actor  with a chair until pataki agreed to act  and not just channel dennis weaver   br    br     he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole   bat bites human  who then turns into a bat   scenario   br    br      he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his   episodes    instead of resorting to   man has a seizure   page from the little golden book of clich  d acting mannerisms   br    br      he needed to rework the whole   wife   character  make her both more intelligent  less shrill and waaaaay more observant   br    br   i would never voluntarily watch this film again  except with the help of mike and the bots  it  s bad  but it isn  t bad in a silly  humorous or interesting way  still better than   battlefield earth   or   waterworld    though           big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing  great production  and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap  the two stars work great together  and  what can i say  amanda bynes shines  putting   irkel   and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches  watch this film with your kids  if you don  t laugh throughout it  you must not have been paying attention           tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers  and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie  well  all i can say is i totally regretted it  these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant  unimaginative and kitch to the extreme  not that this is bad on its own sketches that are supposed to make people laugh  but fail to do so  the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend  and they decided to support his movie by starring in it i can  t think of anything else because this movie is so cheap  fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven  t disappointed me ever since  i would recommend you to avoid this film  unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled           on watching this film  i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity  karen carpenter was a carefree  but very unconfident young lady  whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs  as with all celebrities of today  they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks  styles  etc  this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight  which eventually caused her death  this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching  but on starting to view it  then i was hooked  in the same way that the tina turner story does  then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life  the acting was superb and even after nearly    years after it was made  then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining  br    br   i would recommend this to anyone who hasn  t yet watched it  it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged           nothing is sacred  just ask ernie fosselius  these days  everybody has a video camera  and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying  quickly written and shot  and often posted directly to the internet  spoofs are hot these days  and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don  t get off on their own self importance     years ago  when the first star wars was made  it was a different world  filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare  then god gave us hardware wars  it was shot to look cheap  or was it just cheap   and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact  does that take away from the experience  heck no  that  s what makes it so great  it was raw and unpolished  and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie  from fluke starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber  i did that when i was young   to chewchilla the wookie monster  to auggie ben doggie  s   nah  just a little headache   remark  this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films  rent it  buy it  borrow it from a friend  and may the farce be with you  always           i hated it  i hate self aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art  this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid  after the first half hour  i fastfowarded through the dvd version  and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over  i became angered that i had spent hard earned money for sophomoric clap trap  tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie  let alone art           i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies  but my god    this was the worst movie i have ever seen  bad acting  bad effects  bad script  bad everything   br    br   the plot follows a group of teen cliche  s on their way to a rave  that takes place in broad daylight  at a remote island  however  when the group arrives  all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes  determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers  the clan set  s off on a mission through a zombie infested forest  during this crusade  they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids  they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors  basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the   house of the dead    this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence  redundant clips from the hotd video game  and sloppy matrix esque camera rotations  one of the character  s even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others  why  not because he was noble and brave  but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled  i  m supposed to feel sorry for this guy    br    br   to sum it all up  there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is  the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen  and i  m sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh t could easily cover the costs it took to make it  grade  f          if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school  try to convince your teacher to see something else  believe me  anything is better than this movie  it is slow paced  confusing  boring  poorly constructed  gory  gringy  do i need to go on  it  s message is good  but i have seen them been handled better in several other films  the acting isn  t even any good  this movie is just even more awkward  as it start off as being funny  not intensional though because of it  s surreal story  than at the end  just becomes uncomfortable to watch  br    br   i honestly feel like   hour and    minutes of my life has been robbed  why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for    minutes  than watch them drive through a traffic jam for    minutes  listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear  witness a sort of rape  than see the female lead role eat her husband  br    br   honestly this movie deserves nothing but a       and if your not happy with my preview seriously i  m an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism  but this movie was just awful  make any excuse you can  to avoid this film           this is like a zoology textbook  given that its depiction of animals is so accurate  however  here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film  br    br     handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons  it doesn  t matter how many times you shoot at the komodo  bullets just won  t go near it  br    br     the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra  or a giant komodo dragon  is just to stand there  the exception to this rule is if you  ve been told to stay very still  in which case you should run off  until the komodo is right next to you  and then you should stand there  expecting defeat  br    br     minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching  br    br            is a memory enhancement tool  and an ample substitute for losing your boating license getting arrested  br    br     members of elite army units don  t see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over sized beings  maybe the computer generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it  br    br     when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing  a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need  sound gear  a second camera  microphones etc are all superfluous  br    br     when you hear a loud animal scream  and one person has a gun  he should take it out and point it at the nearest person  br    br     when you take a gun out  the sound of the safety being taken off will be made  even if your finger is nowhere near the safety br    br     reporters agree to go half way around the world in order to expose something   without having the faintest idea what they  re exposing  background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism  br    br     handguns hold at least    bullets in one clip  and then more than that in the next clip  despite that  those with guns claim that they will need more ammo  br    br     expensive cameras  also  remember that the reporter only has one camera  are regularly left behind without even a moment  s hesitation or regret  these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves  br    br     the blonde girl really is the stupid one  br    br     the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it  thus making it unsafe  takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection   and nobody says a word about it  br    br     high tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets  br    br     genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to     feet long in a matter of a day  but don  t grow at all in the weeks either side  br    br     the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don  t meet contact deadlines  br    br     men with guns don  t necessarily change the direction they  re shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them  instead  they just keep shooting into the air  br    br     the better looking you are  the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures  br    br     women  s intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds  br    br     any time you  re being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age  br    br     animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for   swearing   at the same volume  br    br     old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military           one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just   oz episode you  ll be hooked  they are right  as this is exactly what happened with me  br    br   the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence  which set in right from the word go  trust me  this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid  this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs  sex or violence  its is hardcore  in the classic use of the word  br    br   it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary  it focuses mainly on emerald city  an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards  so privacy is not high on the agenda  em city is home to many  aryans  muslims  gangstas  latinos  christians  italians  irish and more    so scuffles  death stares  dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away  br    br   i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldn  t dare  forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences  forget charm  forget romance   oz doesn  t mess around  the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal  i couldn  t say i was ready for it  but as i watched more  i developed a taste for oz  and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence  not just violence  but injustice  crooked guards who  ll be sold out for a nickel  inmates who  ll kill on order and get away with it  well mannered  middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience  watching oz  you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing    thats if you can get in touch with your darker side           a wonderful little production   br    br   the filming technique is very unassuming  very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting  and sometimes discomforting  sense of realism to the entire piece   br    br   the actors are extremely well chosen  michael sheen not only   has got all the polari   but he has all the voices down pat too  you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams   diary entries  not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece  a masterful production about one of the great master  s of comedy and his life   br    br   the realism really comes home with the little things  the fantasy of the guard which  rather than use the traditional   dream   techniques remains solid then disappears  it plays on our knowledge and our senses  particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets  particularly of their flat with halliwell  s murals decorating every surface  are terribly well done           i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend  sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy  the plot is simplistic  but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable  even the well bread suspected serial killer   while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point    risk addiction  i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love  br    br   this was the most i  d laughed at one of woody  s comedies in years  dare i say a decade    while i  ve never been impressed with scarlet johanson  in this she managed to tone down her   sexy   image and jumped right into a average  but spirited young woman  br    br   this may not be the crown jewel of his career  but it was wittier than   devil wears prada   and more interesting than   superman   a great comedy to go see with friends           basically there  s a family where a little boy  jake  thinks there  s a zombie in his closet   his parents are fighting all the time  br    br   this movie is slower than a soap opera    and suddenly  jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie  br    br   ok  first of all when you  re going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama  as a drama the movie is watchable  parents are divorcing   arguing like in real life  and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film  i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie  and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots  br    br     out of    just for the well playing parents   descent dialogs  as for the shots with jake  just ignore them           petter mattei  s   love in the time of money   is a visually stunning film to watch  mr  mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations  this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money  power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter   br    br   this being a variation on the arthur schnitzler  s play about the same theme  the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect  each one is connected in one way  or another to the next person  but no one seems to know the previous point of contact  stylishly  the film has a sophisticated luxurious look  we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat  br    br   the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits  a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment  as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter  br    br   the acting is good under mr  mattei  s direction  steve buscemi  rosario dawson  carol kane  michael imperioli  adrian grenier  and the rest of the talented cast  make these characters come alive  br    br   we wish mr  mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work           probably my all time favorite movie  a story of selflessness  sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause  but it  s not preachy or boring  it just never gets old  despite my having seen it some    or more times in the last    years  paul lukas   performance brings tears to my eyes  and bette davis  in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles  is a delight  the kids are  as grandma says  more like   dressed up midgets   than children  but that only makes them more fun to watch  and the mother  s slow awakening to what  s happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling  if i had a dozen thumbs  they  d all be   up   for this movie           i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my hero  s every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe i  ve got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my rhymes would be    lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit if this is so then i must go so lets do it           this show was an amazing  fresh   innovative idea in the     s when it first aired  the first   or   years were brilliant  but things dropped off after that  by       the show was not really funny anymore  and it  s continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today  br    br   it  s truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen  the writing is painfully bad  the performances are almost as bad   if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts  this show probably wouldn  t still be on the air  i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed  how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity  i felt i must give   stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success  as it is now  the show is just awful  i can  t believe it  s still on the air           encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film  bad mistake  i  ve seen      films and this is truly one of the worst of them   it  s awful in almost every way  editing  pacing  storyline    acting    soundtrack  the film  s only song   a lame country tune   is played no less than four times   the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme  rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film   br    br   the only thing that prevents me giving this a   score is harvey keitel   while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort  one for keitel obsessives only           if you like original gut wrenching laughter you will like this movie  if you are young or old then you will love this movie  hell even my mom liked it  br    br   great camp              phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines  br    br   at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didn  t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore  br    br   its a low budget film  thats never a problem in itself   there were some pretty interesting characters  but eventually i just lost interest  br    br   i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking  br    br   for something similar but better try   brother from another planet             i saw this movie when i was about    when it came out  i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air  the horror  the horror  br    br   as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons  i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero  a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end  i didn  t care much for the romantic angle as a    year old and the predictable plots  i love them now for the unintentional humor  br    br   but  about a year or so later  i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star  janet leigh  was bumped off early in the film  i sat up and took notice at that point  since screenwriters are making up the story  make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula  there are no rules            so im not a big fan of boll  s work but then again not many are  i enjoyed his movie postal  maybe im the only one   boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished   br    br   people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned  that this is not far cry    this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks   feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with  these players go by the names of til schweiger  udo kier and ralf moeller  br    br   three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz  so the tale goes like this  jack carver played by til schweiger  yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes    however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass   people have complained about how he  s not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we don  t really know what he looked like when he was kicking a      br    br   however  the storyline in this film is beyond demented  we see the evil mad scientist dr  krieger played by udo kier  making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called  performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of   spoiler   vancouver for some reason  thats right no palm trees here  instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods  we haven  t even gone far before i started to cry  mehehe  i cannot go on any more   if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience  meaning most of it will suck  br    br   there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes  until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh   the movie far cry reeks of scheisse  that  s poop for you simpletons  from a fa r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead   btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes he  s on screen            the cast played shakespeare  br    br   shakespeare lost  br    br   i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses  but why ruin something so good  br    br   is it because   the scottish play   is my favorite shakespeare  i do not know  what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler  hence bowdlerization  tried to do something similar in the victorian era  br    br   in other words  you cannot improve perfection  br    br   i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text  and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie  as the saying goes  just does not cut it           this a fantastic movie of three prisoners who become famous  one of the actors is george clooney and i m not a fan but this roll is not bad  another good thing about the movie is the soundtrack  the man of constant sorrow   i recommand this movie to everybody  greetings bart          kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes  only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film i  ve ever seen  sort of like a high school film project  what was rosanna arquette thinking   and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town  pretty hard to get involved with this one  no lessons to be learned from it  no brilliant insights  just stilted and quite ridiculous  but lots of skin  if that intrigues you  videotaped nonsense    what was with the bisexual relationship  out of nowhere  after all the heterosexual encounters  and what was with that absurd dance  with everybody playing their stereotyped roles  give this one a pass  it  s like a million other miles of bad  wasted film  money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa                some films just simply should not be remade  this is one of them  in and of itself it is not a bad film  but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the      film of the same title  liam neeson was excellent as he always is  and most of the cast holds up  with the exception of owen wilson  who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke  but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in it  s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects  again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film  but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more            this movie made it into one of my top    most awful movies  horrible   br    br   there wasn  t a continuous minute where there wasn  t a fight with one monster or another  there was no chance for any character development  they were too busy running from one sword fight to another  i had no emotional attachment  except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them   br    br   scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies  lotr  star wars and matrix   br    br   examples br    br    the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda  obee one and vader   br    br    the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings   elijah wood is the victim in both films  and wait      it hypnotizes  stings  its victim and wraps them up     uh hello     br    br    and the whole machine vs  humans theme was the matrix  or terminator      br    br   there are more examples but why waste the time  and will someone tell me what was with the nazi  s     nazi  s      br    br   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion  the movie could not decide if it was a children  s movie or an adult movie and wasn  t much of either   br    br   just awful  a real disappointment to say the least  save your money            i remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in       my dad took me my brother   sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england  i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies  if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is    miles away  would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it            an awful film  it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe  they  ve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition  my complaint is not that they  ve taken liberties with the facts  if the story were good  that would perfectly fine  but it  s simply bizarre    by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film  so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script  i suppose there weren  t enough naked people in the factual version  it  s hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artist  s life    we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if they  d favored the rest of the film with same brevity            after the success of die hard and it  s sequels it  s no surprise really that in the     s  a glut of   die hard on a         movies cashed in on the wrong guy  wrong place  wrong time concept  that is what they did with cliffhanger  die hard on a mountain just in time to rescue sly   stop or my mom will shoot   stallone  s career  br    br   cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream  especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing  base jumping  aviation  facial expressions  acting skills  all in all it  s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk  stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse  however  if you an forget all the nonsense  it  s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills  and unintentionally  plenty of laughs  br    br   you  ve got to love john lithgows sneery evilness  his tick every box band of baddies  and best of all  the permanently harassed and hapless   turncoat   agent  rex linn as travers  br    br   he may of been henry in   portrait of a serial killer   but michael rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as hal  he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors   that man never hurt anybody   and whilst he surely can  t be  it really does look like ralph waite  s frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death  br    br   mention too must go to former   london  s burning   actor craig fairbrass as the brit bad guy  who comes a cropper whilst using hal as a human football  yes  you can  t help enjoy that bit  hal needed a good kicking  br    br   so forget your better judgement  who cares if   that could never happen    lower your acting expectations  turn up the volume and enjoy  and if you  re looking for qaulen  he  s the one wearing the helicopter            i had the terrible misfortune of having to view this   b movie   in it  s entirety  br    br   all i have to say is    save your time and money    this has got to be the worst b movie of all time  it shouldn  t even be called a b movie  more like an f movie  because it fails in all aspects that make a good movie  the story is not interesting at all  all of the actors are paper thin and not at all believable  it has bad direction and the action sequences are so fake it  s almost funny       almost  br    br   the movie is just packed full of crappy one liners that no respectable person could find amusing in the least little bit  br    br   this movie is supposed to be geared towards men  but all the women in it are so utterly unattractive  especially that old wrinkled thing that comes in towards the end  they try to appear sexy in those weird  horrible costumes and they fail miserably    br    br   even some of the most ridiculous b movies will still give you some laughs  but this is just too painful to watch             what an absolutely stunning movie  if you have     hrs to kill  watch it  you won  t regret it  it  s too much fun  rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn  t anything more other than him  i still liked it  the music by a r rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times  you really start liking it            first of all  let  s get a few things straight here  a  i am an anime fan  always has been as a matter of fact  i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool   b  i do like several b movies because they  re hilarious  c  i like the godzilla movies  a lot  br    br   moving on  when the movie first comes on  it seems like it  s going to be your usual b movie  down to the crappy fx  but all a sudden  boom  the anime comes on  this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill  br    br   the animation is very bad   cheap  even worse than what i remember from speed racer  for crissakes  in fact  it  s so cheap  one of the few scenes from the movie i   vividly   remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school      it  s the same kids over   over again  the fx are terrible  too  the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla  in addition  the transition to live action to animation is unorganized  the dialogue   voices especially the english dub that i viewed  was horrid   i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd  vhs player  the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes   comments like the robots   joel mike on mst k  you pick the season   honestly  this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie   survive it at the same time  br    br   heck  i  m planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b movie night  because it  s stupid  pretty painful to watch   unintentionally hilarious at the same time  i  m giving this movie a       an improvement from the        i was originally going to give it  br    br    according to my grading scale       means pretty much both boring   bad  as fun as counting to three unless you find a way to make fun of it  then it will become as fun as counting to               this was the worst movie i saw at worldfest and it also received the least amount of applause afterwards  i can only think it is receiving such recognition based on the amount of known actors in the film  it s great to see j beals but she s only in the movie for a few minutes  m parker is a much better actress than the part allowed for  the rest of the acting is hard to judge because the movie is so ridiculous and predictable  the main character is totally unsympathetic and therefore a bore to watch  there is no real emotional depth to the story  a movie revolving about an actor who can t get work doesn t feel very original to me  nor does the development of the cop  it feels like one of many straight to video movies i saw back in the   s     and not even a good one in those standards  br    br             the karen carpenter story shows a little more about singer karen carpenter  s complex life  though it fails in giving accurate facts  and details  br    br   cynthia gibb  portrays karen  was not a fine election  she is a good actress   but plays a very naive and sort of dumb karen carpenter  i think that the role needed a stronger character  someone with a stronger personality  br    br   louise fletcher role as agnes carpenter is terrific  she does a great job as karen  s mother  br    br   it has great songs  which could have been included in a soundtrack album  unfortunately they weren  t  though this movie was on the top of the ratings in usa and other several countries             the cell   is an exotic masterpiece  a dizzying trip into not only the vast mind of a serial killer  but also into one of a very talented director  this is conclusive evidence of what can be achieved if human beings unleash their uninhibited imaginations  this is boldness at work  pushing aside thoughts to fall into formulas and cliches and creating something truly magnificent  this is the best movie of the year to date  br    br   i  ve read numerous complaints about this film  anywhere from all style and no substance to poorly cast characters and bad acting  to negatively criticize this film is to miss the point  this movie may be a landmark  a tradition where future movies will hopefully follow    the cell   has just opened the door to another world of imagination  so can we slam the door in its face and tell it and its director tarsem singh that we don  t want any more  personally  i would more than welcome another movie by tarsem  and would love to see someone try to challenge him  br    br   we  ve all heard talk about going inside the mind of a serial killer  and yes  i do agree that the   genre   is a bit overworked  the   s were full of movies trying to depict what makes serial killers tick  some of them worked  but most failed  but   the cell   does not blaze down the same trail  we are given a new twist  we are physically transported into the mind and presented with nothing less than a fascinating journey of the most mysterious subject matter ever studied  br    br   i like how the movie does not bog us down with too much scientific jargon trying to explain how jennifer lopez actually gets to enter the brain of another  instead  she just lies down on a laboratory table and is wrapped with what looks like really long twizzlers and jaunted into another entity    the cell   wants to let you   see   what it  s all about and not   how   it  s all about  and i guess that  s what some people don  t like  true  i do like explanations with my movies  but when a movie ventures onto new ground you must let it do what it desires and simply take it in  br    br   i noticed how the film was very dark when it showed reality  maybe to contrast the bright visuals when inside the brain of another  nonetheless  the set design was simply astonishing  i wouldn  t be surprised if this film took home a few oscars in cinematography  best costumes  best director and the like  if it were up to me it  d at least get nominated for best picture  br    br   i  ve noticed that i  ve kind of been repeating myself  not because there  s nothing else to say  but because i can  t stress enough how fantastic i thought   the cell   was  if you walk into the movie with a very open mind and to have it taken over with wonders and an eye popping feast then you are assured a good time  i guess this film was just a little too much for some people  writing it off as   weird   or   crazy    i am very much into psychology and the imagination of the human mind  so it was right down my alley  leaving the theater  i heard one audience member say   whoever made that movie sure did a lot of good drugs    if so  i want what he was smoking  br    br         out of              this film tried to be too many things all at once  stinging political satire  hollywood blockbuster  sappy romantic comedy  family values promo    the list goes on and on  it failed miserably at all of them  but there was enough interest to keep me from turning it off until the end  br    br   although i appreciate the spirit behind war  inc   it depresses me to see such a clumsy effort  especially when it will be taken by its targets to reflect the lack of the existence of a serious critique  rather than simply the poor writing  direction  and production of this particular film  br    br   there is a critique to be made about the corporatization of war  but poking fun at it in this way diminishes the true atrocity of what is happening  reminds me a bit of three kings  which similarly trivializes a genuine cause for concern            this movie was so frustrating  everything seemed energetic and i was totally prepared to have a good time  i at least thought i  d be able to stand it  but  i was wrong  first  the weird looping  it was like watching   america  s funniest home videos    the damn parents  i hated them so much  the stereo typical latino family  i need to speak with the person responsible for this  we need to have a talk  that little girl who was always hanging on someone  i just hated her and had to mention it  now  the final scene transcends  i must say  it  s so gloriously bad and full of badness that it is a movie of its own  what crappy dancing  horrible and beautiful at once              war movie   is a hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clich  d dialogue  rehashed plot and over the top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large scale combat  once in a while  however  a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen  the civil war era   cold mountain    starring jude law  nicole kidman and ren  e zellweger is such a film  br    br   then again  calling cold mountain   a war movie is not entirely accurate  true enough  the film opens with a  quite literally  quick and dirty battle sequence that puts   glory   director edward zwick shame  however    cold mountain   is not so much about the civil war itself as it is about the period and the people of the times  the story centers around disgruntled confederate soldier inman  played by jude law  who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of cold mountain  north carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind  ada monroe  played by nicole kidman  at first glance  this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier  s tribulations on the battlefield  indeed  the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived  br    br     cold mountain   soon takes a drastic turn  though  as the intrepid hero inman turns out to be a deserter  incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the confederates  and begins a long odyssey homeward  meanwhile  back at the farm  ada  s cultured ways prove of little use in the fields  soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast  coming to ada  s rescue is the course  tough as nails ruby thewes  played by ren  e zellweger  who helps ada put the farm back together and  perhaps more importantly  cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon ada  br    br   within these two settings  a vivid  compelling and  at times  very disturbing portrait of the war torn south unfolds  the characters with whom inman and ada interact are surprisingly complex  enhanced by wonderful performances of brendan gleeson as ruby  s deadbeat father  ray winstone as an unrepentant southern   lawman    and natalie portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother  all have been greatly affected and changed by   the war of northern aggression    mostly for the worse  the dark  pervading anti war message  accented by an effective  haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of virginia and north carolina  is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought  though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century  it  s hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant  br    br   director anthony minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film  but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters  the love story between inman and ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film  though the inherently distant  abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot  br    br   make no mistake    cold mountain   has neither the traits of a feel good romance nor an inspiring war drama  it is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether            taut and organically gripping  edward dmytryk  s crossfire is a distinctive suspense thriller  an unlikely   message   movie using the look and devices of the noir cycle  br    br   bivouacked in washington  dc  a company of soldiers cope with their restlessness by hanging out in bars  three of them end up at a stranger  s apartment where robert ryan  drunk and belligerent  beats their host  sam levene  to death because he happens to be jewish  police detective robert young investigates with the help of robert mitchum  who  s assigned to ryan  s outfit  suspicion falls on the second of the three  george cooper   who has vanished  ryan slays the third buddy  steve brodie  to insure his silence before young closes in  br    br   abetted by a superior script by john paxton  dmytryk draws precise performances from his three starring bobs  ryan  naturally  does his prototypical angry white male  and to the hilt   while mitchum underplays with his characteristic alert nonchalance  his role  however  is not central   young may never have been better  gloria grahame gives her first fully fledged rendition of the smart mouthed  vulnerable tramp  and  as a sad sack who  s leeched into her life  paul kelly haunts us in a small  peripheral role that he makes memorable  br    br   the politically engaged dmytryk perhaps inevitably succumbs to sermonizing  but it  s pretty much confined to young  s reminiscence of how his irish grandfather died at the hands of bigots a century earlier  thus  incidentally  stretching chronology to the limit   at least there  s no attempt to render an explanation  however glib  of why ryan hates jews  and hillbillies and      br    br   curiously  crossfire survives even the major change wrought upon it    the novel it  s based on  richard brooks   the brick foxhole  dealt with a gay bashing murder  but homosexuality in      was still beyond the pale  news of the holocaust had  however  begun to emerge from the ashes of europe  so hollywood felt emboldened to register its protest against anti semitism  the studios always quaked at the prospect of offending any potential ticket buyer   br    br   but while the change from homophobia to anti semitism works in general  the specifics don  t fit so smoothly  the victim  s chatting up a lonesome  drunk young soldier then inviting him back home looks odd  even though  or especially since  there  s a girlfriend in tow  it raises the question whether this scenario was retained inadvertently or left in as a discreet tip off to the original engine generating ryan  s murderous rage              ardh satya   is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema  directed by the great director govind nihalani  this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success  even today  ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india  br    br   the film tells the real life scenario of mumbai police of the   s  unlike any police of other cities in india  mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether  govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment  br    br   amongst various police officers   colleagues  the film describes the story of anand velankar  a young hot blooded cop coming from a poor family  his father is a harsh police constable  anand himself suffers from his father  s ideologies   incidences of his father  s atrocities on his mother  anand  s approach towards immediate action against crime  is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction  the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand  s constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors this leads to frustrations  as he cannot achieve the desired job satisfaction  resulting from the frustrations  his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms   bars  also turning him to an alcoholic  br    br   the spirit within him is still alive  as he constantly fights the system  he is aware of the system of the metro  where the police   politicians are a inertly associated by far end  his compromise towards unethical practice is negative  finally he gets suspended  br    br   the direction is a master piece   thoroughly hard core  one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty  s house to arrest him  followed by short conversation which is fantastic  at many scenes  the film has hair raising moments  br    br   the practical approach of script is a major punch  alcoholism  corruption  political influence  courage  deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today  those aspects are dealt brilliantly  br    br   finally  the films belongs to the one man show  om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly            my first exposure to the templarios   not a good one  i was excited to find this title among the offerings from anchor bay video  which has brought us other cult classics such as   spider baby    the print quality is excellent  but this alone can  t hide the fact that the film is deadly dull  there  s a thrilling opening sequence in which the villagers exact a terrible revenge on the templars    set the whole thing in motion   but everything else in the movie is slow  ponderous    ultimately  unfulfilling  adding insult to injury  the movie was dubbed  not subtitled  as promised on the video jacket            one of the most significant quotes from the entire film is pronounced halfway through by the protagonist  the mafia middle man titta di girolamo  a physically non descript  middle aged man originally from salerno in southern italy  when we  re introduced to him at the start of the film  he  s been living a non life in an elegant but sterile hotel in the italian speaking canton of switzerland for the last ten years  conducting a business we are only gradually introduced to  while this pivotal yet apparently unremarkable scene takes place employees of the the swiss bank who normally count di girolamo  s cash tell him that        dollars are missing from his usual suitcase full of tightly stacked banknotes  at the news  he quietly but icily threatens his coaxing bank manager of wanting to close down his account  meanwhile he tells us  the spectators  that when you bluff  you have to bluff right through to the end without fear of being caught out or appearing ridiculous  he says  you can  t bluff for a while and then halfway through  tell the truth  having eventually done this   bluffed only halfway through and told the truth  and having accepted the consequences of life and ultimately  love   is exactly the reason behind the beginning of titta di girolamo  s troubles   br    br   this initially unsympathetic character  a scowling  taciturn  curt man on the verge of     a man who won  t even reply in kind to chambermaids and waitresses who say hello and goodbye  becomes at one point someone the spectator cares deeply about  at one point in his non life  titta decides to feel concern about appearing   ridiculous    the first half of the film may be described as   slow   by some  it does indeed reveal di girolamo  s days and nights in that hotel at an oddly disjoined  deliberate pace  revealing seemingly mundane and irrelevant details  however  scenes that may have seemed unnecessary reveal just how essential they are as this masterfully constructed and innovative film unfolds before your eyes  the existence of titta di girolamo   the man with no imagination  identity or life  the unsympathetic character you unexpectedly end up loving and feeling for when you least thought you would   is also conveyed with elegantly edited sequences and very interesting use of music  one theme by the scottish band boards of canada especially stood out    br    br   never was the contrast between the way hollywood and italy treat mobsters more at odds than since the release of films such as le conseguenze dell  amore or l  imbalsamatore  another interesting element was the way in which the film made use of the protagonist  s insomnia  not unlike the machinist  and in a far more explicit way  the al pacino film insomnia   le conseguenze dell  amore uses this condition to symbolise a deeper emotional malaise that  s been rammed so deep into the obscurity of the unconscious  it  s almost impossible to pin point its cause  if indeed there is one    br    br   the young and sympathetic hotel waitress sofia  played by olivia magnani  grand daughter of the legendary anna  and the memory of titta  s best friend  a man whom he hasn  t seen in    years  unexpectedly provide a tiny window onto life that titta eventually  though tentatively at first  accepts to look through again  though it  s never explicitly spelt out  the spectator knows that to a man like titta  accepting the consequences of love will have unimaginable consequences  a film without a single scene of sex or violence  a film that unfolds in its own time and concedes nothing to the spectator  s expectations  le conseguenze dell  amore is a fine representative of that small  quiet  discreet renaissance that has been taking place in italian cinema since the decline of cinecitt  xa  during the second half of the   s  the world is waiting for italy to produce more il postino like fare  more la vita    bella style films    neglecting to explore fine creations like le conseguenze dell  amore  l  imbalsamatore and others  your loss  world            i watched this film not really expecting much  i got it in a pack of   films  all of which were pretty terrible in their own way for under a fiver so what could i expect  and you know what i was right  they were all terrible  this movie has a few  and a few is stretching it  interesting points  the occasional camcorder view is a nice touch  the drummer is very like a drummer  i e damned annoying and  well thats about it actually  the problem is that its just so boring  in what i can only assume was an attempt to build tension  a whole lot of nothing happens and when it does its utterly tedious  i had my thumb on the fast forward button  ready to press for most of the movie  but gave it a go  and seriously is the lead singer of the band that great looking  coz they don  t half mention how beautiful he is a hell of a lot  i thought he looked a bit like a meercat  all this and i haven  t even mentioned the killer  i  m not even gonna go into it  its just not worth explaining  anyway as far as i  m concerned star and london are just about the only reason to watch this and with the exception of london  who was actually quite funny  it wasn  t because of their acting talent  i  ve certainly seen a lot worse  but i  ve also seen a lot better  best avoid unless your bored of watching paint dry            i bought this film at blockbuster for        because it sounded interesting  a bit ranma esque  with the idea of someone dragging around a skeleton   because there was a cute girl in a mini skirt on the back  and because there was a restricted viewing sticker on it  i thought it was going to be a sweet or at least sincere coming of age story with a weird indie edge  i was      wrong  br    br   having watched it  i have to wonder how it got the restricted sticker  since there is hardly any foul language  little violence  and the closest thing to nudity  honestly  i don  t usually go around hoping for it   is when the girl is in her nightgown and you see her panties  you see her panties a lot in this movie  because no matter what  she  s wearing a miniskirt of some sort   even the anti religious humor is tame  and lame  caricatured  insincere  derivative  unoriginal  and worst of all not funny in the slightest  it would be better just to listen to ray stevens     would jesus wear a rolex on his television show     this would barely qualify as pg     it is not rated   but blockbuster refuses to let anyone under the age of    rent this  as if it was pornographic  any little kid could go in there and rent the edited version of requiem for a dream  but they insist that zack and reba is worse  br    br   it is  but not in that way  br    br   in a way  this worries me  the only thing left that could offend people is the idea of the suicide at the beginning  if anybody needs to see movies with honestly portrayed suicides  not this one  but better ones like the virgin suicides   it  s teenagers  if both of those movies were rated r purely because of the suicide aspect  then i have little chance of turning a story i  ve been writing into a pg    movie  the main characters are eleven and a half and twelve   suicide is one of the top three leading causes of death in teenagers  i think it  s number     so chances are that most teens have been or will be affected by it  br    br   just say no to this movie  though                  the plot is about the death of little children  hopper is the one who has to investigate the killings  during the movie it appears that he has some troubles with his daughter  in the end the serial killer get caught  that  s it  but before you find out who dunnit  you have to see some terrible acting by all of the actors  it is unbelievable how bad these actors are  including hopper  i could go on like this but that to much of a waste of my time  just don  t watch the movie  i  ve warned you            ever watched a movie that lost the plot  well  this didn  t even really have one to begin with  br    br   where to begin  the achingly tedious scenes of our heroine sitting around the house with actually no sense of menace or even foreboding created even during the apparently constant thunderstorms  that are strangely never actually heard in the house great double glazing   the house that is apparently only a few miles from a town yet is several hours walk away    or the third girl who serves no purpose to the plot except to provide a surprisingly quick gory murder just as the tedium becomes unbearable  or even the beginning which suggests a spate of     killings throughout the area even though it is apparent the killer never ventures far from the house  or the bizarre ritual with the salt   pepper that pretty much sums up most of the films inherent lack of direction  br    br   add a lead actress who can  t act but at least is willing to do some completely irrelevant nude shower scenes and this video is truly nasty  but not in the way you hope  br    br   given a following simply for being banned in the uk in the     s  mostly because of a final surprisingly over extended murder  it offers nothing but curiosity value  and one classic   daft   murder  don  t worry its telegraphed at least ten minutes before   br    br   after a walk in the woods our victim comes to a rather steep upward slope which they obviously struggle up  halfway through they see a figure at the top dressed in black and brandishing a large scythe  what do they do  slide down and run like the rest of us  no  of course not  they struggle to the top and stand conveniently nice and upright in front of the murder weapon  br    br   it really is only a movie as they say             okay  so this series kind of takes the route of   here we go again    week in  week out david morse  s character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle   but what  s wrong with that   david morse is one of the greatest character actors out there  and certainly the coolest  and to have him in a series created by david koepp   a great writer   is heaven   br    br   due to the lack of love for this show by many  i can  t see it going to a season series   but you never know  the amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me   let  s hope something good can make it past a first series              after sitting through this pile of dung  my husband and i wondered whether it was actually the product of an experiment to see whether a computer program could produce a movie  it was that listless and formulaic  but the u s  propaganda thrown in your face throughout the film proves  disappointingly  that it  s the work of humans  call me a conspiracy theorist  but quotes like    we have to steal the declaration of independence to protect it   seem like ways to justify actions like the invasion of iraq  etc  the fact that nicholas cage spews lines like    i would never use the declaration of independence as a bargaining chip   with a straight face made me and my husband wonder whether the entire cast took valium before shooting each scene  the   reasoning   behind each plot turn and new   clue   is truly ridiculous and impossible to follow  and there  s also a bonus side plot of misogyny  with dr  whatever her name was being chided by all involved for   never shutting up    she  s clearly in the movie only for looks  but they felt the need to slap a   dr    title on her character to give her some gravity  at one point  cage  s character says    don  t you ever shut up    and the camera pans to her looking poutily down at her hands  like she  s a child  truly grotesque  the only benefit to this movie was that it  s so astonishingly bad  you do get a few laughs out of it  the really scary thing is that a majority of the people watching the movie with us seemed to enjoy it  creepy               it had all the clich  s of movies of this type and no substance  the plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie i felt like a sucker for watching it  the production was good  however  the script and acting were b movie quality  the casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors  the good actors didn  t hold their own nor did they lift up the others   br    br   this movie is not worthy of more words  but i will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines  james wood and cuba gooding  jr  play caricatures of themselves in other movies   br    br   if you are looking for mindless entertainment  i still wouldn  t recommend this movie            this movie is based on the book    a many splendored thing   by han suyin and tackles issues of race relations between asians and whites  a topic that comes from han  s personal experiences as an eurasian growing up in china  that background  and the beautiful hong kong settings  gives this love story a unique and rather daring atmosphere for its time  br    br   other than that  the story is a stereotypical romance with a memorable song that is perhaps more remembered than the movie itself  the beautiful jennifer jones looks the part and gives a wonderful  oscar nominated performance as a doctor of mixed breed during the advent of communism in mainland china  william holden never looked better playing a romantic lead as a journalist covering war torn regions in the world  the acting is top notch  and the chemistry between the two lovers provides for some genuine moments of silver screen affection sure to melt the hearts of those who are romantically inclined  br    br   the cinematography really brings out fifty  s hong kong  especially the hilltop overlooking the harbor where the two lovers spend their most intimate moments  the ending is a real tear jerker  some may consider sentimental romances pass    but  for those who enjoy classic hollywood love stories  this is a shining example            of all the films i have seen  this one  the rage  has got to be one of the worst yet  the direction  logic  continuity  changes in plot script and dialog made me cry out in pain    how could anyone come up with something so crappy    gary busey is know for his   b   movies  but this is a sure   w   movie   w waste   br    br   take for example  about two dozen fbi   local law officers surround a trailer house with a jeep wagoneer  inside the jeep is ma and is   confused   as to why all the cops are about  within seconds a huge gun battle ensues  ma being killed straight off  the cops blast away at the jeep with gary and company blasting away at them  the cops fall like dominoes and the jeep with gary drives around in circles and are not hit by one single bullet pellet  ma is killed and gary seems to not to have noticed damn that guy is tough  truly a miracle  not since the six shooter held     bullets has there been such a miracle            i had heard good things about   states of grace   and came in with an open mind  i thought that   god  s army   was okay  and i thought that maybe dutcher had improved and matured as a filmmaker  the film began with some shaky acting  and i thought    well  maybe it will get better    unfortunately  it never did  the picture starts out by introducing two elders    mormon missionaries    and it seems that the audience will get to know them and grow to care about them  instead  the story degenerates into a highly improbable series of unfortunate events highlighting blatant disobedience by the missionaries  something that undeniably exists  but rarely on the level that dutcher portrays  and it becomes almost laughable  br    br   dutcher  s only success in this movie is his successful alienation of his target audience  by unrealistically and inaccurately portraying the lives of mormon missionaries  dutcher accomplishes nothing more than angering his predominantly mormon audience  the film in no way reflects reality  missions are nothing like what dutcher shows  having served a mormon mission myself i can attest to this fact  and gang life in california certainly contains much more explicit language than the occasional mild vulgarity  br    br   the conclusion  which i  m assuming was supposed to touch the audience and inspire them to believe that forgiveness is available to all  was both unbelievable  c  mon  the entire mission gathers to see this elder sent home    and the mom and the girl are standing right next to each other   and cheesy  next time  dutcher  try making a movie that someone can identify with            this movie struck home for me  being     i remember the       s and my father working in a factory  i figured  if i worked hard too  if i had pride and never gave up i too could have the american dream  the house  a few kids  a car all to call my own  i  ve noted however  without a degree in something  unlike my father that quit at ninth grade  and a keen sense of greed and laziness  you can  t get anywhere  br    br   i would like to know if anyone has this movie on dvd or vhs  it  s made for tv  and i just saw it an hour ago  ic an  t find it anywhere  i  d love to show this to my friends  my pseudo friends  family and other relatives  see what they think and remind them that once upon a time  americans would work for the sake of feeling honor and that we had pride in what we accomplished   i think the feeling is still there  but in a heavy downward spiral with so many things being made overseas              as a disclaimer  i  ve seen the movie     times in the last    years  and i only just saw the musical this week  this allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn  t in the musical  however  it tainted me when i watched the musical       br    br   i actually believe michael douglas worked quite well in that role  along with kasey  i think her   let me dance for you scene   is one of the best parts of the movie  a worthwhile addition compared to the musical  the dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical  as well as the cast which is at least    times bigger  easier to do in the movie of course   the decors  lighting  dancing  and singing are also much superior in the movie  which should be expected  and was indeed delivered   br    br   the songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie  the new ones are quite good ones  and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion  especially compared to a musical which has few decors  the one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking  and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters  but their dancing is impeccable  and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical          protocol is an implausible movie whose only saving grace is that it stars goldie hawn along with a good cast of supporting actors  the story revolves around a ditzy cocktail waitress who becomes famous after inadvertently saving the life of an arab dignitary  the story goes downhill halfway through the movie and goldie s charm just doesn t save this movie  unless you are a goldie hawn fan don t go out of your way to see this film           how this film could be classified as drama  i have no idea  if i were john voight and mary steenburgen  i would be trying to erase this from my cv  it was as historically accurate as xena and hercules  abraham and moses got melded into noah  lot  abraham  s nephew  lot  turns up thousands of years before he would have been born  canaanites wandered the earth   really  what were the scriptwriters thinking  was it just ignorance    i remember something about noah and animals  and lot and canaanites and all that stuff from sunday school    or were they trying to offend the maximum number of people on the planet as possible  from christians  jews and muslims  to historians  archaeologists  geologists  psychologists  linguists    as a matter of fact  did anyone not get offended  anyone who had even a modicum of taste would have winced at this one            preston sturgis   the power and the glory was unseen by the public for nearly twenty or thirty years until the late     s when it resurfaced and even showed up on television  in the meantime it had gained in notoriety because pauline kael  s the citizen kane book had suggested that the herman mankiewicz   orson welles screenplay for kane was based on sturgis   screenplay here  as is mentioned in the beginning of this thread for the film on the imdb web site  kael overstated her case  br    br   there are about six narrators who take turns dealing with the life of charles foster kane  the newsreel  representing ralston   the henry luce clone   thatcher  s memoirs  bernstein  jed leland  susan alexander kane  and raymond the butler  each has his or her different slant on kane  reflecting their faith or disappointment or hatred of the man  and of course each also reveals his or her own failings when they are telling their version of kane  s story  this method also leads to frequent overlapping re tellings of the same incident  br    br   this is not the situation in the power and the glory  yes  like kane it is about a legendary business leader   here it is tom garner  spencer tracy   a man who rose from the bottom to being head of the most successful railroad system in the country  but there are only two narrators   they are garner  s right hand man henry  ralph morgan  and his wife  sarah padden   this restricts the nearly three dimensional view we get at times of kane in garner  henry  when he narrates  is talking about his boss and friend  whom he respected and loved  his wife is like the voice of the skeptical public   she sees only the flaws in henry  br    br   typical example  although he worked his way up  tom becomes more and more anti labor in his later years  unions are troublemakers  and he does not care to be slowed down by their shenanigans  henry describes tom  s confrontation with the union in a major walk out  and how it preoccupied him to the detriment of his home life  but henry  s wife reminds him how tom used scabs and violence to end the strike  apparently blowing up the union  s headquarters   killing many people   so we have two views of the man but one is pure white and one is pure black  br    br   i  m not really knocking the power and the glory for not duplicating kane  s success  few films do   including all of orson welles   other films   but i am aware that the story is presented well enough to hold one  s interest to the end  and thanks to the performances of tracy and colleen moore as his wife sally  the tragedy of the worldly success of the pair is fully brought home  br    br   when they marry  tom wants to do well  in part  to give his wife and their family the benefits he never had  but in america great business success comes at a cost  tom gets deeply involved with running the railroad empire  he expands it and improves it constantly   but it takes him away from home too much  and he loses touch with sally  and he also notices eve  helen vinson   the younger woman who becomes his mistress  when sally learns of his unfaithful behavior it destroys her  br    br   similarly tom too gets a full shock  which makes him a martyr in the eyes of henry   eve marries tom  and presents him with a son   but it turns out to be eve  s son by tom  s son tom jr   philip trent   the discovery of this incestuous cuckolding causes tom to shoot himself  br    br   the film is not a total success   the action jumps at times unconvincingly  yet it does make the business seem real  note the scene when tom tells his board of directors about his plans to purchase a small rival train line  and he discusses the use of debentures for financing the plans   sturgis came from a wealthy background  so he could bring in this type of detail  so on the whole it is a first rate film  no citizen kane perhaps  but of interest to movie lovers as an attempt at business realism with social commentary in depression america            average  and surprisingly tame  fulci giallo which means it  s still quite bad by normal standards  but redeemed by its solid build up and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyance  br    br   the genre  s well known weaknesses are in full gear  banal dialogue  wooden acting  illogical plot points  and the finale goes on much too long  while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall i say  limp affair  br    br   fulci  s ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing  though  yellow clues wherever you look  br    br     out of    limping killers           return to the   th chamber is one of those classic kung fu movies which shaw produces back in the   s and   s  whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of hollywood  and the protagonist gordon liu  the counterpart to the western  s clint eastwood  digitally remastered and a new print made for the fantastic film fest  this is   presented in shaw scope    just like the good old days  br    br   this film is a simple story of good versus evil  told in   acts  which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era  br    br   act one sets up the premise  workers in a dye mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot  having their wages cut by     by incoming manchu gangsters  they can  t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters  and their boss  at first they had a minor success in getting liu to impersonate a highly skilled shaolin monk  one of the best comedy sequences   but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times  br    br   act two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob  however  without real martial arts  he embarks on a journey to shaolin temple  to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly  after some slapstick moments  he finally gets accepted by the abbot  whom he impersonated   but is disappointed at the teaching methods   kinda like mr miyagi  s style in karate kid  but instead of painting fences  he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple  nothing can keep a good man down  and he unwittingly builds strength  endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way  br    br   act three is where the fight fest begins  with cheesy sound effects  each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment  but it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here  with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners  and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles  you may find the speed of fights a tad too slow  with some pause in between moves  but with yuen wo ping and his style being used ad nausem in hollywood flicks  they sure don  t make fight scenes like they used to  return to the   th chamber gets a repeat screening on monday  so  if you  re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane  what are you waiting for

it requires tremendous skill  pacing  patience  directorial   distance    a plausible premise  a narrative   flow    and really believable acting  aka great acting    br    br   such is not the case with   love machine    it starts to show its faux hand about the    minute mark  with    minutes left to watch   and the viewer starts to realize that he or she is being taken in  it  s downhill from there  br    br   director gordon eriksen simply peaked too soon  but to be fair to eriksen  his problems started early  as he explains in the extras  he began wanting to do a real doc  couldn  t get funding  and settled for a cheaper way of making his film  br    br   the premise    people who have secret lives by posting themselves on a porn website    was perhaps more interesting in          when the film was made  eriksen does a lot of tricky stuff    a pushy   host    hand held cameras  zooms  grainy blacks and whites    all  i guess  to elicit a sense of authenticity  but it just doesn  t work  the film is confusing and forced  but what ultimately brings it down is the believability of the actors and the pretty awful dialogue            the hills have eyes ii is what you would expect it to be and nothing more  of course it  s not going to be an oscar nominated film  it  s just pure entertainment which you can just lose yourself in for    minutes  br    br   the plot is basically about a group of national guard trainees who find themselves battling against the notorious mutated hillbillies on their last day of training in the desert  it  s just them fighting back throughout the whole film  which includes a lot of violence  which is basically the whole film  as blood and guts are constantly flying around throughout the whole thing  and also yet another graphic rape scene which is pointlessly thrown in to shock the audience  br    br   i  d give the hills have eyes ii   out of    for pure entertainment  and that only  although even then i found myself looking at my watch more and more as the film went on  as it began to drag due to the fact it continued to try and shock the audience with graphic gore and the occasional jump scene just to make sure the audience stays awake  the hills have eyes ii is just decent entertainment  something to pass time if you  re bored  and nothing else  br    br                  i laughed all the way through this rotten movie  it  s so unbelievable  a woman leaves her husband after many years of marriage  has a breakdown in front of a real estate office  what happens  the office manager comes outside and offers her a job    hilarious  next thing you know the two women are going at it  yep  they  re lesbians  nothing rings true in this   lifetime for women with nothing better to do   movie  clunky dialogue like   i don  t want to spend the rest of my life feeling like i had a chance to be happy and didn  t take it   doesn  t help  there  s a wealthy  distant mother who disapproves of her daughter  s new relationship  a sassy black maid   unbelievable that in the year       a film gets made in which there  s a sassy black maid  hattie mcdaniel must be turning in her grave  the woman

rebecca based upon daphne dumarier  s lush novel of gothic romance and intrigue  he returned to some of the more familiar themes of his early british period   mistaken identity and espionage  as the u s  settled into world war ii and the large scale   war effort   of civilians building planes  weaponry and other necessary militia  the booming film entertainment business began turning out paranoid and often jingoistic thrillers with war time themes  these thrillers often involved networks of deceptive and skilled operators at work in the shadows among the good  law abiding citizens  knowing the director was at home in this espionage genre  producer jack skirball approached hitchcock about directing a property he owned that dealt with corruption  war time sabotage and a helpless hero thrust into a vortex of coincidence and mistaken identity  the darker elements of the narrative and the sharp wit of literary maven dorothy parker  during her brief stint in hollywood before returning to her bohemian roots in nyc  who co authored the script were a perfect match for hitchcock  s sensibilities  br    br   this often neglected film tells the story of the unfortunate    year old barry kane  robert cummings  who  while at work at a los angeles airplane factory  meets new employee frank frye  norman lloydd  and moments later is framed for committing sabotage  fleeing the authorities who don  t believe his far fetched story he meets several characters on his way to soda city utah and finally new york city  these memorable characters include a circus caravan with a car full of helpful   freaks   and a popular billboard model patricia martin  priscilla lane  who  during the worst crisis of his life as well as national security  he falls madly in love with  of course in the land of hitchcock  patricia  kidnapped by the supposed saboteur barry  falls for her captor thus adding romantic tension to the mix  br    br   in good form for this outing  hitchcock brews a national network of demure old ladies  average joes  and respectable businessmen who double as secret agent terrorists that harbor criminals  pull guns and detonate bombs to keep things moving  it  s a terrific plot that takes its time moving forward and once ignited  culminates in one of hitchcock  s more memorable finales  look for incredibly life like nyc tourist attractions  all of which were recreated by art directors in hollywood due to the war time   shooting ban   on public attractions   while saboteur may not be one of hitchcock  s most well known films  it  s a popular b movie that is certainly solid and engaging with plenty of clever plot twists and as usual   terrific hitchcock villains  remember to look for hitchcock  s cameo appearance outside a drug store in the second half of the film  hitchcock  s original cameo idea that was shot  him fighting in sign language with his   deaf   wife  was axed by the bureau of standards and practices who were afraid of offending the deaf            i just watched the dresser this evening  having only seen it once before  about a dozen years ago  br    br   it  s not a   big   movie  and doesn  t try to make a big splash  but my god  the brilliance of the two leads leaves me just about speechless  albert finney and tom courtenay are nothing less than amazing in this movie  br    br   the dresser is the story of sir  an aging shakespearean actor  finney   and his dresser norman  courtenay   sort of a valet  putting on a production of king lear during the blitz of london in world war ii  these are two men  each dependent upon the other  sir is almost helpless without the aid of norman to cajole  wheedle  and bully him into getting onstage for his    th performance of lear  and norman lives his life vicariously through sir  without sir to need him  he is nothing  or thinks he is  anyway  br    br   this is a character driven film  the plot is secondary to the interaction of the characters  and as such  it requires actors of the highest caliber to bring it to life  finney  only    years old  is completely believable as a very old  very sick  petulant  bullying  but brilliant stage actor  he hisses and fumes at his fellow actors even when they  re taking their bows  and courtenay is no less convincing as the mincing dresser  who must sometimes act more as a mother than as a valet to his elderly employer  employer is really the wrong term to use  though  for although  technically their relationship is that of employer and employee  most of the time sir and norman act like nothing so much as an old married couple  br    br   yes  there are others in the cast of this movie  but there is no question that the true stars are finney  courtenay  and the marvelous script by ronald harwood  that is not to say that there aren  t other fine performances  most notably eileen atkins as the long suffering stage manager madge  there is a wonderful scene where sir and madge talk about old desires  old regrets  and what might have been  br    br   although it doesn  t get talked about these days  it is worth remembering that the dresser was nominated for five academy awards  best actor nominations for both finney and courtenay  best picture  best director  peter yates   and best adapted screenplay  br    br   i had remembered this as being a good movie  but i wasn  t prepared to be as completely mesmerized as i was from beginning to end  if you want to see an example of what great acting is all about  and be hugely entertained all the while  then i encourage you to see the dresser            what happened  what we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast  but somewhere the movie loses it  actually  it never really got going  there was a little excitement when we find out that angie is not really pregnant  then find out that she is after all  but that was it  steve martin  who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie  was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie  other than to make it longer  i really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters  kate and angie  and maybe try not for a pure comedy  which unfortunately it was not  but maybe a drama with comedic elements  i think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here i can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot            i  ve just watched fingersmith  and i  m stunned to see the      average rating for the show  br    br   not only was the plot was difficult to follow  but it seems character development was randomly applied  br    br   the actors were adequate  but in the process of attempting to create twists and turns  their characters are rendered entirely one dimensional  once this happens  the story really falls flat and becomes tedious  br    br   and just in case anyone didn  t see the predictable lesbian undertones from miles way  this is hammered home in the most banal terms at the end of the film  br    br   the end scene is disappointing and phoned in  and anyone who sat back and went   ohhh  so they were carpet munchers all along     must have been out for the evening  br    br   two stars for the tonsil hockey in the earlier scene which was at least a bit raunchy  none for the rest of it              so let  s begin     br    br   the movie itself is as original as cronenberg  s movies would usually appear    br    br   my intention to see it was certainly jjl being one of my favourite actresses  she is as lovely as usual  this cutie  br    br   i would not say it was my favourite movie of hers  still it  s quite interesting and entertaining to follow   br    br   the rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array     br    br   recommend with confidence                besides being boring  the scenes were oppressive and dark  the movie tried to portray some kind of moral  but fell flat with its message  what were the redeeming qualities   on top of that  i don  t think it could make librarians look any more unglamorous than it did            an unmarried woman named stella  bette midler  gets pregnant by a wealthy man  stephen collins   he offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own  things go ok until the child named jenny  trini alvarado  becomes a teenager and things gradually  and predictably  become worse  br    br   i  ve seen both the silent version and sound version of   stella dallas    neither one affected me much  and i cry easily  but they were well made if dated  trying to remake this in      was just a stupid idea  i guess midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of   beaches   to get this made  this  predictably  bombed  the story is laughable and dated by today  s standards  even though midler and alvarado give good performances this film really drags and i was bored silly by the end  stephen collins and marsha mason  both good actors  don  t help in supporting roles  flimsy and dull  really  who thought this would work  see the      stanwyck version instead  i give this a              don  t torture a duckling is one of fulci  s earlier  and honestly  in terms of story line  better     films   and although not the typical   bloodbath   that fulci is known for   this is still a very unique and enjoyable film  br    br   the story surrounds a small town where a series of child murders are occurring  some of the colorful characters involved in the investigations   either as suspects  or those   helping   the investigation  or in some cases both    include the towns police force  a small time reporter  a beautiful and rich ex drug addict  a young priest and his mother  an old man who practices witchcraft and his female prot  g    a mentally handicapped townsman  and a deaf mute little girl  all of these people are interwoven into the plot to create several twists and turns  until the actual killer is revealed    br    br   don  t torture a duckling is neither a   classical   giallo or a typical fulci gore film  although it does contain elements of both   it is more of an old fashioned murder mystery  with darker subject matter and a few scenes of graphic violence  although nothing nearly as strong as some of fulci  s later works   this is a well written film with lots of twists that kept me guessing up until the end  recommended for giallo murder mystery fans  or anyone looking to check out some of fulci  s non splatter films   but don  t despair  don  t torture still has more than it  s fair share of violence and sleaze  some may be put off by the subject of the child killings  and one main female character has a strange habit of hitting on very young boys  which is also kind of disconcerting   but if that type of material doesn  t bother you  then definitely give this one a look                   busty beauty stacie randall plays pvc clad  bad ass bitch alexandra  the faithful acolyte of faust  an evil entity trapped in hell  determined to free her master  the malevolent minx breaks into a warehouse to steal a magical gem vital to her success  but whilst conducting a satanic ritual to summon faust  the silly mare accidentally enters the pentagram she has drawn on the floor  which results in the loss of the gem and the release of two diminutive  troll like creatures called lite and dark  br    br   now alexandra must find a replacement gem  which isn  t going to be easy  the only other stone that will do the trick is worn around the neck of her ex lover  police detective jonathan graves  peter liapis   who is investigating the warehouse robbery and who knows only too well what evil alexandra is capable of  meanwhile  wise cracking inter dimensional half pints lite and dark get into all sorts of zany trouble as they try to find a way back home  br    br   in the warped movie world of jim wynorski  all females are big breasted babes with the fashion sense of a cheap hooker  ghoulies iv is no exception  every woman in this film  whether she be a police captain  a curator of antiquities  or a mental patient in an asylum  is hot  hot  hot and wears not a lot  and it  s this fact that makes this otherwise totally unwatchable piece of stv crap just about bearable  br    br   but be warned  even though the presence of semi naked  quality crumpet makes the going slightly easier  there is still plenty about this film to warrant it being labelled as an ordeal  the acting is wooden and the dialogue is painful  the black humour  as the dvd blurb describes it  is about as funny as a knee to the knackers  with the comedic banter of lite and dark being particularly cringe worthy  and the special effects are bargain basement  consisting of rubbery creatures and visual effects that would have looked dated ten years earlier  br    br        solely for the high bimbo quotient            i really like salman kahn so i was really disappointed when i seen this movie  it didn  t have much of a plot and what they did have was not that appealing  salman however did look good in the movie looked young and refreshed but was worth the price of this dvd  the music was not bad it was quite nice  usually indian movies are at least two to three hours long but this was a very short movie for an indian film  the american actress that played in the movie is from the television hit series heroes  ali larter  her acting had a lot to be desired  however she did look good in the indian dresses that she wore  all the movie had not a lot to be desired and i hope salman does a lot better on his next movie  thank you            i  m not sure why the producers needed to trade on the name of a somewhat successful movie franchise because the title suggests that it is a sequel to the first three movies  which it is not  even though marques houston did appear in   hp     he played a totally different character  he was  eight years older  in this film  okay   so reid and martin weren  t the most talented and couldn  t carry a film all by themselves  but to trade on the hp franchise seems to me that there could have made some sort of reference  albeit minor  to the earlier movies  i  m sure everyone who wanted to see it was   hoodwinked    into thinking that they were seeing a sequel  not a totally different film with a familiar name  and i  m sorry   kym whitley is not funny  and could not hold a candle to the late robin harris  ketty lester  or dc curry in the earlier films  although meagen good and mari morrow are a substantial visual diversion   i have to give this a thumbs down   just naming the film   down to the last minute   would have been ok  furthermore  the hudlin brothers  who produced the first three movies  were not involved in the making of this film            this film laboured along with some of the most predictable story lines and shallow characters ever seen  the writer obviously bought the playbook   how to write a space disaster movie   and followed it play by play  in particular  the stereo typical use of astronauts talking to their loved ones from outer space   putting on a brave show in the face of disaster   has been done time and time again  br    br   max q appears to have been written in the hope that the producers would throw     million at the project  but  judging by the latter half of the film which contained numerous lame attempts at special effects  the producers could only muster     thousand  to learn that the film was nominated for a   special visual effects   emmy has me absolutely gob smacked  br    br   i think a handful of high school students with a pass in media studies could have created more believable effects  br    br   and the plot holes are too numerous to mention  but i will pick one out as an example  now  i  m no nasa expert  but surely it  s highly implausible that a worker attached to the shuttle simulator would suddenly hold a position of power in the control room when things start to go pear shaped with the program  surely there is someone more experienced at mission control who the program director would call on rather than a twenty nine year old who has not been in the control room before  br    br   the only saving grace for this film is the work of bill campbell  he manages to make a good attempt at salvaging something out of the train wreck that is this script  br    br   i give this film   out of     with the above average work of bill campbell in the lead role saving it from a lower mark            caddyshack two is a good movie by itself but compared to the original it cant stack up  robert stack is a horrible replacement for ted knight and jackie mason  while funny just cant compete with rodney dangerfield  ty webb is funny  being the only character from the original  most of the other characters in the movie lack the punch of the original  henry wilcoxon for example  except for the hystericly funny lawyer peter blunt  being played by randy quaid  every line he says reminds me of the originals humor  especially the scene at his office  i don  t go in for law suits or motions  i find out where you live and come to your house and beat down your door with a f   ing baseball bat  make a bonfire with the chippindale maybe roast that golden retriever  arff arff arff  then eat it  and then i  m comin   upstairs junior  and i  m grabbing you by your brooks brothers pjs  and cramming your brand new bmw up your tight a    do we have an understanding    offsetting his small role however  is dan acroyd  who is obviously no replacement for bill murray  his voice is beyond irritating and everything he does isnt even funny  its just stupid  overall caddyshack ii is a good movie  but in comparison to the awesome original it just cant cut it            honestly   this short film sucks  the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience  the unearthed dvd is crisp and clear and i haven  t made up my mind if this helps or hinders it  if the film was a little grainy it might have added some   creepiness factor   to what was going on  i have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter   but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like nekromantik and visitor q among others  are more shocking than in aftermath  all this talk about the film being about loneliness and all other manner of deep philosophy is bull      this is an expensive  beautifully filmed turd  it  s not that shocking  it  s not that disgusting  if you insist on viewing it   rent it  i give it a   for the fact that not many people make explicit movies about necrophilia  there should definitely be a bigger selection for us sickos      the filming is good and it does have some   gore    if watching a rubbery looking doll get cut open is considered gore     but other than that   absolutely nothing going for this over hyped mess  on the other hand   genesis   cerda  s   sequel   to aftermath  now available as a   double feature   released by unearthed films  is an absolute masterpiece of a short film  really showing what a good director cerda really is when given the right material  although i don  t care for aftermath at all  genesis is so well made that i will forgive cerda and definitely keep an eye out for him in the future              i thought that mukhsin has been wonderfully written  its not just about entertainment  there  s tonnes of subtle messages that i think yasmin was trying to bring across  and yes  it might be confusing to some of you especially if you didn  t watch sepet and or gubra for    times   br    br   i bet u noticed how they use characters from the two movies before right  its really ironic how the characters relate  like the bossy neighbour is that prostitute from gubra  and the chick at the snooker pad turns out to be the religious and wife of the pious man in the future   br    br   and i absolutely love the voice overs  its crude yet awakeningly fresh  like  when they took a shot of the rumah tumpangan gamin signboard  then there was suddenly mukhsin  s voice saying   bismillahhirrahmannirrahim      the scene when he climbed the tree   br    br   it captured malaysian  s attitude and in some mild way  sniggering at how pathetic it is  portrayed in the character  for example  even the kids can be really sharp tongued complete with the shrill annoying voice  and simply bad mouth ppl all movie long  and how you can be such a busybody and talk about ppl  when ur own life isn  t sorted out   br    br   all i can say is  this movie totally reached my expectation if not exceeded it   br    br   it kept me glued to the screen  i couldn  t even take my eyes off it  not even to make out in the cinema  ha ha            i am not a golf fan by any means  on may    about       pm the movie started with a scene in the late       s  old movies i like but not golf however  within the first scene a young boy  harry vardon  is awaken by the voices of men  he goes outside to inquire what they are doing and is told they are going to build a golf something    so   then i turned the television off but something stirred me and it was back on  the movie is excellent  we then see this young boy now a man  professional golf player who is haunted with visions from his childhood  then we meet the true focus of the movie francis and the decisions he makes for golf  you meet his mother and father who want to protect him from the class thing that is so obvious during the period  then there is little eddie lowery his caddy with encouraging words and little pushes that are instrumental in francis winning  don  t want to give away too much   i was up until   a m  this is super please see the movie            upon viewing tobe hooper  s gem  crocodile  in       i developed a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre  i look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness  if only ed wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts  with ed writing the scripts  and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer  all we  d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with russ meyer breasts and ren hoek pectoral implants  br    br   while tobe hooper  s crocky opus referenced his own movies  blood surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies  see if you can look past the revenge of the nerds sequel sets to find the allusions homages  rip offs to jaws  temple of doom  indiana jones   last crusade  the convent  godzilla       and any james bond movie  also  try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock  br    br   i was disappointed the crock didn  t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism   or crocky appreciation  but the quasi captain ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach  perhaps  in the coming years  we  ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset  or hopefully  a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero g monkey midget crocodile bloodshed  br    br   all in all  the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me            it tries to be the epic adventure of the century  and with a cast like sh   kasugi  christopher lee and john rhys davies it really is the perfect b adventure of all time  it  s actually is a pretty fun  swashbuckling adventure that  even with it  s flaws  captures your interest  it must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it  even if it  s made in the   s  it doesn  t have a modern feel  it more has the same feeling that a old errol flynn movie had  big adventure movie are again the big thing in hollywood but i  m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had  this on the other hand  just has the real feeling  you just can  t hate it  i think it  s an okay adventure movie  and i really love the soundtrack  damn  i want the theme song            the last hard men finds james coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang  do he and his friends head for the mexican border from jail and safety  no they don  t because coburn has a mission of revenge  to kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman  br    br   that peace officer is charlton heston who is now retired and he knows what coburn is after  as he explains it to his daughter  barbara hershey  coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a waco like standoff  his indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired  it  s not something he  s proud of  she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt  br    br   lest we feel sorry for coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is  heston is his usual stalwart hero  but the acting honors in the last hard men go to james coburn  he blows everyone else off the screen when he  s on   br    br   coburn gets the bright idea of making sure heston trails him by kidnapping hershey and taking her to an indian reservation where the white authorities can  t touch him  he knows that heston has to make it personal then  br    br   coburn  s gang includes  morgan paull  thalmus rasulala  john quade  larry wilcox  and jorge rivero  heston has chris mitchum along who is his son in law to be  br    br   the last hard men is one nasty and brutal western  andrew mclaglen directed it and i  m thinking it may have been a project originally intended for sam peckinpaugh  it sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence  of which there is a lot   br    br   for a little peckinpaugh lite  the last hard men is your film            maybe it was the title  or the trailer  certainly not the interview on the dvd  which is with the director as he keeps saying   hi  kids   into the camera like a buffoon   but i had expectations for entrails of a virgin to be at least a bit of sleazy fun with some good sex scenes and brutal  bloody killings by a weird japanese penetrator  turns out it  s way too sleazy for its own good  or bad  or whatever  there  s a problem  and one can see this also in the italian sexploitation flick porno holocaust  similar to this in many respects  in not having balance to the sex and violence  too much sex and it will turn into a prototypical porno  and not even with much production quality in comparison with most professional porno movies  and with the killing scenes  there has to be at least a little tack  and maybe just a smidgen of ingenuity  in creating the creature killer whatever  entrails of a virgin has neither  it  s safe to say it  s a pretty soulless movie  even if isn  t one of the very worst ever made  it  s there just for horn dog japanese fetishists to get off on girls in trouble and men who have all their brains in their   other   heads  br    br   in this case  we  re given a photo team where the guys are taking some shots of some girls  nothing too salacious  and then by way of a dense fog they stay off at some house one night and are picked off one by one by   a murderer   as he  s credited  first off  the director kazuo   gaira   komizu decides he has to put in a quota of random sex scenes early on  we get spliced in  or phoned in  take your pick  clips of one of the photographers having sex with one or more of the girls elsewhere  it looks like it  s from another movie  then once settled into the house  there  s a   wrestling   scene that  s poorly choreographed and shot  yeah  we really need to see him   all   there   and then on to the rape and killings  first the rape  by the photographers  who promise the girls some jobs for their time  then the murderer  who like d  amato  s creature is simply covered in mud and given a stupid facial  and who for an unknown reason kills the men and or rapes the women one by one  br    br   now  the latter of those  taken by themselves  should be considered the highlights of the movie  this is like saying  however  that the cro  tons are the best part of a wretchedly tasting salad  an eye gouging scene  a spike thrown like an olympic event  that scene  actually  is kind of cool   and finally the entrailing of the overly sex crazed girl  whose inconsequential name i can  t remember  even  this  becomes disappointing just by not being correct to the title  on top of this  the sex scenes  which become tedious through   gaira   and his indulgence in long takes without cutaways where everything by the japanese censors is blurred anyway  are dubbed over by the actors  you  d think that they seem to be enjoying themselves enough  hence the need to let them   speak   for themselves   but the overall feeling from entrails of a virgin is that of a lumpy one  where it  s just there to be gawked at and without a shred of suspense or true horror  watch as the last girl left alive  the virgin of the picture  tries to stop the murderer from getting to her  which lasts five minutes as she keeps throwing sticks at him   you just want it to be done with  for the   i hate women   mantra to ease up or be rid altogether            the few scenes that actually attempt a depiction of revolutionary struggle resemble a hirsute boy scout troop meandering tentatively between swimming holes  when sharif or  please god  palance try their hand at fiery oratory  they sound like kurtz swallowing a bug  the displays of strategic brilliance incorporate a map of cuba replete with smiling fishies in the ocean  and a positively vaudevillian hypothesis on how the bay of pigs came to pass  what does that leave us with  one comical dentistry scene  a surfeit of uppity hollywood peasants who address the camera as though it were a moving train  and  just for kicks  a passel of homoeroticism that is not limited to castro  s manic and unremitting cigar fellatio  never trust a medved  but even a busted clock is right twice a day  this is a historically awful movie            this film took me by surprise  i make it a habit of finding out as little as possible about films before attending because trailers and reviews provide spoiler after spoiler  all i knew upon entering the theater is that it was a documentary about a long married couple and that imdb readers gave it a      rotten tomatoes users ranked it at     and the critics averaged an amazing      if anything  they underrated this little gem  br    br   filmmaker doug block decided to record his parents   for posterity   and at the beginning of the film we are treated to the requisite interviews with his parents  outspoken mother mina  and less than forthcoming dad  mike  i immediately found this couple interesting and had no idea where the filmmaker  mike   mina  s son doug  was going to take us  as a matter of fact  i doubt that doug himself knew where he was going with this  br    br   life takes unexpected twists and turns and this beautifully expressive film follows the journey  it is difficult to verbalize just how moved i was with this story and the unique way in which it was told  absolutely riveting from beginning to end and it really is a must see even if you aren  t a fan of the documentary genre  this film will make you think of your own life and might even evoke memories that you thought were long forgotten       birch street   is one of those rare filmgoing experiences that makes a deep impression and never leaves you  the best news of all is that hbo had a hand in the production so instead of playing to a limited art house audience  eventually  millions of people will have a chance to view this incredible piece of work  bravo                   stephen hawkings is a genius  he is the king of geniuses  watching this movie makes me feel dumb  but it  s a great movie  not highly entertaining  but very very intriguing  the movie centers around wheelchair bound stephen hawkings  a man who makes einstein look average  and his theories and scientific discoveries about the universe  time  the galaxy  and black holes  everyone at sometime or another during a really intense high comes to a moment when they think they  v got the universe and the cosmos figured out and they swear as soon as they sober up they  ll write it all down  well here is a man who actually held that feeling for more then six hours  here is a man who despite suffering from lou gehrig  s disease has become the greatest mind the world has yet seen  watch this and listen in on how he has formulated theories on black holes  awesome  you won  t be the same after you see it            the story is about a psychic woman  tory  who returns to her hometown and begins reliving her traumatic childhood past  the death of her childhood friend and abusive father   tory discovers that her friend was just the first in a string of murders that are still occurring  can her psychic powers help solve the crimes and stop the continuing murders   br    br   you really don  t need to find out because  oh my god  this was so so so so bad  i know all the nora roberts fans will flock to this movie and give it tons of     s  then the rest of us will see an imdb score of   and actually think this movie is worth watching  but do not be fooled  the ending was predictable  the acting terrible  don  t even get me started about the southern accents  y  all   and the story was trite  just remember    you were warned            oh god  i must have seen this when i was only    or twelve   don  t ask how  i may have been young  but i wasn  t stupid  anyone could see that this is a bad movie  nasty  gross  unscary and very silly  i  ve seen more impressive effects at disneyland  i  ve seen better performances at a school play  and i  ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo  where they do nothing but sit in the water  ignoring the children tapping on the glass  br    br   the story is set in northern australia  a handful of ambitious young people  are trying out a new water sport  surfing in shark filled waters  it soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water  after they learn what  they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman  who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family  br    br   i think i have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years  the best of which is lake placid  and the worse of which is its sequel  blood surf would have to be the second worst croc flick i think  with primeval and crocodile tailing closely behind  br    br   the australian saltwater crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there  resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year  movies like blood surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature  but a good hour and a half of the viewer  s life  unless you really want to see it  avoid blood surf              fate   leads walter sparrow to come in possession of a mysterious novel that has eerie similarities and connections to his life  all based around the number     as the story unfolds in real life and fiction  sparrow must figure out his connection to the book and how the story will eventually end  br    br   the number    offers an intriguing premise that is undone by a weak execution  the film just failed on many different levels which is pretty disappointing because it held so much potential  the screenplay was probably the worst part about it  it was filled with silly sequences and laughable dialog that just killed the mood of the movie  it seemed like the screenwriter had a good idea  he just didn  t know how to develop it to stretch over a ninety minute running time  the second half of the film was running low on ideas  the twist was pretty obvious and the ending was awful  br    br   joel schumacher is responsible for one of the worst movies ever and he did redeem himself a little with phone booth and a few other films but the number    reminds me that he  s still capable of making a stinker  he has the movie drenched in style but he just can  t get a good focus  he moves the film at a clunky and slow pace  he switches from reality to what  s actually happening in the book which quickly got annoying  the actual book in the film that  s titled   the number      is an awful detective story and the audience gets stuck listening to carrey narrate it which just bored me to tears  when carrey is finally done with book  we get stuck watching him run around trying to solve the mystery  at this point  the audience has lost interest and there is no real tension  we impatiently wait for the movie to reach it  s horrible ending and unconvincing explanation before celebrating that film has finally finished  br    br   the acting was mostly average and pretty forgettable  jim carrey was clearly just sleepwalking through his performance and he didn  t even seem to be trying  he was either completely over the top in some scenes or just very wooden  his narration was a complete bore to listen to and he put no life inside his character  virginia madsen did the best she could with a limited role but she needs to pick better scripts  logan lerman was pretty bland as was danny huston  overall  the number    was an awful thriller that offered more laughs than suspense or thrills  rating                we brought this film as a joke for a friend  and could of been our worst joke to play  the film is barely watchable  and the acting is dire  the worst child actor ever used and hasslehoff giving a substandard performance  the plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on  it tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable  br    br   just terrible          this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life   it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous   and i have never seen such bad acting in my life  the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially drew fuller   i don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie   i didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves  i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn  i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch  i was very disappointed   the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion           this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds  i wouldn  t call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end  if you don  t want to know much about the plot  don  t keep reading  br    br   gilbert  s character  ophelia  is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident  gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she  otherwise a good actress  cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent  brad johnson  also an excellent actor  is matt  who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce  he is gentle  convincing and compelling in this role  br    br   the two meet on the beach through her daughter  pip  and initially  ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid  all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love  br    br   the chemistry between the two leads is not great  even though the talent of these two people is not  in my opinion  a question  they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical  two people meet  tragedy  bigger tragedy  a secret is revealed  another tragedy  and then they get together  i wish there was more to it than that  but there it is in a nutshell  br    br   i wanted mindless entertainment  and i got it with this  in regard to the genre of romantic films  this one fails to be memorable    a secret affair   with janine turner is far superior  not a steele book   as are some of steele  s earlier books turned into film           oh noes one of these attack of the japanese ghost girl movies    i don t even remember how many i ve seen  maybe it sells    but not to me  not scary at all  the japanese horror movies are have been very similar since the first one of these    also the pulling of the kid  i have seen that pulled under scene so many times in so many horror movies  cellphone scene is also nothing new    the dramaticness of the guy getting hit by a train kinda sucked    i mean it lacked all dramaticness    ok this is for kids       who listen to japanese rock and think they are so unique    we ll let me tell you  there s a million of you  d this is one of them       i ve seen worse but you won t be missing anything by not seeing this           nicholas walker is paul  the local town reverand who  s married to martha  ally sheedy   but also is a habitual womanizer and decides to fake his own death to run away with his current affair  veronica  dara tomanovich   however in so doing  he gets a bout of amnesia  hence the name of the film   sally kirkland is also on hand as a crazy old coot who pines for the good reverand in a shades of   misery   type of way  it  s sad to see a pretty good cast wasted like this  not the least bit john savage in a horridly forgettable role as a shoddy private investigator  in a film billed as a   black comedy    one has to bring both elements into said movie  while this does bring the former in spades  it sadly contains none of the latter  furthermore you can  t emphasize with any of the characters and as thus  have absolutely no vested interest in them  technically not an all together bad movie just an extremely forgettable one  br    br   eye candy  dara tomanovich gets topless  sally kirkland also shows some skin  br    br   my grade  c   br    br   where i saw it  showtime showcase           hollywood movie industry is the laziest one in the entire world  it only needs a single hit to flood theaters with the same old crap re invented over and over again  take superheroes for example  for each x man and spiderman  there are daredevil  elektra  ghost rider and hulk  japanese horror remakes are even worst  it only took the ring  which was pitch perfect  mostly because of mr  gore verbinsky   to bring a ton of look alike creepy woman based horrors  e g  the ring    the eye  dark water  which was fine  but pointless   and the grudges  br    br   the first grudge wasn  t entirely bad  it was scary most of the way  which is what one could expect from it  plus  the plot had some brains mixing narratives  grudge   is exactly like the previous  this could be a good thing  but hey  what boy men in black ii  was it a nice thing to xerox the entire screenplay and just change the villain  for the grudge    the critic goes the same way  br    br   tired scares  bad acting  except for amber tamblyn   and clich  s all over the place  three stories take place  on different places and time  there is aubrey  tamblyn  investigating what drove her sister karen  sarah michelle gellar  to death  allison  arielle kebbel  who is taken by colleagues to visit the house where the incident depicted in the first movie took place  and finally  an american family that witness strange stuff happening on the apartment next door  glad to say  and i mean it  that everything is tied up at the end  but one must not rely on the end to make a good picture  when everything else is simply tiresome and dull  br    br   the chills are all over there  a girl alone in the lockers  someone who shouldn  t enter a house  others that dig too deep  meanwhile  ghosts keep killing and killing and killing  which seems even more deadlier than ten world wars or the ebola epidemic  hey  doesn  t that seem just like another bad japanese remake  something called pulse  yeah  day after day it  s getting easier to hold a grudge    against hollywood bullshits              down periscope   has been in our library since it first arrived in vhs  since then  we have acquired the dvd and a digital from cinema now  br    br   it is a quirky flick that does not go militarily overboard as either pro or con  it is first and foremost a comedy and as a vehicle for the main characters  i am quite surprised that a sequel has never been offered  br    br   the movie has gained a following that borders on a cult obsession  even among the very young  i became aware of this while visiting the uss drum in mobile  alabama in       a group of cub scouts  my grandson among them  had all taken up the roles from the movie and planned to relive it during their overnighter on board  br    br   it is a fun romp that makes you proud both of our navy and hollywood    which is rare company  br    br   thanks to kelsey grammar  lauren holly and rob schneider for making what could have been an otherwise unremarkable movie  such great entertainment            if you came here  it  s because you  ve already seen this film and were curious what others had to say about it  br    br   i feel for you  i  really  do  and i profusely apologize as a canadian  because that  s what we do  that this film ever had to cross your eyes  if only for a moment  i hear there is no cure for the retinal bleeding reported out of every dozen cases  br    br   i  like everyone else  rented this movie believing it to be some stupid b movie ripoff of blade  i thought    sure i could use a good laugh at a stupid movie    i  ll give the creators of this film one positive comment about their   creation    thanks for removing the rec xx xx xx from the bottom right hand corner of the screen  i can see how that would have been a distraction from seeing this movie  br    br   and for the record  i  saw  the movie  but did not watch it  the dialogue was incoherent and most of the scenes took place in my grandmother  s trailer  i swear to god  br    br   you know what  i  m not writing anymore about this  it  s just too painful            deanna durbin  nan grey and barbara read are   three smart girls   in this universal film from       which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences  it also stars ray milland  mischa auer  charles winninger  john king  binnie barnes and alice brady  it  s a sweet story about three young women  now living in switzerland with their divorced mother  who hear their father  winninger  is marrying again  not having seen him in    years and knowing their mother still loves him  they board a ship to america  with the help of the housekeeper nanny  determined to stop the wedding  realizing that the intended  called   precious    barnes  is nothing but a gold digger aided and abetted by her mother  brady   they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count  this is arranged by their father  s accountant  king   the man he chooses is a full time drunk  auer   but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count  milland   what a mess  br    br   this is a delightful film  not cloying or overly sugary at all  with some nice performances  particularly by auer  milland  barnes and brady  the young women are pretty and all do good work  the emphasis  of course  is on young durbin  who is a natural actress and a beautifully trained singer  in fact  her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult   she has no trouble with the high notes  as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice  she sings a delightful   il bacio   in a police station  br    br   one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father  played by charles winninger  not want his children around   until he sees them and gets to know them  barnes as the gold digger isn  t all that young  but the girls   mother looks way up there  so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger  more glamorous woman  in fact  he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters  br    br   universal gives durbin the big star buildup here   she has the final shot in the movie  ray milland at this point was still paying his dues  and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is  br    br   very entertaining and of course  this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna            if anyone is wondering why no one makes movies like they used to  with conversation  character and a simple theme of friendship struggling to evolve into something new  better and different  those folks need to take in this film and see top notch writing  directing  and acting that melds into a wonderful evening of observation on how things used to be in italy and england  other days  other times funneled into a terrific comedy of entertainment  made in      with alfred molina  joan plowright  polly walker  josie lawrence  jim broadbent  miranda richardson  and michael kitchens in the major roles  under the brush stroke direction of mike newell  these actors accomplish vividly memorable performances that are photographed with a sublimely subtle painter  s eye  reminiscent of the theatrical bedroom farce of the turn of the century  this film might be called a friendship farce that becomes a worthwhile experience in the growth of the romantic nature within each character  and the viewer  too  an artistic telegram on the importance of caring about those around us            i watched this series out of curiosity wanting to see if they could possibly and with all this modern technology out do cecil b  demille  s classic epic of       starring charleton heston yul brenner and sir cedric hardwicke  of course  i was let down  yes  they had all the biblical characters correct  but they didn  t give us any of the spectacular theatrical scenes  that held your interest throughout the first movie  if you going to have a mini series  you have to have some   rivoting   scenes  the   burning bush    parting the   red sea   drowning   pharohs armies      building sethi  s pyramids    could have been done with todays   technology on the scale of blockbuster movies such as   lord of the rings   or the matrix  obviously  they didn  t want to leave a lasting impression of   faith and sacrifice    which is much needed in these trouble times            daniel day lewis is the most versatile actor alive  english aristocratic snob in a room with a view  passionate irish thief in in the name of the father  an impudent  violent butcher in gangs of new york  in a performance ten times stronger than adrian brody  s in the pianist  and as the outrageous cristy brown with cerebral palsy in my left foot  just to name a few   his roles all influence eachother  but each is seperate  and utterly unique  he changes completely  with each character he takes on  and i  m beginning to believe that he can act as anything  anything  br    br   as cristy brown he is stunning  he does not ridicule the character  and he does not pity the character  a difficult achievement  and cristy brown comes to life  a smart man  an outrageous man  human  br    br   this movie  despite small scene transition faults and the like  is an inspiration  yes  it  s predictable  but is it stupidly sentimental  no  i laughed  i cried  not a single moment of cheese  proof that this isn  t a hollywood movie  br    br   my favourite scene is the scene in the restaurant  when cristy is discussing painters with eileen  peter and her friends  here  s where daniel day lewis reaches an acting climax    i  ll kick you in the only part of your anatomy that  s animated      wheel out the cripple    and his performance never slows down  never falters  and is beautiful  simply  he has a lot of screen time here  i watch it again again  and i never get tired of cristy  s perspicacious eyes  twitching and guttural speeches  br    br   a must see  fo sho  yo            my guess would be this was originally going to be at least two parts  and thus at least a quarter longer  because otherwise how can one explain its confused  abbreviated storyline  i was never completely lost  but i was often partially lost and usually unclear on character motivation  the movie feels as though joining plot points were dropped to squeeze it into its time slot  br    br   if it were longer  it might make more sense  but it still wouldn  t be much good  the movie  s most interesting idea is of the war between zeus and hera as being a war between the male and female  but the movie drops the ball on this  making hera  s followers fairly horrible while not being clear on what zeus   followers do or believe  the movie is also interesting because you don  t see the gods and there  s no real certainty that they exist  so it  s got a couple of intriguing ideas  but it doesn  t do anything useful with them  br    br   bad dialog  cardboard characters  and one interesting scene involving hercules and his three antagonistic sons  not unwatchable but also not worth watching            well  i like to watch bad horror b movies  cause i think it  s interesting to see stupidity and unability of creators to shoot seriously good movie   i always compare this movies to   for example   some spielberg  s works and again and again don  t understand the huge difference in what i see   i like ed wood  s movies cause it  s so inept it  s very funny  but people      the chilling   is not funny and is not even   interesting    it  s extremely boring horror movie without anything what makes even bad movies watchable  there  s no acting  no screenplay  no direction  no thrills and not even blood  it  s extremely inept amateurish film  it  s definitely the worst movie i had ever seen  and i had seen a lot of   worst movies     believe me   i warned you                    this is the worst movie i have ever seen  as well as  the worst that i will probably ever see  i see no need to rehash what all the others have said previously  just be forewarned    br    br   this is not one of those bad movies you think you want to watch because you want to be able to make fun of it  its just plain bad bad bad bad bad  br    br   this movie is the equivalent to having a   pet rock   as your friend  you wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait for something to happen  unfortunately  it never does  at least with a pet rock you knew what you were getting into  lion  s gate completely deceives on this bombshell    no   this is a disaster  after watching this film  you would swear george w  bush had his hands all over the making of this film    yes its that idiotic  br    br   stay away  unless of course you just want to watch the worst movie of all time  its probably how lion  s gate figured it would make some money off this piece of tripe            i have been a mario fan for as long as i can remember  i have very fond memories of playing super mario world as a kid  this game has brought back many of those memories while adding something new  super mario galaxy is the latest installment in the amazing mario franchise  there is much very different about this game from any other mario before it  while still keeping intact the greatest elements of mario  the first noticeable difference is that the story takes place in space  br    br   the story begins much like any other mario game  mario receives a letter from princess peach inviting him to a celebration at her castle in the mushroom kingdom  upon arriving at peach  s castle mario finds bowser and his son  bowser jr   attacking the castle with their airships  bowser kidnaps princess peach and then lifts her castle up into space  in the midst of the castle being lifted into space mario falls off and lands on an unknown planet  mario is found by a talking star named luma and is taken back to the luma  s home  a floating space station  here mario meets many other lumas and also meets their leader  a woman named rosalina  rosalina tells mario that bowser has taken away the space station  s power stars and scattered them across the universe  it is up to mario to help the lumas find them and save peach  thus the adventure begins  br    br   the way you play the game is by flying from the space station to other galaxies  each galaxy consists of multiple planets that mario travels amongst in levels via these shooting stars to retrieve the power stars  mario can at many times walk all the way around planets without losing gravity  some planets are small and others are big  many planets are similar to classic mario environments  the best thing about the game are the controls  all of the stuff like jumping and such is still the same  but the wiimote is used in many unique ways in this game  you shake the remote mario will perform a spin that is used as the primary attack in the game  and it will as well activate the shooting stars  you can also point the remote at the screen and use the pointer to fire star bits at enemies or objects in the environment  then there is the graphics  these are by far the best graphics on the wii  it is just so hard to describe how great this game looks  you could probably almost say it looks as good as some     games  br    br   my only minor gripes is that the going upside down effect takes some getting used to  and also the story is pretty weak  the worst part is that you lose all of your lives when you turn off the game  no matter how many you had when you last quit you restart at   lives  still these minor problems aside it  s a superb game that is highly entertaining and is very challenging  this is the type of game that we  ve been waiting for on the wii  br    br   a perfect    out of                this short film that inspired the soon to be full length feature   spatula madness   is a hilarious piece that contends against similar cartoons yielding multiple writers  the short film stars edward the spatula who after being fired from his job  joins in the fight against the evil spoons  this premise allows for some funny content near the beginning  but is barely present for the remainder of the feature  this film  s    minute running time is absorbed by some odd ball comedy and a small musical number  unfortunately not much else lies below it  the plot that is set up doesn  t really have time to show  but it  s surely follows it plot better than many high budget hollywood films  this film is worth watching at least a few times  take it for what it is  and don  t expect a deep story             okay  last night  august   th        i had the distinct displeasure of meeting mr  van bebble at a showing of the film the manson family at the three penny in chicago as part of the chicago underground film festival  here  s what i have to say about it  first of all  the film is an obvious rip off of every kenneth anger  roman polanski  oliver stone and terry gilliam movie i  ve ever seen  second of all  in a short q   a session after the show mr  van bebble immediately stated that he never made any contact with the actual manson family members or charlie himself  calling them liars and saying he wanted nothing to do with them  that the film was based on his  van bebble  s  take on the trial having seen it all from his living room on tv and in the news  and i  m assuming from the autobiography and the book helter skelter which were directly mimicked through the narrative   so i had second dibs on questions  i asked if he was trying to present the outsider  mtv  sex drugs and rock   n roll version and not necessarily the true story  this question obviously pissed off the by now sloshed director who started shouting   f    you  shut the f    up  this is the truth  all those other movies are bullsh      br    br   well anyway  i didn  t even think about how ridiculous this was until the next day when i read the tagline for the film    you  ve heard the laws side of the story   now hear the story as it is told by the manson family    excuse me  if this guy has never even spoken to the family and considers them to be liars that he doesn  t want to have anything to do with  how in god  s name can he tell the story for them   this is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard  the film was obviously catered to the sex drugs and rock   n roll audience that it had no trouble in attracting to the small  dimly lit theatre  and was even more obviously spawned by the sex drugs and rock   n roll mind of a man who couldn  t even watch his own film without getting up every ten minutes to go get more beer or to shout some sort of rocky horroresque call line to the actors on screen  this film accomplishes little more than warping the public  s image of actual events  which helped shape the state of america and much of the world today  into some sort of slasher comic book porno rape fantasy dreamed up by an obviously shallow individual  br    br   the film was definitely very impressive to look at  the soundtrack was refreshing as it contained actual samples of charlie  s work with the family off of his lie album  the editing was nice and choppy to simulate the nauseating uncertainty of most modern music videos  all in all this film would have made a much better addition to the catalogues at mtv than to the underground film festival or for that matter the minds of any intellectual observers  i felt like i was at a midnight rocky horror viewing the way the audience was dressed and behaving  probably the best part of the experience   the cast was very good with the exception of charlie who resembled some sort of stoned dungeons and dragons enthusiast more than the actual role he was portraying  the descriptions the film gave of him as full of energy  throwing ten things at you and being very physical about it all the while did not match at all the slow  lethargic  and chubby representation that was actually presented  br    br   all in all the film basically explains itself as sadie  or maybe it was linda  declares at the end    you can write a bunch of bullsh   books or make a bunch of bullsh   movies   etc  etc    case in point  even the disclaimer   based on a true story   is a dead giveaway  signalling that somewhere beneath this psychedelic garbage heap lay the foundation of an actual story with content that will make and has made a difference in the world  all you have to do is a little bit of alchemy to separate the truth from the the crap  or actually  maybe you could just avoid it all together and go read a book instead  br    br   all i can say is this  when the film ended i got a free beer so i  m glad i went  but not so glad i spent fifteen dollars on my ticket to be told to shut the f    up for asking the director a question  peace             i bought this game on an impulse buy from walmart  i am glad i did  it was very entertaining listening to sean connery and playing the game  i thought the graphics were the best i have ever seen in a movie game remake  the bonus levels were very hard  the sniper one i think was too hard  it made me so frustrated i didn  t play the game for a week and a half  there were too many people shooting at you with nothing to hide behind or life to handle it   br    br   the only thing i might change was the upgrade system  i didn  t notice any difference from un upgraded equipment to the upgraded  such as buying an armor upgrade didn  t seem to make the armor stronger or more filling on my life meter  i really liked the q copter  i think the developers did a good job             no  this hilariously horrible     s made for tv horror clinker isn  t about a deadly demonically possessed dessert cake  still  this exceptionally awful  yet undeniably amusing and thus enjoyable cathode ray refuse reaches a breathtaking apex of absolute  unremitting silliness and atrociousness that  s quite tasty in a so execrable it  s downright awesome sort of way  richard crenna  looking haggard and possibly inebriated  and yvette mimieux  who acts as if she never got over the brutal rape she endured in   jackson county jail    sluggishly portray a disgustingly nice and respectable suburbanite couple whose quaint  dull  sleepy small town existence gets ripped asunder when the cute german shepard they take in as the family pet turns out to be some ancient lethal evil spirit  pretty soon mimieux and her two repellently cutesy kids kim richards and ike eisenmann  the psychic alien moppets from the disney   witch mountain   pictures  are worshiping a crude crayon drawing of the nasty  ugly canine entity in the den  boy  now doesn  t that sound really scary and disturbing  well  scary and disturbing this laughably ludicrous claptrap sure ain  t  but it sure is funny  thanks to curtis    night tide    harrington  s hopelessly weak direction  cartoonish  not so  special effects  an almost painfully risible  n  ridiculous plot  and a game cast that struggles valiantly with the absurd story  besides the leads  both martine beswicke and r g  armstrong briefly pop up as members of a satanic cult and victor jory has a nice cameo as a helpful native american shaman   favorite scene  the malicious mephestophelion mutt puts the whammy on crenna  practically forcing him to stick his hand into a wildly spinning lawnmower blade  while stuck up snobby fright film fans may hold their noses at the perfectly putrid stench of this admittedly smelly schlock  devout tv trash lovers should deem this endearingly abominable offal the boob tube equivalent to alpo             it is easy to tell early in this movie exactly what will happen  and who will die  it is about   women and a man who on a vacation  this was made during the end of the ultra nazi seventies  when blonde women were supposedly ultra american survivors and brunettes were all deserving of death  br    br   this movie  like the others of that era  contrives to bring this about  and the viewer knows this  there is no mystery or suspense  the people squabble  but everything is so predictable for the prejudices of the time  it is laughable  br    br   the five people happen upon two savage young characters  and go nuts  everyone is nuts  so that the director writer team can justify their nazi propaganda  br    br   for some reason  the guy is attracted to the blonde  who is really not much to look at  and ignores a super hot looking brunette that any heterosexual man would go nuts over  one must remember that in the seventies  movies were meant to appeal to women and not men  br    br   totally crap and totally depressing             marion davies stars in this remarkable comedy   show people   released by mgm in       davies plays a hick from savannah  georgia  who arrives in hollywood with her father  dell henderson   the jalopy they arrive in is a hoot   as is davies outrageous southern costume  davies lands a job in slapstick comedy  not what she wants  but it brings her success  she meets fellow slapstick star william haines  who is immediately smitten with her  well  davies then gets a job at a more prestigious studio    high art studios    and lands a job in stuffy period pieces  a handsome but fake actor  andre telefair  shows her the ropes of how to be the typical pretentious hollywood star  davies abandons her slapstick friend and father for the good life  but of course learns that is not who she really is  marion davies is wonderful throughout  as she   outrageously   runs the gamut of emotions required of a   serious   actress  william haines is his usual wonderful comedic self  and there are cameos by charles chaplin  john gilbert  and other famous stars of the day  including the director of the film  king vidor  this is a silent film with a few   sound effects   as sound pictures were just coming into their own  a treasure of a film             the performance of every actor and actress  in the film  are excellently natural which is what movie acting should be  and the directing skill is so brilliantly handled on every details that i am never tired of seeing it over and over again  however  i am rather surprised to see that this film is not included in some of the actors   and director  attenborough  s credits that puzzles me  aren  t they proud of making a claim that they have made such excellent  long lasting film for the audience  i am hoping i would get some answers to my puzzles from some one  possibly one of the   knowledgeable   personnel  insider  of the film             while star trek the motion picture was mostly boring  star trek the final frontier is plain bad  in this terrible sequel  the crew is on shore leave when they get a distress signal from the federation that ambassadors representing earth  romulus and kronos  the klingon home world  have been kidnapped by a renegade vulcan bent on his quest to attain a starship to venture into the great barrier  there  he hopes to find god  using mysticism and bad writing  he persuades many of the senior officers of the enterprise to betray kirk and get a hold of the ship  they do reach the inside of the great barrier and find a planet where they do meet a god like alien  this one is so bad it is hard to figure out where to begin  at the core is a good idea that is never really developed  the plot goes nowhere instead of where no man has gone before  it is almost like the writers had no idea how to end this fiasco  the action scenes don  t have the suspense of wrath of kahn  the philosophy is boring  and the humor is stale  now i will focus most of my anger on william shatner  when he takes the director  s chair  the ego gets bigger  most of the focus is on him  spock  and mccoy  but does not give the others enough to do  moreover  whereas shatner is usually guilty of over acting in previous movies and television spots  he is just plain bad in this one  now kirk is reckless  a practical jokers  and silly  one of the worst scenes involves the three leaders singing the song    row row row your boat   in a round by a campfire  in any case  this is the worst of the star trek franchise  i should have given it three out of ten instead of five             despite later claims  this early talkie melodrama has very little in common with   citizen kane    it  s a biopic of a ruthless but human fictional plutocrat  told in flashback but hopping around time  the scriptwriter  preston sturges  shows none of his later gift for sparkling dialog  and none of the myriad cinematic innovations of   kane   are evident  still  it  s very watchable  with a young spencer tracy  his old man makeup makes him look just like  well  an old spencer tracy  showing depth and authority  and colleen moore    a little past her prime  and not physically well matched    playing a multifaceted woman behind the man  there  s also helen vinson as one of the most treacherous femmes fatales in movie history  sending the final third into ecstatic soap opera reverberations  the surviving print is jumpy and has missing audio snippets  and there are some plot holes left open  how would she know whose son it was if she  s sleeping with both of them    and the music is awfully hokey  for all that  i was quite fascinated             this is the best version  so far  that you will see and the most true to the bronte work  dalton is a little tough to imagine as rochester who jane eyre declared   not handsome    but his acting overcomes this and zelah clark  pretty as she is  is also a complete and believable jane eyre  this production is a lengthy watch but well worth it  nearly direct quotes from the book are in the script and if you want the very first true   romance   in literature  this is the way to see it  i own every copy of this movie and have read and re read the original  the filming may seem a little dated now but there will never be another like this             apparently  the people that wrote the back of the box did not bother to watch this so called   movie    they described   blindingly choreographed intrigue and violence    i saw no   intrigue    i instead saw a miserable attempt at dialogue in a supposed kung fu movie  i saw no   violence    at least  i saw nothing which could cause me to suspend my disbelief as to what could possibly hurt a man with   impervious   skin  but here i am perhaps revealing too much of the   plot    furthermore  as a viewer of many and sundry films  some of which include the occasional kung fu movie   i can authoritatively say that this piece of celluloid is unwatchable  whatever you may choose to do  i will always remain br    br    correct  br    br    jonathan tanner  br    br     br    br   p s  i was not blinded by the choreography             i liked boyle  s performance  but that  s about the only positive thing i can say  everything was overdone to the point of absurdity  most of the actors spoke like you would expect your   year old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded  stone hearted cop  or an ultra evil villain  the raspy voice overs seemed amateurish to me  i could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music  and what  s with the whole     ish police torture stuff  it was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story  cox added a lot of things  in fact  that he apparently thought would be really cool  but had nothing to do with the story  that  s a big disappointment because one of the things that makes borges   stories so good is his minimalism    they are tightly bound  with no superfluous details  this movie is just the opposite  i stopped watching after the scene where lonnrot is questioning the guy from the yidische zaitung  or thereabouts  i wasted    renting this  but at least i can get some satisfaction from writing this review and hopefully saving others from making the same mistake            it s terrific when a funny movie doesn t make smile you  what a pity   this film is very boring and so long  it s simply painfull  the story is staggering without goal and no fun  br    br   you feel better when it s finished            so well made  no cgi crap  has anyone else been on the   jumping crocs   tour of darwin  s adelaide river before  black water was way realistic  rogue was a bit cringeworthy  br    br   thought the blonde chick was excellent in it   haven  t really seen her before  and the other chick is a babe  she is always excellent   br    br   v  suspenseful   i would compare it to jaws over any other man eating animal flick   br    br   got the hole aussie thing down pat without going ott with struths and crikeys  as well   br    br   loved it             the assignment is an outstanding thriller with several plot twists driven by character  rather than star turns  the need to stage special effects  obligatory romance  and endless car chases  however  there is a car chase in here  and a dandy it is  aidan quinn is wonderful as both the terrorist and the naval officer   recruited   to eliminate him  it is rare that a second or third tier actor  such as quinn  is given an important starring role like this that carries a film  usually  such a role is given to an a list actor with box office draw  which is probably why i never heard of this film before i saw it  donald sutherland is great as the morally ambiguous  somewhat creepy at times  agent that recruits quinn  ben kingsley is fine also as the israeli agent  the plot is very complex and there are multiple story lines  which converge in gradual fashion toward the end  and not all at once as we  re used to seeing  the paranoia and claustrophobia of these type of thrillers is captured and portrayed with both moral ambiguity and frightening intensity  the locations are convincing and effective  the soundtrack is nothing special  but rarely do we get all of the above mentioned qualities these days  without dumb and or meaningless plot developments  unconvincing star turns  loud  annoying  music video type soundtracks  a villain that hams it up  and repeatedly a cast  costumes  and plot that cater mostly to an audience under     this is an outstanding thriller  which most assuredly did not get its just due upon its release         of   stars             this is one of the finest movies i have ever seen    the stark scenery   the isolation   the ignorant bigoted people hiding behind their religion   a backdrop for some wordliness and sophistication   the acting is completely natural   but for me as a  foodie   the best is the actual choosing and preparation of the feast  i have spent time in paris and know the cuisine well   whether or not the cafe anglais really exists i don  t know but i do know of similar establishments and babette  s menu and choice of wines are authentic   and of course the end where despite themselves the perfect meal mellows them back to friendship is the only ending there could be  this is a    out of    film and should be seen by anyone with enough brain and taste to understand it            set in the       the second year of the french republic formed after the execution of louis xvi  this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders danton  gerard depardieu  at his finest  and robespierre  a commanding performance by the polish actor wojciech pszoniak   the moderate revolutionary danton has returned to paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the committee of public safety in the previous year by robespierre  he is opposed to   the reign of terror   which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens  mainly by guillotine  who are thought to be opposed to the revolution  danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade robespierre to curb the bloodletting  but robespierre and the committee are afraid that the popularity of danton will lead to them being overthrown  and put danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors  this was the first french language film made by andrzej wajda after he had arrived in france from poland  his polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the solidarity trade union  which had opposed the polish government in the late seventies and early eighties  his previous film   man of iron          had dealt with the solidarity union and its leader lech walesa  and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of walesa and the polish leader general jaruselski  and that between danton and robespierre  danton walesa are the voice of reason opposed to robespierre jaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent  the film is based on the polish play   the danton affair   written by stanislawa przybyszewska in the     s  and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical  but what the film does is to concentrate on the behind the scenes meetings of the committees and the scenes in the national assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of paris             usually i  m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties   early nineties film featuring now has beens   but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through  guys dressing up as girls has been done to death   but never so pathetically  corey haim  s performance was abysmal as usual  nicole eggert was not much better  this has no redeeming qualities  even if you are a number    fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash   stay away             i have now seen quite a few films by pedro almod  var  but this would have to be the most disappointing so far  this film seemed to lack the zaniness that is usually everywhere in his films  and the story just never got me interested  many almod  var regulars appear in this film  so it  s not like there was a lack of on screen talent  but this film just seemed more serious than his other films  if there was a comedic edge to this movie  i certainly couldn  t find it  and it made for one surprisingly weak movie             i greatly enjoyed margaret atwood  s novel   the robber bride    and i was thrilled to see there was a movie version  a woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder  and his buddy  an ex cop journalist  tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman  s crazy female friends  it  s fortunate that the movie script fixes ms  atwood  s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men  victims of scheming women    br    br   heh  okay  you got me  if these guys are mentioned in the book  and i  m pretty sure they  re entirely made up for the movie  i  ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy  apparently  the three main female characters of the novel aren  t enough to carry the movie  zenia  s manipulations aren  t interesting unless we see them happen to a man  and a man  s life is screwed up  roz  charis  and toni tell their stories    to a man  because it  s not important if a man doesn  t hear them  br    br   i liked the characters in the book  it hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man  s story  i normally do not look for feminist angles on media  and i tried to enjoy the movie as is  if i hadn  t read the book  i might have enjoyed the movie a lot more  so if you like the cop and the ex cop  and you want to read more about them  you  re out of luck  read the novel  if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot  it  s the same plot  the movie excavated it  ironed it  and sprinkled it with male angst  it  s like zenia  s revenge on margaret atwood            this movie gets a    because there is a lot of gore in it who cares about the plot or the acting this is an italian horror movie people so you know you can t expect much from the acting or the plot everybody knows fulci took footage from other movies and added it to this one since i never seen any of the movies that he took footage from it didn t matter to me the italian godfather of gore out done himself with this movie this is one of the goriest italian movies you will ever see no gore hound should be without this movie in their horror movie collection buy this movie no matter what it is a horehounds dream come true            ingrid bergman  playing dentist walter matthau  s faithful receptionist who harbors a little crush on her boss  is absolutely wonderful in this film  she handles the witty repartee in the script with aplomb and steals a terrific scene where she and goldie hawn talk in a record booth  ingrid  s monologue is a front  but her face tells you she believes in it with all her heart   matthau is an odd choice for the leading man  he  s too old for goldie hawn and too unrefined for bergman  not to mention too unfocused to be a dentist   but i liked the way he tries hard to please goldie and stumbles around trying to free himself from a lie  hawn  who won a supporting oscar  is just as fresh and bubbly as she is today  this bedroom farce isn  t terribly sophisticated  and faintly reminds one of   any wednesday   besides   but it  s a welcome relief from the noisy  teen oriented comedies they turn out today    cactus flower   is a lovely sigh      from                   a bored television director is introduced to the black arts and astral projection by his girlfriend  learning the ability to separate his spirit from his body  the man finds a renewed interest in his life and a sense of wellbeing  unfortunately  the man discovers while he is sleeping  his spirit leaves his body and his uncontrolled body roams the streets in a murderous rampage    according to the dvd sleeve  s synopsis  br    br   the synopsis isn  t entirely correct  as it turns out  br    br   anyway  the movie opens with a dizzying   out of body   example of handsome director winston rekert  as paul sharpe   s newly discovered   astral body   experience  it also foreshadows an upcoming dogfight  young andrew bednarski  as matthew sharpe   being a kid  draws pictures of   the blue man    as his murder spree begins  handsome detective john novak  as stewart kaufman  discovers the victims are connected to mr  rekert  mr  novak  s investigation leads to the supernatural  a prime example of which is karen black  as janus   with whom rekert fears he is falling in love  br    br   several in the cast perform well  but    the blue man   winds up tying itself up in a knot  aka   eternal evil    its unsatisfying story tries to be far too clever for its own good             ah yes the     s   a time of reaganomics and sly   chuck and a host of other action stars hiding in a remote jungle blowing away commies   at the time i couldn t believe how movies like rambo   missing in action and uncommon valor   and who can forget the ridiculous red dawn     made money at the box office   they re turgid action crap fests with a rather off putting right wing agenda and they have dated very badly   troma s war is a tongue in cheek take on these type of movies but you ve got to ask yourself did they need spoofing in the first place   of course not   troma s war lacks any sort of sophistication   though it does make the point that there s no real difference between right wing tyrants and left wing ones   and sometimes feels more like a grade z movie than a send up   maybe it is              this tale based on two edgar allen poe pieces    the fall of the house of usher      dance of death    poem    is actually quite creepy from beginning to end  it is similar to some of the old black and white movies about people that meet in an old decrepit house  for example    the cat and the canary      the old dark house      night of terror   and so on   boris karloff plays a demented inventor of life size dolls that terrorize the guests  he dies early in the film  or does he     and the residents of the house are subjected to a number of terrifying experiences  i won  t go into too much detail here  but it is definitely a must see for fans of old dark house mysteries  br    br   watch it with plenty of popcorn and soda in a darkened room  br    br   dan basinger                 i am so happy and surprised that there is so much interest in this movie  jack frost was my introduction into the films produced and distributed by a pix entertainment  and without exception  everything this company deals with is pure crap  first  and this is very important  never ever watch this movie sober  why would you  unlike many other entertaingly bad movies  this one i feel was made intentionally bad  i just can  t get over how fake the snowman is  which is why its always shown only briefly  the way it moves is the best  this movie is waaaaaaaaaaay better than the michael keaton piece of crap  becuz that was made too be a good movie  and that version is as bad as this               revolt of the zombies   proves that having the same director revamp and recycle an idea doesn  t necessarily make lightning strike twice  br    br   the halperin brothers  responsible for the horror classic   white zombie    made this trite piece of garbage a mere few years later to cash in on its popularity and even recycled close ups of lugosi  s eyes from that previous film  there was a court battle with the   white zombie   film  s rights owners  who didn  t want the halperins to be able to use the word   zombie   in this title  that word was the only thing that could help this film  because  as everyone knows  bad films can make much more money simply by having the word   zombie   appear in the title  knowing what victor halperin was capable of a few years before only makes this uninteresting film more insulting  it seems he never directed another horror film after this debacle  the zombies here seem not to be true walking dead  but simply hypnotism victims  br    br   wanna create a mind controlled army of zombies  be ready to crack a few eggs  including your own  br    br   the lame plot  man falls in love with scheming woman who plays with his heart and becomes engaged to him only to make his friend  whom she loves  jealous  this sends man into a spiral of madness in which he tries using zombie mind control techniques to change things to his advantage in an attempt to win over a woman who isn  t worth spit  br    br   this includes one of the most blatantly obvious plot developments i  ve ever seen  you  d have to be blind or stupid not to see the ending coming  the acting isn  t even good  this movie makes the racially insensitive   king of the zombies    which appeared on the same double bill dvd i bought  seems like an atmospheric horror masterpiece by comparison and reminds us that not every black and white film is a classic  it makes the atomic age sci fi alien zombie cheese fest   invisible invaders   seem like a serious drama  this is one big ball of cheese so ridiculously melodramatic it could probably make many a korean film fan twitch  south korean films are often known for their use of melodrama   the credits list the ironically named company favorite films  i  m not sure whose favorite film this would be  but they  re obviously an idiot  br    br   not recommended for fans of  zombies  romance  or classic films             the complaints are valid  to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women  i am okay with these night time soaps  like grey  s anatomy  or ugly betty  or west wing  because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end  however  when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men  taye diggs  tim daly  and chris lowell  into sexual tension and romps  and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so called little hospital  it seems like general hospital   or a female counterpart to baywatch  that was what men wanted and they had it  so if this is what women want so be it  but the idea that this is a high brow show  or something men will watch  is unrealistic             this movie was one of the best movies that i have seen this year  i didn  t see any cameos in the movie  but it is still pretty good  it is similar to anchorman in the humor department  but i think this is a better put together movie  it actually has a point  if you are going to see a whole bunch of t a you will be disappointed  just a well put together movie     if you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor  you will find this to be a really good movie  i definitely think that ebert and roeper  s review of this movie is right on  i mean  i don  t really like ebert on most movies  but this is the movie that i will agree about  the movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there  there is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie  yea  sure  you get laughed at when it is found out about  but it still suggests that you wait  steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet  it is still funny             i remember seeing this film in the mid     s thought it a well paced and well acted piece  i now work quite often in berkeley square and the had to get a copy of dvd to remind myself how little the area has changed  although my office is newish it just    seconds away from   the bank    even jack barclays car dealership is still there selling bentleys and rolls royces  br    br   it  s look like the dvd is due a region   release soon  the region   copy i is very poor quality  let  s hope they  ve cleaned it up  br    br   only the slightly dodgy escape sequence from the court spoils what would otherwise be a great film but i guess is in line with the caper tag the film goes with             two hours ago i was watching this brilliant movie which overwhelmed me with its imprisoning photography  it is quite understandable how it won the prize of best camera in cannes       close ups predominated it  close ups of walls  humans and of many other things  the warm colored lighting  which is also usually by the director  gave the movie a warm atmosphere  only two persons are principally to be seen in most of it  an interesting music and especially three songs or themes accompanied the movie nearly all the time  each one of these themes represented a certain atmosphere during the whole movie  silence and slow movements characterize the movie  some scenes were extended moments or a serious of close ups  not only tony leung deserves a prize for his superb acting since maggie cheung was also so brilliant  i wonder how many dresses she was wearing in the different scenes  the story was also connected somehow with the history of hong kong and the region the     s  this prevented me from understanding some details of the it especially at the end  in short i would recommend the fans of artistic movies to watch it in the cinema             luckily for bill murray this is such a light weight project since he pretty much has to carry it  meatballs is the story of low rent camp northstar and how its counselors deal with the campers as well as one another  then there is much made of their wealthy rivals from across the lake named camp mohawk which culminates in a two day olympiad competition  above it all is bill murray clowning around and making a pretty memorable film debut  br    br   the film is sprinkled with medium sized laughs  chuckles  and more than a few guffaws along the way  the biggest laughs come from the pranks played on the nerdy camp director  three of them involve the counselors moving his bed outside in various locations while he  s sleeping  morty  or   micky   as everyone calls him  wakes up along the side of a road  strung up in some trees several feet above the ground  and finally floating on a raft in the middle of the lake  there are also some funny moments involving the counselors hitting on one another  but this is a pg rated film with little in the way of raunchiness  br    br   the film takes a serious note involving a shy camper named rudy who is played by chris makepeace  of course it  s up to murray to teach the kid how to open up  and give him the confidence he needs to run a marathon during the olympiad  the sentimentality of rudy  s situation seems tacked on to a great degree  notice how when murray first sees the kid sitting alone in the grass after getting off the bus he tells him    you must be the short depressed kid we ordered    makes you wonder if that line was really in the script or murray was just ad libbing while the cameras were rolling  in other words  murray might as well have said to makepeace    you must be that actor we hired to play the stereotypical lonely kid you see in most summer camp films who doesn  t fit in    but before it  s all over  murray  s performance makes this plot device more than bearable  he really seems to have some good chemistry with makepeace  br    br   the film culminates with the games between the two rival camps  very little of the events we are shown are even slightly believable  but   it just doesn  t matter    this is a pretty good film on many levels  don  t let the absurd     rating this film is currently getting scare you off  murray will keep you laughing throughout  just be warned      avoid the sequels     especially the one with corey feldman     of    stars  br    br   the hound               the danish bladerunner   is boldly stated on the box  are you kidding me   this film is a complete drag  when i  m thirsty and go for a soda in the kitchen  i usually pause the vcr  so i won  t miss anything  not this time  i actually found myself looking long and hard in the fridge  just so i wouldn  t have to go back  why the hell is there not one sciencefiction scriptwriter out there who has the vaguest clue about how computers work  it  s mindboggling  one of the premises of film  is that our hero  who  s a hacker   has a little computerassistant to help him  the microsoft office paperclip finally caught on in the future   when he loses the assistant in the movie  he  s helpless and can  t get into any computers  he  s a hacker  it  s like saying  that you can  t drive your car  if you don  t have your lucky   driving cap   on  i won  t even go into the lightning effect when he recieves electroshock               this movie shows a clip of live animal mutilation of an animal getting hacked by a machete and getting its skin ripped off  i know these horrible things happen in the world  but im watching movies based on the fact that what im watching is not actually happening on the screen  these live animal clips are not meant to be in movies  they are meant to show people that belong to certain organizations to help the horrible things that humans to do other species  br    br   this should be banned and destroyed  i have also contacted netflix and other resources to collaborate getting this movie off the market   br    br   this movie should be removed from the public  the person who made this movie needs psychological help             anyone who thinks kool moe dee  carol alt  and corey feldman comprise a list of good actors must be smoking something i  d love to try sometime  where to begin  lousy soundtrack  hammy acting    action   in places  this is the typical amateurishly written hack fodder that washed up has been and never was  s love to star in  i actually felt embarrassed for the   stars   in this   film    the only thespian missing to top this turd was gary coleman  who if he would have been in the movie  would have made it at least somewhat howlingly bad  rather than just plain bad  br    br   there was one part in the film where carol alt screamed    do you think i  m an idiot      yes  carol  i do  your agent does  and please for the love of all that is decent and holy    go away and stop degrading yourself like this  this film is something anna nicole smith would take part in  br    br   i would tell you what the plot was  but that would be one more sentence fragment to this article  plus my mind drifted many times during the movie anyway  so i barely paid attention             this film could have been a decent re make  and gosh knows it tried  or ms  english tried   assembling talented actors together with a successful   experienced writer director should be a formula for a decent film  but ms  english  s experience   according to her imdb bio   is exclusively limited to television work  and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film  br    br   i am surprised that none of the reviews i have read mention what i found most unlikeable about this film  and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential  it looked and felt like it was made for television  to give some credit to ms  english  many of the jokes that simply did not work on a movie screen would have been terrific on tv  and maybe a laugh track would have helped   so much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on tv but looked awkward or odd on a big screen  if the whole film had been chopped up into a mini series or a sit com  i think it could have worked  but this is cinema and sadly ms  english  s talents didn  t translate  i cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors   the writers that i felt like i came out of the theater half shriveled  meg ryan is her usual perky  cute self  except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face   but where did she have a chance to use her talent   she has made films where she doesn  t recreate her stereo typed role and done them well    but not here  annette bening seemed to simply go through the motions   such a great talent and yet such a poor performance  i enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance  and it was sad to see  what worked in this film in the     s doesn  t translate to the     s  and no one helped ms  english get the changes   updates or subtleties right  if only she  as writer  director and producer  had reached out for some assistance  i think it could have been good  but it was not  br    br   it  s so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone  s time   money  this new yorker cartoon i saw yesterday is appropriate  a few movie execs are having a meeting   the caption reads    let  s remake a classic with worse everything               i find it very intriguing that lee radziwill  jackie kennedy  s sister and the cousin of these women  would encourage the maysles   to make   big edie   and   little edie   the subject of a film  they certainly could be considered the   skeletons   in the family closet  the extra features on the dvd include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women  i  d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating   i e    are they nuts  or am i missing something      this movie is hard to come by  netflix does not have it  facets does  though             c  mon guys some previous reviewers have nearly written a novel commenting on this episode  it  s just an old     s tv show   this episode of star trek is notable because of the most serious babe  yeoman barrow  s  ever used on star trek and the fact that it was filmed in a real outdoor location  unlike the tng and voyager series which were totally confined to sound stages  br    br   this use of an outdoor location  and babe  gives proper depth and an almost film like quality to a quite ordinary episode of this now dated and very familiar show  br    br   except a few notable exceptions i e   the city on the edge of forever       assignment earth   and   tomorrow is yesterday   the old series of star trek needs to be seriously moth balled and put out of it  s boring misery  half a dozen good episodes from    is quite a poor batting average  br    br   this is typical of the boring stuff gene roddenberry produced back then actually  contrary to popular belief where some people worshiped the ground he walked on  he actually made a lot of rubbish  he doesn  t deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as irwin allen for example  br    br   just look at the set of the bridge of the enterprise from a modern point of view  they used wobbly plywood for the floor  cafeteria chairs with plastic backs and cheap cardboard above the instrument panels  you can clearly see the folds in the paper   every expense spared or what              i just watched this movie on it  s premier night out of curiosity and sheer nostalgia  i liked  not loved    mork   mindy   as a kid  mostly for robin william  s zany energetic performance  this movie made me remember why  was the original show great  not really  but robin certainly was  which brings me to this movie  br    br   i was pleasantly surprised  expecting nothing more than a paint by numbers chronological retelling of the show  which in a way it was   but  of course  the real focus was on robin  it was interesting to see robin  s journey from struggling street jester to national t v star  and how such a drastic difference affected him and his long suffering wife  and my hat is off to star chris diamantopoulos as he portrayed mr  williams with integrity  sensitivity  and heart  not just a cute impression  although it was even dead on   on an unrelated note  i noticed that robin  s struggles were in some ways similar to andy kaufman  who was under appreciated by network t v  and held back creatively  but that  s the   taxi   behind the scenes biopic   br    br   all in all  this was a very enjoyable flick  in which i felt i got to know a little more of the man behind the orkan  the acting was solid by all  never melodramatic like i suspected  and the story moved along well  performances that were particularly good were by those who played garry marshall and john belushi  the scene in which belushi heckles robin was a hoot    not a great masterpiece by any means  i would have liked to have seen a tad more about pam dawber   but definitely watchable  especially for those robin williams and   mork   mindy   fans out there  nanoo  nanoo             i caught this film on azn on cable  it sounded like it would be a good film  a japanese   green card    i can  t say i  ve ever disliked an asian film  quite the contrary  some of the most incredible horror films of all time are japanese and korean  and i am a huge fan of john woo  s hong kong films  i an not adverse to a light hearted films  like tampopo or chung king express  two of my favourites   so i thought i would like this  well  i would rather slit my wrists and drink my own blood than watch this laborious  badly acted film ever again  br    br   i think the director steven okazaki must have spiked the water with quaalude  because no one in this film had a personality  and when any of the characters did try to act  as opposed to mumbling a line or two  their performance came across as forced and incredibly fake  i honestly did not think that anyone had ever acted before   the only person who sounded genuine was brenda aoki   i find it amazing that this is promoted as a comedy  because i didn  t laugh once  even more surprising is that cbs morning news called this   a refreshing breath of comedy    it was neither refreshing  nor a breath of comedy  and the ending was very predictable  the previous reviewer must be an idiot to think such things  br    br   avoid this film unless you want to see a boring predictable plot line and wooden acting  i actually think that   spike of bensonhurst   is a better acted film than this   and i walked out half way through that film             before i begin  let me get something off my chest  i  m a huge fan of john eyres   first film project  shadowchaser  the film  a b grade cross of both the terminator   die hard  may not be the work of a cinematic genius  but is a hugely entertaining action film that became a cult hit    spawned two sequels   a spin off   br    br   judge and jury begins with joseph meeker  a convicted killer who was sent to death row following his capture after the so called   bloody shootout    which seems like a poor name for a killing spree    meeker kills three people while trying to rob a convenience store   being led to the electric chair  there is an amusing scene where meeker talks to the priest about living for sex but meeting his one true love  who was killed during the shootout   expressing his revenge for the person who killed her    michael silvano  a washed up football star who spends his days watching his son alex practicing football with his high school team  and ends up harassing his son  s coach   but once executed  meeker returns as a revenant  or as kelly perine calls   a hamburger without the fries     whose sole aim is to get his revenge  which basically means making silvano  s life a misery  br    br   let me point out the fact that judge and jury is not a true horror film  it is a supernatural action film  with meeker chasing silvano  using his ability to change form  which amounts to david keith dressing up as everything from an elvis impersonator  a french chef  with an accent as bad as his moustache   a drag queen  a clown   a stand up comedian   a shotgun which fires explosive rounds   an invulnerability to death  although that doesn  t stop martin kove from shooting keith with a desert eagle   to pay silvano back for killing meeker  s wife  br    br   director john eyres does not seem interested in characterisations  instead focusing solely on action scenes  which the film has plenty of  but that is the film  s main flaw  since there  s nothing to connect the action scenes together  the acting is surprisingly good  with keith delivering the best performance  supported ably by kove  as well as paul koslo  who plays the washed up cop quite well  kelly perine is annoying as the cabbie who tries to help but makes the situation worse             ye lou  s film purple butterfly pits a secret organization  purple butterfly  against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai  ding hui  zhang ziyi  and her ex lover hidehiko itami  toru nakamura  find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting  br    br   i agree with the reviewer from paris  the film substitutes a convoluted  semi historical conflict for a plot  without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes  the sudden time shifting doesn  t help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless  normally i don  t mind dark movies  but the absence of light  the bone jarringly shaky camera footage  and the generally bad film making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in  i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film   has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography    but i don  t think that helps the movie  the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the   th century  and i don  t believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film  the overly melodramatic moments don  t add to its watchability  br    br   the actors are all suitably melancholy  zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films  brooding and looking generally annoyed  however  at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator  br    br   all in all  a very disappointing film  especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he                  after hearing about george orwell  s prophetic masterpiece for all of my life  i  m now     but never having read the book  i am totally confused as to what i  ve just seen  br    br   i am very familiar with the concepts covered in the novel  as i  m sure most are  but only through hearsay and quotes  without this limited knowledge this film would have been a complete mystery  and even with it i  m still no more educated about the story of      than i was before i watched it  br    br   on the plus side    br    br   the cinematography is amazing  hurt   burton deliver fine performances and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and desolate  the prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film making  br    br   now for the down sides  and there are plenty    br    br   there is a war going on   at least as far as the propaganda is concerned   but why   with who  nothing is explained  there are a couple of names bandied about  eurasia etc   but they mean nothing without explanation  br    br   who is winston  what does he do  where does he come from  where does he work  why is he changing news reports  why isn  t he on the front line  why doesn  t he eat the food in the canteen  what is that drink he  s drinking through the entire film  why is he so weak   ill  why isn  t he brainwashed like the rest of them  what  s the deal with his mother   sister  what happened to his father  a little back story would have been nice  no scrub that  essential for those like myself that haven  t read the book  without it  this is just a confusing and hard to follow art house movie that constantly keeps you guessing at what is actually going on  br    br   the soundtrack was dis jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter from the big brother screens swamps the dialogue in places making it even harder to work out whats going on  i accept that this may have been an artistic choice but it  s very annoying all the same  br    br   also  i know this has been mentioned before  but why all the nudity  it just seemed totally gratuitous and felt like it had been thrown in there to make up for the lack of any plot coverage  br    br   i personally can  t abide the way hollywood feels it has to explain story lines word for word these days  we are not all brainwashed simpletons  but this is a few steps too far the other way  i can only imagine that it totally relies on the fact that you  ve read the book because if this film really is the   literal translation   that i  ve seen many people say  i would find it very hard to understand why      is hailed as the classic it is  br    br   there  s no denying that it was light years ahead of it  s time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society to date   maybe this has been a sort of bible to the powers that be    but many sci fi novelists have done the same without leaving gaping holes in the storyline  br    br   i guess i have to do what i should have done from the start and buy a copy of the book if i  m to make any sense out of this  br    br   all in all  very disappointed in something i  ve waited for years to watch             this cute animated short features two comic icons   betty boop and henry  br    br   henry is the bald  slightly portly boy from the comics who never speaks  br    br   well here he does speak  br    br   he wants to get a puppy from betty boop  s pet store  and when he is left to mind the store   some hilarious hijinks ensue  br    br   betty sings a song about pets  henry gets in a battle with birds and a monkey  but everything works out in the end             i just got back from this free screening  and this   osama witch project   is the hands down worst film i  ve seen this year  worse than even   catwoman     which had the decency to at least pass itself off as fiction  br    br   in   september tapes    a   film crew   of   documentary journalists   heads to afghanistan   despite being thoroughly unprepared for the trip  the conditions and  oh yeah  the psychotic and ridiculous vendetta of their filmmaker leader to avenge his wife  s death on sept       to track down osama bin laden  br    br   they   made   eight tapes on their journey  which now   document   their travels and  of course  their attempts to kill the terrorist leader   the eight tapes  thankfully  all end at points significant in the narrative  which is convenient for a   documentary     br    br   the psychotic  idiotic protagonist   who is given to long  significant speeches that he probably learned watching   macgyver     cares nothing for his own life or the life of his innocent crew as he gets them further and further into danger through a series of completely dumb mishaps  i don  t know why he didn  t just wear a sign on his back that said   shoot me    br    br   the crew  s translator  supposedly their sensible voice of reason  does little more than whine and gets baffled as the idiot hero leads them into doom   br    br   you wish they  d brought along someone on their trip to call them all morons  br    br   around   tape      i began rooting for the terrorists to shoot the film crew             i remember seeing this film in the theater in      when i was   years old  you do the math   i absolutely loved it  i was tarzan for the   weeks after seeing it  climbing the furniture  jumping around making monkey sounds   it started a fascination with tarzan and monkeys  but oddly enough a longer lasting love for christopher lambert  keep in mind that i saw highlander very shortly after this        was the last time i saw that film  until about a month ago  it happened to be on cable as i was getting ready for bed at      am and even though it was late and i was tired and i had to be at work at      am  i stayed up to watch this movie that i loved as a kid   br    br   upon viewing it i realized that it was not that great of a film and even odder then that  that andie macdowell  s voice was dubbed by someone else  ian holme was of course solid as usual  and surprisingly the monkey suits still kind of held up  but what was most surprising was how good lambert was as tarzan  he was great  the depth he managed to capture in so few lines  his primal body language and most importantly his ability to bring this character through its extremely large ark  were just amazing  br    br   as i stated earlier i am lambert fan  but i  m used to highlander  the hunted and fortress  in this film he was really quite good and it is a shame that he never got a chance to portray a character with such depth again  br    br   so to make a short story way too long  i was a little disappointed that the film was not that good  but i was glad to see that lambert was good and i do not regret staying up until     am to see it             a family is traveling through the mid west  there  s widower ben  charles bateman   his girlfriend nicky  ahna capri  and ben  s little daughter k t   geri reischl   then hit a town named hillsboro where everyone acts more than a little strangely  their car breaks down and they  re forced to stay  they soon find out a witches coven has a spell over the town and is up to incredible evil  br    br   the story is not that good  people just figure things out of nothing and they just happen to find out where the witches are at the end  also there are a lot of loopholes left dangling at the end  the acting is pretty poor too  bateman and capri are bland and everybody else is about the same  only old pros strother martin and l q  jones give good performances  still this movie does work  it forgoes blood and gore  there  s some but this is pg  and manges to work with some very creepy visuals and atmosphere  the acting hampers a lot of it but it still works  martin especially chews the scenery in his role  i can  t explain exactly why i  sort of  like this movie but it did work on me  it  s a quiet kind of horror that isn  t made anymore  hardly a masterwork but this deserves to be rediscovered  a               francis ford coppola wrote and directed this stunningly personal story of a married woman  s flight from her husband  and the reality that perhaps the youthful glee and excitement of her younger years are behind her  we learn little about this woman  s marriage except that she has been feeling her independence slipping away as of late  she  s also recently learned she  s pregnant  which has further complicated her heart  she doesn  t want to be a complacent wifey  despite the maternal way she speaks to her husband over the phone   she meets two men on her journey  a former college football hero who  after an accident during a game  has been left with permanent brain damage  and a sexy  strutting motorcycle cop who has a great deal of trouble in his own life  the clear  clean landscapes  as photographed by the very talented wilmer butler  are astutely realized  as are the characters  shirley knight  james caan  and robert duvall each deliver strong  gripping performances  most especially since these are not very likable people in conventional terms  some scenes  such as knight  s first call home from a pay phone  or her first night alone with caan where they play   simon says    are almost too intimate to watch  coppola toys with reality  turning the jagged memories of his characters into scrapbooks we  ve been made privy to  he allows scenes to play out  yet the editing is quite nimble and the film is never allowed to get too heavy  there are at least two or three very frisky moments   it  s a heady endeavor  so much so that the picture was still being shown at festivals nearly five years later  some may shun coppola  s unapologetic twisting of events in order to underline the finale with bitter irony  however the forcefulness and drive behind the picture nearly obliterate its shortcomings      from                this movie was not very well directed  they almost totally disregarded the book i guess they were trying   save time  the only upside   me was that the actor who played finny was cute  some of the dialog between the main characters appeared a little gay which was not the case in the book  major parts of the book were once again chopped out you lost the over all effect it was not as haunting as the book and left me lacking severely  also the strong language although it was brief was very unnecessary  also i was surprised   not pleasantly  by a new character that was no where in the book one of my favorite characters  leper  was poorly interpreted and portrayed  he seemed more sinister in the movie than the real leper was in the book  over all disappointing            the buzz for this film has always been about the fabulous graphics that make kevin bacon disappear  sadly  they stopped there  they should have continued to make the script disappear  then the silly set  and finally every visible element of this film  because  there  s nothing else there to show  br    br   gary thompson and andrew marlowe are listed as the writing credits for this film  i don  t really think they exist  i think they bought this script at   scripts r us    where you buy a standard blank   monster movie   script and just fill in the blanks  there  s a monster stalking us  let  s split up   they actually   let  s split up   in this movie   hit alien giant bug monster invisible man with crowbar  not dead yet  burn huge rabbit shark invisible man in unsurvivable fire  not dead yet  you know  the standard stuff  even the minimum number of elements that were specific to an invisible man movie  ir glasses  spraying with something like paint  were handled badly   br    br   what is sad is that there were lots of possibilities for this to be a fascinating movie  they psychological issues for the subject  the deterioration of the mind due to the process  treating an invisible subject  and many other ideas were touched on for usually less than   seconds and would have been far more interesting  had there been any desire to save kevin bacon in the end  it would have been a much better movie  all in all  it stunk  br    br   i would mention some of the incredibly stupid elements of the ending of the movie  but i don  t want to do any spoilers  suffice it to say that these characters are so stupid they don  t think about pulling the plug on a machine rather than               a young girl becomes a war time marine  s pen pal  and when he visits at war  s end expecting someone a bit more   available    comic complications ensue  all ultimately works out well  naturally  but not before everyone involved has thoroughly chewed the scenery  errol flynn  s dead on impression of humphrey bogart from   casablanca   is a highlight  as are various send ups of his own swashbuckling image  the   jumping   scene in the kitchen with forrest tucker is a riot   it is tucker  though  who   tucks   the movie under his arm  lowers his head and barrels over the goal line  he demonstrates the comic flair more fully developed twenty years later in   f troop   and imparts a liveliness and energy that flynn repeatedly plays off to raise his own performance  eleanor parker does a fine job as the woman being pursued  and little patti brady charms as tucker  s actual pen pal friend  a fine  lightweight   coming home   comedy in a genteel setting that children and romantics of all ages should find entertaining             this movie is a perfect adaptation of the english flick unfaithful  ashmit plays the role of richard gere  emran that of olivier and malikka the perfect cheating wife role of lane they have changed the second half of the film to adapt for the indian masses   br    br   even then the movie has got the full traces of unfaithful  though it couldn  t catch up with the original  it was a cheap soft porn of the bollywood lovers  where mallika showed a lot more skin than anyone dared to show  emran did more roles like this and was even nicknamed the serial killer  in the future if the indian directors plan to remake a english movie then they have to look into the feasibility of the plot with the indian censors  though the film bombed at the box office  the actors got the undue recognition  in future the directors should be a little more careful in remaking a oscar nominated film   br    br   all said  this is not a family film  so take the extra caution while watching it at home with family             robert altman  s downbeat  new fangled western from edmund naughton  s book   mccabe   was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following  aside from a completely convincing boom town scenario  the characters here don  t merit much interest  and the picture looks  intentionally  brackish and unappealing  bearded warren beatty plays a turn of the century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel  once the profits start coming in  beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action  altman creates a solemn  wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place  but the action in this sorry little town is limited  most of the story being made up of vignettes  and altman  s pacing is deliberately slow  there  s hardly a statement being made  just the opposite  in fact  and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds  it  s a self defeating picture  and yet  in an altman quirky way  it wears defeat proudly     from                 what seemed at first just another introverted french flick offering no more than baleful sentiment became for me  on second viewing  a genuinely insightful and quite satisfying presentation  br    br   spoiler of sorts follows  br    br   poor cedric  he apparently didn  t know what hit him  poor audience  we were at first caught up in what seemed a really beautiful and romantic story only to be led back and forth into the dark reality of mismatch  these two guys just didn  t belong together from their first ambiguous encounter  as much as mathieu and cedric were sexually attracted to each other  the absence of a deeper emotional tie made it impossible for mathieu  an intellectual being  to find fulfillment in sharing life with someone whose sensibilities were more attuned to carnival festivities and romps on the beach  br    br   on a purely technical note  i loved the camera action in this film  subtitles were totally unnecessary  even though my french is   presque rien    i could watch it again without the annoying english translation and enjoy it even more  this was a polished  very professionally made motion picture  though many scenes seem superfluous  i rate it nine out of ten             i don  t think i  ve ever gave something a      rating  but this one easily gets the denomination  i find it hard just to sit through one of his jokes  it  s not just that the jokes are so bad  but combine that with the fact that carson daily has zero charisma  can  t set up or finish a punchline  and you  ve got a late night comedy recipe that will really turn your stomach  br    br   i have watched the show  never in its entirety  but many times still  it just creeps up on me after conan  i usually watch a minute or two just to see if carson daily is still the worst talk show host ever  br    br   actually if you ever do see him interviewing a guest  it  s just that  an interview  i feel so sorry every time he has a guest on and their confused smiles try to mask their body language that  s screaming    get me the hell away from this freak    i do recommend watching the show  not for a laugh  but to ponder  how he got on the air and what he  s still doing there  watch as much as you can  i think you will find its complete awkwardness   interesting             in the standard view  this is a purely awful movie  however  it rates a near perfect score on the unintentional comedy scale  i can think of few actual comedies that make me laugh as hard as i did watching this movie  andy griffith  s ghost dressed in native american garb dancing sends me into hysterics everytime  i wouldn  t waste the gas or energy driving to the video store to rent it  but if you happen to be laying on the couch at   in the morning and it comes on tv  check it out             from the film  s first shot   keira knightley as elizabeth bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn  thus invoking all the clich  s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong minded rebellious female character in period drama   i knew i was in for something to make me want to kill myself  br    br   joe wright seemed not only to have not read the book  but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact jane austen  s subtle  nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling  delicate social interaction in eighteenth century english drawing rooms  but a sort of u certificate wuthering heights  thus we were treated to every scene between elizabeth and darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason  in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain  not to mention that jane austen  and in particular p   p  is not about passion  sexual tension or love  it  s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society  which was completely ignored  so that the bennets   house was a rambunctious  chaotic place where everybody shouts at once  runs around  leaves their underwear on chairs  and pigs wander happily through the house  the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a matrix reloaded style dance orgy  and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety  br    br   the genius of jane austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety  and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap  so both the brilliance of jane austen and the very factor that allows her plots   particularly in this film   to function was completely erased  subtlety in general was nowhere int his film  sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances  br    br   it was so obviously trying to be a  serious  film  the humour   which is pride   prejudice  both austen  s methodology and her appeal   was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po faced melodrama  and when it was allowed in  was handled so clumsily  pride   prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points  yes  but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour  they are embedded in it  you can  t lose jane austen  s technique  leaving only the bare bones of the story  and expect the themes to remain  not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy handed mystical numinous fauxbrow cinematography  br    br   elizabeth bennett is supposed to be a woman  an adult  mature and sensible and clear sighted  keira knightley played the first half of the film like an empty headed giggling schoolgirl  and the second half like an empty headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine  elizabeth  s wit  her combative verbal exchanges  her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody  s follies including her own  her strength and composure  and her fantastic clear sightedness were completely lost and replaced with     what  a lot of giggling and staring into the distance  rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs  she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation   and not genuinely raging  either  no  these were petulant hissy fits  and where the great strength of austen  s elizabeth  at least in austen  s eyes  was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety  knightley  s elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention  furthermore  she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong minded  and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it  an astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance  in which quest for blandness and weakness  she was ably matched by matthew macfayden  br    br   donald sutherland as mr bennet seemed weak  ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes mr bennet so fascinating and tragic  his special bond with lizzie  as the only two sensible people in a world of fools  was completely lost  not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools  and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact  mr bingley was no longer amiable and well meaning to the point of folly  but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs  and the woman who was playing jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all  the script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of jane austen   delivered with remarkable clumsiness   and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy  br    br   just get the bbc adaptation on dvd and save yourself the heartache             i  ve always enjoyed films that depict life as it is  life sometimes has boring patches  no real plot  and not necessarily a happy ending    a river runs through it   is the perfect name for this film  and norman maclean  s novel   life ebbs and flows like a river  and it has it  s rough spots  but it is a wonderful trip  br    br   robert redford brings a lot to the film  his narration has a friendly feel that fits the picture perfectly  as a director  he is restrained and calm  and captures some incredibly beautiful scenes  as for the acting  craig sheffer and brad pitt work surprising well as brothers  i don  t know quite how to describe tom skerritt and brenda blethyn  s performances  except that they truly feel real    a river runs through it   is a wonderful film  br    br       out of               the story is very trustworthy and powerful  the technical side of the movie is quite fine   even the directing of it  the main problem is with the castings  that turned that movie into almost another local and regular clich   with a great lack of impact and even greater lack of impression  beside the small role of the father  rafael  played impressively by asi dayan   all other actors were unfortunately not in their best  the role of the elder blind girl  played by taly sharon  was fresh but without any intensity as the leading role  therefore the figure she acted had become mild and low profile  there were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie  but after all it  s a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future             this movie was not so much promoted here in greece even though it got good actors   great script and rather good photograph was not a so called   blockbuster   movie in my country  the movie itself is very powerful it  s about the hard time that a newcomer had to go through when he returns in his home village after been released from a  yo prison time drugs  the end is rather sad     mourikis is trying to keep up with his part and he handles it pretty well    lambropoulou is great and very sexy in a strange way and of course hatzisavvas is for one more time close to excellency      out of    because very few greek movies can make such an impression             mystery men has got to be the stupidest film i  ve ever seen  but what a film  i thought it was fabulous  excellent and impressive  it was funny  well done and nice to see ridiculous super heroes for a change  and being able to pull it off  this was great  i  ll definitely watch it again             you know that mouthwash commercial where the guy has a mouth full of listerine or whatever it is and he  s trying really hard to keep from spitting it up into the sink  that  s a great metaphor for this movie  i kept watching  even though it was really difficult  but keeping mouthwash in your mouth will leave you with a minty fresh feeling  this movie left me with a bad taste in my mouth  i should have spit it out when i had the chance  br    br   the premise is corny enough to be fun  for the first time in like a thousand years  gargoyles have returned to romania  and all of the priests who knew how to fight and kill these things are long dead  it  s up to michael pare and some other secret agents to get to the bottom of things before the gargoyles run amok  unfortunately  the premise is completely lost in bad dialog and less than enthusiastic acting on the part of the human leads  the best acting is done by the cg gargoyles  br    br   in the end  this movie feels like a poor man  s van helsing  if you check your brain at the door  this might get you through a dreary monday night  i gave it   out of    stars             i can  t believe it that was the worst movie i have ever seen in my life  i laughed a couple of times    probably because of how stupid it was   if someone paid me to see that movie again i wouldn  t  the plot was so horrible   it made no sense   and the acting was so bad that i couldn  t even tell if they were trying  that movie was terrible rating  f            this is one of a rarity of movies  where instead of a bowl of popcorn one should watch it with a bottle of vodka  to be completely honest we are a group of people who actually know the man  mo ogrodnik  and decided to drink ourselves stupid to this film  br    br   the cinematic aspect of wolfgang

  br    br   about    minutes into this game  none of us could see straight  the sheer amount of dido  s in the first thirty minutes created enough reasons to drink to pacify an elephant there was something secretly pleasurable about seeing two underage girls hit on a kurt cobain lookalike with absolutely no context  save for his mysterious scene at the convenience store where he was oh so naturally reading a local newspaper  because that  s what we all do  the heart shaped glasses were delightfully derivative of lolita  and something about that provocative scene of the nude chin up boy suggests the director  s history of homosexual pornographic experiments  we wish we were kidding  br    br   enough intellectual contemplation  on to the drinking game  this will ensure that the viewing experience is a positive one  it  s very simple  and very likely to send at least one member of your party to immediate care  br    br   the mo ogrodnik ripe drinking game     every time you

 jr             even though i  m quite young  the beatles are my absolutely favourite band  i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember  br    br   it  s the sort of film that is worth trying the once  i can see why it wasn  t released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv  i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film  it didn  t much details except something like    john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up  jared harris stars    i  d never heard of him  he played john  or aiden quinn who played paul  however they are certainly underestimated actors  br    br   the film had a slow start but as it developed  i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters  as a huge fan  i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like  the script was brilliant and harris got lennon  s accent  personality and mannerisms spot on  quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent  the make up artists made them look excellent  br    br   this paragraph may be counted as a  spoiler   br    br   as i mentioned before  it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film  i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians  as for lennon  s rude line in the italian restaurant  totally unnecessary  the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it  br    br   it is quite different from the other biographical films i  ve seen where it  s about how the beatles got together and became famous  and those never really did the characters that well  e g    backbeat    br    br   in conclusion  i would say  if you  re a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan  give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise  at only about    minutes long  it  s worth waiting for the film to develop  br    br   if anyone does know whether the meeting of      really did happen please send it to the   comments page   for this film  i  d be very interested             an american werewolf in london had some funny parts  but this one isn  t so good  the computer werewolves are just awful  the perspective is all off  it  s like seeing them through a distorting mirror  the writers step on the throat of many of their gags  american boy says to parisian girl    is there a cafe   around here    instead of just leaving it at that  they have to have the girl sigh and respond    this is paris               originally i was a tenacious d fan of their first album and naturally listened to a few tracks off the p o d  and was rather disappointed  after watching the movie  my view was changed  the movie is pretty funny from beginning to the end and found my self engaged in it even though it was really was a stupid storyline because of the attitudes that kg and jaybles portray in the movie   br    br   much more entertaining and enjoyable than movies i have seen in the theaters lately  ex  saw iii  dull and dragging   casino royale  way to homo erotic  which in prior installments i have really enjoyed  br    br   if you enjoyed borat  you will enjoy the tale of the greatest band on earth            this is just one more of those hideous films that you find on lifetime tv which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner  along with other such nasty films as   the burning bed      enough    or   monster    this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why she  s not such a bad person after all  give us a break  here  s my question to the filmmakers  if letourneau were a man  and vili were a    year old girl  would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person  answer  hell no  br    br   imagine switching the genders in this film  and then you  ll see just why myself and others here consider this a worthless piece of garbage  were the genders switched  there would be no attempt to empathize with the criminal  instead  we  d likely be treated to a portrayal of a monstrous and hideous man preying upon a young girl  his lascivious behavior landing him in prison  and his brainwashed victim suffering from stockholm syndrome  the only reason letourneau does not receive the same treatment in this film is by virtue of her sex  br    br   let  s call a spade a spade  letourneau is a pedophile  plain and simple  no ifs  ands or buts  she  s a criminal who belongs in prison  and deserves our derision and contempt  but certainly not our pity or empathy             the premise of this movie was decent enough  but with sub par acting  it was just bland and dull  br    br   spoilers the film does not work because of the nature of the death  it was accidental  so although it was a murder it wasn  t like the guy set out to do it  also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree  there is no emotion in this film  the first    minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister  and hearing her message  it was dull and boring  br    br   with some polishing  and better acting it could have been pretty good             the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy  quaint streets and sunshine  i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere  but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere  br    br   othello works for big  fat mr  karva  his crime boss step dad  at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it  s never really defined  but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers  so trust me  he  s a prick  doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand jobs  one of his colleagues is runner  a black dude who is always dashing from a to b  until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running  runner dumps the lost boy in othello  s flat  where he promptly starts granting more wishes  keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled  karva has the boy kidnapped  but he isn  t sure of what would really bring him happiness  is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand job  either way  i don  t want to see the little boy grant him the second  br    br   it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes  the ending tries to be shocking but since there  s hardly any back story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience  br    br   writer tony grisoni  a favourite of terry gilliam  tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell  ironically  if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film  as it is  we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy  who  s origins are never revealed  that  s just plain irritating   br    br   aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score  this film has little to recommend             i can  t emphasize it enough  do  not  get this movie for the kids  br    br   for that matter  you  d best spare the adults from it as well  br    br   all right  perhaps i  m overexaggerating a little  this isn  t the worst kids   movie    no  let me rephrase that  this isn  t the worst movie made by dissilusioned adults for dissilusioned adults and somehow marketed towards kids  that would be   jack    which i  ve been meaning to review   gut like a fish   br    br   adults won  t learn anything surprising  well  if you must  fast forward to just before the end credits for a educational bit about an interesting cosmic phenominon   we don  t usually end up doing as adults what we wanted to do as kids as reality tends to get in the way  well  duh  i could have told you that  so can four years of college at an art school  but i degress   br    br   i have no idea what the heck kids could possibly get out of this movie  most likely it will only upset them  we get to watch the moment when russ was traumatized at eight years old   there  s a better movie    kiki  s delivery service    that has essentially the same message but handles it litely instead of drilling it into your head  and the adults will like it too  br    br   by the way  there is a moment in the movie made with amature mst k ers in mind  if they think of that other bruce willis movie with a sad little kid in it             is nothing else on tv  are you really bored  well  then watch phat beach  however  don  t rent it and definitely do not buy it  that would be a big mistake  br    br   i watched this on tv and found myself laughing at certain points  i did not laugh long and i did not laugh hard  however  there were subtle jokes and comments i laughed at  if you are looking for an extremely funny   hood   movie then watch friday  if you are looking for a powerful emotional movie  something that this movie tries at  kind of  watch something like hoop dreams or jason  s lyric  if you are lookin for some good black   booty   go watch a dominique simone porn flick  because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent  however  if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable  go ahead and watch it  you will be slightly amused  br    br        out of                  the elegant documentary   br    br   don  t watch this movie     if you  re an egotistical know all student of physics  this much less than one percent  miniscule fraction  of the population may find that this show just tells them what they have already learned and already know  br    br   do watch this movie    if you  re one of the massive majority of people that fall into the greater than     of the population that does not study or already have a sound knowledge of the theories of physics including relativity  quantum  string and m theory  br    br   what a brilliantly architected documentary  starting with some helpful historical background you will be lead step by elegant step into a universe of pure magic   and dimensions beyond  i have always had a huge appreciation of mathematics  this movie can easily give you an insight into what an exquisitely beautiful language mathematics is without making you feel like you  re about to fail the grade  br    br   the show is repetitive at times as the original format was a mini series split over three shows  it therefore makes sense to give us polite little reminders of the principles being presented  i found this immensely helpful as it kept reminding me of the multitude of questions and possible answers that make up this amazing tapestry of our very existence  br    br   we are all  and everything around us  is vibrational energy with a natural tendency towards harmony  this movie may blow your mind   or at least help you realize that the universe is far far bigger than that which we see around us  even with the hubble telescope  and far far smaller than the protons and neutrons within the atoms we learned about in high school  m theory holds many magnificent magnitudes of   possibility    br    br   it just seemed so appropriate that all of this elegance should by it  s very nature move  by admission by the many brilliant scientists presenting  out of the realm of science and into the realm of philisophy  br    br   you do not have to be religious at all to feel like this movie brought you one step closer to god  br    br   bravo brian greene  well done indeed  br    br   p s  if you  re interested in feeling even more comfortable and at home in your place in the universe and would like some more insight into the   possibilities   quantum mechanics blended with spirituality  of all things  can bring then i highly recommend that you also watch   what the bleep     down the rabbit hole    yes i know they make a few silly mistakes by suggesting a shaman may not be able to see a boat if he hasn  t seen one before  my eyes process light reflections just fine   i see things everyday that i  ve never seen before  and brain cells are cells in the body that actually don  t divide  but if you can get over these little hurdles and put down the things you don  t like and hang on to those that you do   there is a lot to like about this film  br    br   then watch   the secret         documentary about the law of attraction   search for imdb title   tt            this information just might change your life profoundly   forever  if you search deeper you might even find the universe is talking to us with thought  if you  ll listen    and some are   and that is truly incredible  there is a modern day jesus mohammad buddha  those  among others  that history suggests have communicated with the non physical  alive today and she lives in texas  i know some of you know what i  m talking about  br    br   i do not consider myself religious by any traditional definition but i have never felt more at home or as comfortable in the universe as i do now             in       with the success of the first season of batman  the animated series  warner brothers commissioned the team responsible for the hit show with producing a feature length movie  originally slated for direct to video  but bumped up to theatrical status  it would become known as batman  mask of the phantasm  ten years after phantasm  we have had an additional three feature films released from the boys at the wb  sub zero  return of the joker  and now  mystery of the batwoman joins the family  br    br   the plot is basic and in many ways similar to mask of the phantasm  a new female vigilante modeling herself after batman has begun targeting operations run by gotham mob boss rupert thorne and oswald cobblepot aka the penguin  now  batman must attempt to unravel the mystery of the batwoman before she crosses the line  br    br   the animation is the sleeker  futuristic style that was utilized for batman  the animated series   fifth and sixth seasons  aka the new batman adventures     it  s quite nicely done  and just as sleek as return of the joker  s animation  there is also some use of cgi  but it  s minor compared to the overabundance of it in sub zero  the music was alright  different and exotic and similar to the justice league score  although the points in the score when the old animated batman theme comes up will be sure to send waves of nostalgia through the older fans   rodent shaped hearts  br    br   kevin conroy  as always  does a wonderful job as bruce wayne and batman  it  s also great to have the old batman  the animated series alumni back  that includes bob hastings  commissioner gordon   robert costanzo  detective bullock   tara strong  barbara gordon batgirl  her cameo hints at the romantic relationship between her and bruce that was mentioned in batman beyond   and efrem zimbalist jr  alfred   br    br   villains were also great   especially given that rupert thorne  the old mob boss from the original series  appears for the first time since the fourth season  br    br   overall  while not quite reaching the standard set by mask of the phantasm ten years ago  motb carries on the torch quite nicely for the animated batman films  and if you have the dvd and are a hardcore fan  you will love the five minute short chase me             i think this movie was supposed to be shocking  but the only way in which it is indeed shocking is how shocking badly it  s been made    and simply is  it  s one and a half hour of torment  even more so for the viewer than for the characters in the movie  the five girls   br    br   sure the main characters get their bloody piece in a bad way  which is basically fine  since it  s a horror movie  and i  usually  like horror movies  i  ve no problem with violence in these type of movies per se  however all the violence in this film serves no end whatsoever  it  s no spectacle other than that it  s simply grotesque  it  s so lame it even gets boring  and really quick too  br    br   the worst thing  if the above wasn  t bad enough for ya  about this movie is that they  ve tried to copy the blair whitch project  by filming with cheap hand held cameras  but  again  this too  serves no end whatsoever  in the   blair which    sure enough  there  s an explanation  namely they are their with a camera looking for the blair witch  in this film  there  s no other explanation than    hey ya  ll we wanted this to look like the blair whitch     the sound in the movie is also something to get depressed about  the girls are screaming so hysterically that many a time you can  t make out what they  re saying  also  no effort has been made to make anything any better  sound wise or other wise  br    br   than finally  there  s the soundtrack  which is just as bad as the rest  and varies from cheap euro house to the worst grungy hard rock    br    br   my advise  don  t watch this under any circumstances             why can  t a movie be rated a zero  or even a negative number  some movies such as   plan nine from outer space   are so bad they  re fun to watch  this is not one    the dungeon of horror   might be the worst movie i  ve ever seen  some of anyway  i had to fast forward through a lot of it    fortunately for the indiscretions of my youth and senility of my advancing age  there may be worse movies i  ve seen  but thankfully  i can  t remember them  the sets appeared to be made with cardboard and finished with cans of spray paint  the special effects looked like a fifth grader  s c  diorama set in a shoebox  the movie contained unforgivable gaffs such as when the marquis shoots and kills his servant  he then immediately gets into a scuffle with his escaping victim  who takes his flintlock and shoots him with it  without the gun having been reloaded  this movie was so bad my dvd copy only had name credits  i guess no company or studio wanted to be incriminated  though i guess when you film in your garage and make sets out of cardboard boxes a studio isn  t needed  this movie definitely ranks in my cellar of all time worst movies with such horrible sacrileges as   the manipulator    the worst movie i have ever seen with an actual  one time  hollywood leading man mickey rooney  the only time i would recommend watching   the dungeon of harrow    or   the manipulator   for that matter  would be if someone were to pay you   i  m kind of cheap  i  d have to have    or    bucks for   dungeon   and at least ten for   manipulator    phil the never out of the can cinematographer            this movie took me by surprise  the opening credit sequence features nicely done animation  after that  we  re plunged into a semi cheesy production  betraying its low budget  the characters  typical american teens  are introduced slowly  with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this  by the time the shlitz hits the fan  we know each one of the characters  and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities  it  s a slow uphill set up  kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster  thankfully  once the action kicks in  it  s full blown old school horror  steve johnson  s make up effects are awesome  equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films  and the scares are jolting  kevin tenney delivers his best movie ever  with heart stopping surprises and creepy suspenseful set ups  the tongue in cheek  sometimes cheesy  humor marks this film as pure   s horror  as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like   night of the living dead   or   hills have eyes    but for true horror fans  this one is worth checking out  play it as the first entry on a double bill with the      remake of   house on the haunted hill    the set up and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking             though i  d heard that   cama de gato   was the worst brazilian movie of the decade  i watched it giving it a chance  after all  first time director producer writer alexandre stockler managed to make his debut feature  shot in video  for just us        and    though it looks even cheaper    i can  t begin to imagine all he went through to finally get it exhibited in theaters with no big sponsors or production companies behind it  then as i watched it i realized why   but whatever chances you  re ready to give to   cama de gato    they shrink to zero within    minutes  it  s an unbelievably preposterous  verbose  ideologically fanatical and technically catastrophic attempt to portray brazilian upper middle class youth as a bunch of spoiled neo nazis hooked on bad sex  drugs and violence  and they  re made to look like closeted gays too   made with no visible trace of talent  imagination  expertise or notion of structure  visually and aurally  it recalls the worst amateur stuff you can find on youtube    only here it lasts ninety two  count  em  minutes of unrelenting hysteria and clumsiness  and it  s not even funny bad  br    br   we  ve all seen the story before  bored young guys want to have fun  go partying  take drugs and everything goes wrong    there  s gang rape  spanking  murder  the accidental death  falling down the staircase    of the mother of one of the boys  culminating with the boys deciding to burn the corpses of the girl and the mother in a garbage landfill  moral and literal garbage  get it  the film is heavily influenced by larry clark  especially   kids   and   bully     but clark  s films    though also moralist and sexploitative    are high class masterworks compared to this crap  br    br   i don  t think there was ever such monomaniacal drive in a filmmaker to stick his ideas down the audience  s throat  stockler grabs us by the collar and tries to force his non stop moralist rant into our brains by repetition and exhaustion    you do get numb minded with so much babbling  yelling  inept direction  shaky camera and terrible acting going on  stockler doesn  t care a bit about technique  the quality of the images  framing  sound recording  soundtrack songs  dialog  sets  editing  etc is uniformly appalling   but he  s a narcissistic control freak  he anticipates the criticisms he  s bound to get by adding subtitles with smartie cutie comments  and by making the protagonists comment at one point how far fetched and phony it all is  i could relate to that    br    br   despite his megalomaniac ambitions  stockler seems incapable of giving us a minimum of visual or narrative structure    he can  t even decide if he wants gritty realism  hand held video camera etc  or stylization  repetition of scenes  use of alternate takes  etc   damn  he can  t even decide where to put his camera  there  s use of subjective camera for the three leads   the dialog features some of the most stupefyingly banal verbosity ever  the plot exists simply to justify the director  s profound hatred for his characters and what they stand for  all you see is a filmmaker being hateful  preachy  condemning  moralizing without the benefit of a minimum of talent  or technique  to go with it  br    br   it  s very disappointing to find caio blat in this mess  certainly one of the most promising young film actors in brazil  with his sleepy eyed puppy dog looks and emotional edge that often recall sal mineo  s  blat can be highly effective under good direction  as in   carandiru      lavoura arcaica      proibido proibir     here  he  s told to go over the top and he has to play with some of the most embarrassingly under equipped   actors   in recent memory  he also enters the risky realm of graphic sexploitation scenes  so goddawful they look rather like web cam porn   br    br   the film opens and ends with real interviews with   typical       middle class youth    stockler wants us to take those interviews as   proof   of what he  s trying to preach in fiction  but he blatantly despises and makes fun of his interviewees  selecting a highlight of abject  racist  sexist  stupid statements  which only shows assholes exist everywhere   stockler wants to prove that brazilian middle class youths are all present or future fascists because they  re middle class and enjoy recreational drugs  is he saying all neo fascists are on drugs   or that drugs potentialize fascist behavior   i couldn  t tell    br    br   with its dogmatic self righteousness  headache inducing technique and mind bending boredom    cama de gato   is bad for a       reasons but  above all  it  s harmful in a very insidious manner  it gives detractors of brazilian cinema a powerful case of argument    cama de gato   is best unwatched  unmentioned  buried and forgotten             an unforgettable masterpiece from the creator of the secret of nimh and the land before time  this was a very touching bittersweet cartoon  i remember this very well from my childhood  it was funny and sad and very beautiful  well it starts out a bit dark  a dog who escaped the pound  and gets killed by an old friend  ends up in heaven  and comes back  but it becomes sweet when he befriends an orphaned girl who can talk to animals  some scenes were a bit scary contrary to other cartoons  like the dream sequence of charlie  but everything else was okay and the songs were fair  a memorable role of burt reynolds and dom deluise  i just love that guy  ahehehe  and judith barsi of jaws the revenge  may god rest her soul  poor girl  she didn  t deserve to die  but she is in heaven now  all good people go to heaven  overall this is a very good animated movie  a don bluth classic enough to put anime and disney to shame  recommended for the whole family  and know this  if you have the original video of this  you  ll find after the movie  dom deluise has a very important and special message  gotta love that guy  ahehehe             this movie was a failure as a comedy and a film in general  it was a very slow paced movie that seemed to be trying to convey a message  but the message was a clich    hopeless mess to begin with  this movie falls on shameless environmental point  even making a self righteous point of destroying an suv and promoting animal planet  br    br   in sitting through this  i couldn  t help but notice that steve carell got no more than a single truly funny line  the only thing that could hypothetically mark this as a comedy is the pitiful attempt to give comic relief lines to wanda sykes  her character gets frequent  cringe worthy lines where they absolutely do not fit  br    br   far from the brilliance of bruce almighty  evan almighty blows its whole record breaking budget on special effect plot devices that turn out to barely advance the plot  the movie spends the first half building up to the construction of evan  s ark  but by the end  we learn that the ark was completely meaningless  and the whole plot was a just a vessel for the stupid gags and even stupider messages  the movie concludes when we learn that the whole ark  flood  and animal gathering was just a weak political statement by none other than god  yes  god was trying to influence politics             it is so gratifying to see one great piece of art converted into another without distortion or contrivance  i had no guess as to how such an extraordinary piece of literature could be recreated as a film worth seeing  if you loved bulgakov  s book you would be  understandably  afraid of seeing some misguided interpretation done more for the sake of an art film project than for actually bringing the story  s deeper meaning to the screen  there are a couple examples of this with the master and margarita  as complex and far fetched as the story is  the movie leaves out nothing  it is as if the filmmaker read bulgakov  s work the same way an orchestral conductor reads a score  with not a note missed  why can  t we find such talent here in the u s    so now my favorite book and movie have the same title             this movie is very violent  yet exciting with original dialog and cool characters  it has one of the most moving stories and is very true to life  the movie start off with action star leo fong as a down and out cop who is approaching the end of his career  when he stumbles on to a big case that involves corruption  black mail and murder  this is where the killings start  from start finish fong delivers in this must see action caper  this movie also co stars richard roundtree  br    br   i really enjoyed this film as a child but as i got older i realized that this film is pretty cheesy and not very good  i would not recommend this film and the action is very  very bad             the day has finally come for me to witness the perpetuation of azumi  s fate as an assassin  fruition of her character and the ultimate attempt to draw me deeper into the world she rampaged through so mercilessly during the first saga  br    br   that  s as poetical as i  ll get when talking about azumi    death or love  because when i cringed over the heavy sentimentality of house of flying daggers and complained about the credibility of aya ueto portraying a blood driven assassin  after watching azumi   i started to appreciate the previously mentioned shortcomings more than ever before  br    br   not only does the determination of each assassin feels sluggish and uninspiring but also many important elements are omitted from the entire experience  in azumi   we saw the assassins use various stealth tactics  which is their number one priority  as well as logic to make easy work of their marks with swift executions and quicker abilities to escape  but i won  t hold that against this movie too much since the story is slightly tweaked this time around and many more obstacles are planted in azumi  s way to prevent her from reaching the warlord and displaying any signs of charisma  by the way  chiaki is foolishly shelved for the most part of the film and is basically playing a toned down version of go go  minus the cool weapon and sense of menace  br    br   this brings me to the final blow which is the action  simply disguised in the title as the   death   side of the epic  in the first half of the film we see the debut of many promising adversaries with flashy looks and even flashier weapons  to no one  s surprise they meet their end one way or another but the film falls short when each of them start dying too fast and too easily  in azumi    the young assassins were mostly overpowering the opposition with quick but somewhat satisfying battles and the final showdown between azumi and bijomaru in comparison to the fights in azumi   was at least climaxed and worthwhile  some interesting effects were introduced but they were unable to achieve innovation due to the shortness of each encounter  i am in no way knocking down the conventional style of samurai films with their quick and realistic battles but characters in both azumi films were so imaginative and straight out of anime that the rules could have been broken and the action should have been further enriched  br    br   the romance side of azumi is there to fill in time between the fight scenes and unfortunately at the end it serves no purpose nor provides a much needed resolution  br    br   as a fan with an open mind for wide variety of movies and animation  i won  t lie and i  ll admit to my neutrality and unimpressiveness towards the first azumi film  but i  ll step right up and say that after watching azumi    the original was made to look like a flawless masterpiece  for what it  s worth  azumi    death or love could have gone straight to video  with its invisibly richer budget and a failed potential to add or even expand on the bumpy journey of desperate assassins  doing their best to restore the peace  with an unwavering courage to die trying             this has to be the worst piece of garbage i  ve seen in a while  br    br   heath ledger is a heartthrob  he looked deformed  i wish i  d known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent   of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him   br    br   orlando bloom is a heartthrob  with the scraggly beard and deer in the headlights look about him  i can  t say i agree  br    br   rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self  but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn  t wait to get off the set   br    br   i  m supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers  this is a far cry from butch cassidy  which actually was an entertaining film  this was trite  cliche ridden and boring  we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better  it didn  t  br    br   the last       minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious  heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel  and women and children are dying because of their presence  that  s not funny  but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on  because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail  i kept waiting for them to say   i  ll bite yer leg off    we were howling with laughter  as were several other warped members of the audience  when we left  pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was  br    br   i may not have paid cash to see this disaster  sneak preview   but it certainly wasn  t free  it cost me   hours of my life that i will never get back             a very ordinary made for tv product    tyson   attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect  fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing  and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes tyson even remotely interesting  a lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans             i  m sure deep in the recesses of jack blacks mind the character of nacho libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn  t  you can tell ol jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy  slimy mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department  br    br   i just sat there through most of the movie thinking   is this supposed to be funny   and   this is the guy from tenacious d right     the truth is this film has nothing to offer  at all  it  s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction  you  ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn  t  i was bored stupid about    minutes in but though it would surely pick up  it didn  t     minutes later i  d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful  br    br   it  s like  remember years ago when you  d see anything with your fave actor in it  even some of their really early pap from before they were famous  and you  d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop  yeah it  s like that  br    br   i  ve enjoyed some of jack black  s earlier movies like shallow hall and i  m really looking forward to seeing pick of destiny but come on man  if you do this to us again jack i  m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something  at the least give you a serious talking to  br    br   i know it  s a clich   but this is one of the worst movies i  ve ever seen and for so many reasons                i haven  t read the anne rice novel that this movie was based on  but who knows  maybe reading the book is cheaper than renting queen of the damned and is probably better for your health  it isn  t that this movie is necessarily bad for your health  but a book can be very relaxing and certainly exercises the active part of your brain more so than this movie  you can count the number of pages by anne rice that i  ve read on one hand  but after seeing this movie and interview with a vampire  i get the feeling that she writes really good novels  the plots for both movies hint at a whole sea of deep and interwoven vampire history  br    br   still  stuart townsend  s voice over narration gets a heck of a lot more annoying than brad pitt  s vampire narrative ever did  and you can tell that queen of the damned  s limited production resources barely give enough flesh to the anne rice storyline  while interview decided to go with lace and elegance  queen relies on low budget special effects that try really hard to be taken seriously  one can see that the original novel had potential as a movie and that the production team focused its attention in the wrong places  the costumes and rock   roll stage could have been replaced with more blood and an eerier soundtrack  br    br   however  i  ll give credit where credit is due  the soundtrack is excellent  korn and disturbed had me down with the sickness bobbing my noggin like butthead  br    br   the film opens with a very cool goth rock zoom   splice montage  but after the first ten minutes or so  the directing degenerates quickly  it  s as if the movie was so long that the director realized that there wasn  t enough time and enough money to do an anne rice novel justice  what results are some mediocre vampire scenes and plenty of cheesy special effects  unfortunately  queen of the damned fails to do the genre justice just as its john carpenter counterparts fail to impress  where are the yellow contacts  where  s the pale blue make up  scene after scene  i shook my head reminiscing about the days of salem  s lot and fright night when low budget was done right  br    br   there are redeeming qualities though that save this movie from being garbage  props to aaliyah  and may her soul forever rest in peace  she might have become a renowned actress  had her life not been taken from us so prematurely  for she did give this movie a decent performance with plenty of nice belly dancing  did i mention that the soundtrack was good  let  s see  what else can i say  it wasn  t too long  the anne rice novel could have easily been a three hour movie if an ambitious director like francis ford coppola got his hands on it  there are a few twists and turns here and there in the plot  but all in all it was a legitimate rock and roll addition to the slew of second rate vampire movies out there  the director of this movie went on to direct a new battlestar galactica mini series if that tells you anything  br    br   jy br    br   jimboduck dot com            while i count myself as a fan of the babylon   television series  the original movie that introduced the series was a weak start  although many of the elements that would later mature and become much more compelling in the series are there  the pace of the gathering is slow  the makeup somewhat inadequate  and the plot confusing  worse  the characterization in the premiere episode is poor  although the ratings chart shows that many fans are willing to overlook these problems  i remember the gathering almost turned me off off what soon grew into a spectacular series             leonard maltin gave this film a dreaded bomb rating in his      movie and video guide  what film was he looking at  kid vengeance or god  s gun are bombs  this film is a delight  it is fantastic  it is literate  it is well mounted  it is beautiful photographed  making a brilliant use of colors  right from the opening scene the film grabs your attention and tips you off that this film is a well done satire of the whole spaghetti western genre  the film is played for laughs from the beginning to the end with homages to douglas fairbanks     sunset strip  and the famous showdown in the good  the bad  and the ugly  edd byrnes  george hilton  and gilbert roland work brilliantly together to make the satire work  it is too bad mr  maltin rated this film so poorly as it is undeserved  one can only guess as to his reason  i suspect that he missed the point of the movie entirely and was expecting something more serious than this film is meant to be  kudos belong to everyone involved in this project  this film is a little gem waiting to be discovered by people who care about literate movies and appreciate satire             i don  t believe there has ever been a more evil or wicked television program to air in the united states as the     club  they are today  s equivalent to the ku klux klan of the   th century  their hatred of all that is good and sweet and human and pure is beyond all ability to understand  their daily constant attacks upon millions and millions of americans  as well as billions of humans the world over  who don  t happen to share their bigoted  cruel  monstrous  and utterly insane view of humanity is beyond anything television has ever seen  the lies they spout and the ridiculous lies they try to pass off as truth  such as the idea of   life after death   or   god   or   sin   or   the devil   is so preposterous that they actually seem mentally ill  so lost are they in their fantasy  sane people know that religion is a drug and shouldn  t let themselves get addicted to that type of fantasy  however  the     club is in a class by itself  they are truly a cult  while i believe in freedom of speech  they way they spread hatred  lies  disinformation  and such fantastic ideas is beyond all limits  i hope that one day the american psychiatric association will finally take up the study of those people who delude themselves in this way  people who let themselves sink so deeply into the fantasy land of religion that they no longer have any real concept of reality at all  treatment for such afflicted individuals is sorely needed in this country  as so many people have completely lost their minds to the fantasy of religion  the     club though  is even more horrible as it rises to the legal definition of   cult   but due to the     club  s vast wealth  conned daily from the millions of americans locked in their deceitful grip  they are above the law in this country  for those of you who have seen the movie   the matrix   you know that movie was a metaphor for religion on earth  the evil ones who are at the top of each of the religions who drain the ones they have trapped and cruelly abuse for their own selfish purposes  and those millions who are held in a death sleep and slowly being drained of their life force represent those many people who belong to religions and who have lost all ability to perceive what is really going on around them  br    br   in less civil times  the good townsfolk would have run such monsters as those associated with the     club out of town with torches and pitchforks  but in today  s world where people have lost all choice in their choices of television that is presented to them  we have no way to rid ourselves of the     club plague   br    br   the television ratings system and the   v   chip on tv  s should also have a rating called   r   for religion  so that rational people and concerned parents could easily screen such vile intellectual and brutal emotional rape  such as presented by the     club every day all over our country  from themselves and their children             if you wish to see shakespeare  s masterpiece in its entirety  i suggest you find this bbc version  indeed it is overlong at four and a half hours but jacoby  s performance as hamlet and patrick stewart  s as claudius are well worth the effort  br    br   it never ceases to amaze me how clear   hamlet   is when you see it in its length and order as set down by the bard  every film version of   hamlet   has tinkered with its structure  olivier concentrated on hamlet  s indecision  gibson on his passions  jacoby is able to pull all of these aspects of hamlet  s character together with the aid of shakespeare  s full script  br    br   why does hamlet not kill claudius immediately  hamlet says   i am very proud  revengeful  ambitious      hamlet is extremely upset  not only for his father  s death  and suspected murder   or his mother  s marriage to his uncle  but also  and mostly  because claudius has usurped the throne belonging to hamlet  he is furious at his mother for marrying claudius  marriages between royal kin is not unknown  done for political reasons  but that her marriage solidified claudius   claim to the throne before he could return from wittenburg to claim it for himself  he is  therefore  impotent to do anything about it  and this is true even after he hears his father  s ghost cry vengeance  he cannot simply kill the king or he will lose the throne in doing so  he must   out   the king  s secret and here is the tragedy  at the moment hamlet is successful in displaying claudius   guilt in public  he has opportunity to kill him and does not  why  he wants it all  he wants revenge  the throne and the damnation of claudius   soul in hell  hamlet overreaches himself in classic tragic form  his own hubris is his undoing  he kills polonius thinking it is claudius and the rest of the play spirals down to the final deaths of rosencrantz  guildenstern  ophelia  laertes  gertrude  claudius and hamlet himself             the golden door is the story of a sicilian family  s journey from the old world  italy  to the new world  america   salvatore  a middle aged man who hopes for a more fruitful life  persuades his family to leave their homeland behind in sicily  take the arduous journey across the raging seas  and inhabit a land whose rivers supposedly flow with milk  in short  they believe that by risking everything for the new world their dreams of prosperity will be fulfilled  the imagery of the new world is optimistic  clever and highly imaginative  silver coins rain from heaven upon salvatore as he anticipates how prosperous he  ll be in the new world  carrots and onions twice the size of human beings are shown being harvested to suggest wealth and health  and rivers of milk are swam in and flow through the minds of those who anticipate what the new world will yield  all of this imagery is surrealistically interwoven with the characters and helps nicely compliment the gritty realism that the story unfolds to the audience  the contrast between this imagery versus the dark reality of the sicilian people helps provide hope while they  re aboard the ship to the new world  br    br   the voyage to the new world is shot almost in complete darkness  especially when the seas tempests roar and nearly kill the people within  the dark reality i referred to is the old world and the journey itself to the new world  the old world is depicted as somewhat destitute and primitive  this is shown as salvatore scrambles together to sell what few possessions he has left  donkeys  goats and rabbits  in order to obtain the appropriate clothing he needs to enter the new world  i thought it was rather interesting that these people believed they had to conform to a certain dress code in order to be accepted in the new world  it was almost suggesting that people had to fit a particular stereotype or mold in order to be recognized as morally fit  the most powerful image in the film was when the ship is leaving their homeland and setting sail for the new world  this shot shows an overhead view of a crowd of people who slowly seem to separate from one another  depicting the separation between the old and new worlds  this shot also suggested that the people were being torn away from all that was once familiar  wanted to divorce from their previous dark living conditions and were desirous to enter a world that held more promise  br    br   as later contrasted to how the new world visually looks  the old world seems dark and bleak as compared to the bright yet foggy new world  i thought it was particularly interesting that the statue of liberty is never shown through the fog at ellis island  but is remained hidden  i think this was an intentional directing choice that seemed to negate the purpose of what the statue of liberty stands for    give me your poor  your tired  your hungry   seemed like a joke in regards to what these people had to go through when arriving at the new world  once they arrived in the americas  they had to go through rather humiliating tests  i e  delousing  mathematics  puzzles  etc   in order to prove themselves as fit for the new world  these tests completely changed the perspectives of the sicilian people  in particular  salvatore  s mother had the most difficult time subjecting herself to the rules and laws of the new world  feeling more violated than treated with respect  where their dreams once provided hope and optimism for what the new world would provide  the reality of what the new world required was disparaging and rude  salvatore doesn  t change much other than his attitude towards what he felt the new world would be like versus what the new world actually was seemed disappointing to him  this attitude was shared by mostly everyone who voyaged with him  their character arcs deal more with a cherished dream being greatly upset and a dark reality that had to be accepted  br    br   the film seems to make a strong commentary on preparing oneself to enter a heavenly and civilized society  cleanliness  marriage and intelligence are prerequisites  adhering to these rules is to prevent disease  immoral behavior and stupidity from dominating  perhaps this is a commentary on how america has learned from the failings of other nations and so was purposefully established to secure that these plagues did not infest and destruct  though the rules seemed rigid  they were there to protect and help the people flourish             nifty little episode played mainly for laughs  but with clever dollop of suspense  somehow a martian has snuck aboard a broken down bus on its way to nowhere  but which passenger is it   talk about your illegal immigrants    all star supporting cast  from wild eyed jack elam  hamming it up shamelessly   to sexy jean willes  if she  s the martian  then i say let  s open the borders    to cruel faced john hoyt  the most obvious suspect   along with familiar faces john archer and barney phillips  and a nice turn from bill kendis as the bus driver   makes for a very entertaining half hour even if the action is confined to a single set             i had before a feeling of mislike for all russian films  but  after seeing this film i haven  t  this is a unique masterpiece made by the best director ever lived in the ussr  he knows the art of film making  and can use it very well  if you find this movie  buy or copy it             i watched mask in the     s and it  s currently showing on fox kids in the uk  very late at night   i remember thinking that it was kinda cool back in the day and had a couple of the toys too but watching it now bores me to tears  i never realised before of how tedious and bland this cartoon show really was  it  s just plain awful  it is no where near in the same league as the transformers  he man or thundercats and was very quickly forgot by nearly everyone once it stopped being made  i only watch it on fox kids because ulysses    comes on straight after it  that  s if mask doesn  t put me to sleep first   one of the lesser     s cartoons that i hope to completely forget about again once it finishes airing on fox kids             phantasm     class  phantasm ii     awesome  phantasm iii     erm     terrible  br    br   even though i would love to stick up for this film  i quite simply can  t  the movie seems to have   sold out    first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start  something the others did not   also too many pointless characters  prime examples the kid  who is a crack shot  funny initially but soon you want him dead   the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls  erm not gonna work  or rather shouldn  t  and the blooming zombies  what the hell are they doing there  there no link to them in the other phatasms   also there is a severe lack of midgets running about  br    br   the only good bits are the cracking start and  of course  reggie b  br    br    possible spoiler coming up  br    br   to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main   in iv  br    br   overall very  very disappointing                    ludicrous  angelic   year old annakin turns into whiny brat    year old annakin  who somehow seems appealing to amidala    years his senior  now    year old jedi warrior hero annakin has a couple of bad dreams  and so takes to slaughtering children  his friends  and the entire framework of his existence because a crazy old man convinced him a  his precious wife might really die  and b  only he can prevent this  ludicrosity squared  br    br   i think the people who like this movie are not paying attention  the story is ridiculous  the characters are unbelievable  literally  not the perverted sense of   fantastic      wonderful    etc    br    br   obi wan kenobi was the wise and kind anchor for the entire series  but in the climax  he hacks off annakin  s legs  lets him burn in the lava  and leaves him to suffer  doesn  t anyone think that  s a little out of character  not to mention it was pretty stupid to take a chance on him living  as it turns out  br    br   i was expecting at least a story that showed consistent characters with plausible motivations  none of that here  the story could have been written by a    year old  br    br   oh yeah  the cgi is pretty cool             scotty  grant cramer  who would go on to star in the great b movie   killer klowns from outer space    agrees to help three middle aged guys learn how to   dialog   the ladies in this bad       s comedy  not bad as in       s lingo  which meant good  bad as in bad  with no likable characters  including  but not limited to  a kid who  s the freakiest looking guy since   friday the   th part       a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her  and the token fat slob  because after all what would an       s sex comedy be without a fat slob   well this one has two  this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of       s sex comedies  and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel  br    br   my grade d   br    br   eye candy  too numerous to count  you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point  think   bachlor party   but not as funny  and very disturbing  br    br   where i saw it  comcast moviepass            if you keep rigid historical perspective out of it  this film is actually quite entertaining  it  s got action  adventure and romance  and one of the premiere casting match ups of the era with errol flynn and olivia de havilland in the lead roles  as evident on this board  the picture doesn  t pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling  to get beyond that  one need only put aside the history book  and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction  i know  i know  that  s hard to do when you consider custer  s last stand at the little big horn and it  s prominence in the history of post civil war america  so i guess there  s an unresolved quandary with the picture  no matter how you look at it  br    br   there  s a lot to take in here though for the picture  s two hour plus run time  custer  s arrival at west point is probably the first head scratcher  riding up as he does in full military regalia  the practical joke by sharp  arthur kennedy  putting him up in the major  s headquarters probably should have gotten them both in trouble  br    br   ironically  a lot of scenes in this military film play for comedy  as in custer  s first meeting with libby bacon  and subsequent encounters that include tea reader callie  hattie mcdaniel   i hadn  t noticed it before in other films  but mcdaniel reminded me an awful lot of another favorite character actor of mine from the forties  mantan moreland  so much so that in one scene it looked like it might have been moreland hamming it up in a dress  with that in mind  the owl scene was a hoot too  br    br   as for flynn  it  s interesting to note that a year earlier  he portrayed j e b  stuart opposite ronald reagan  s depiction of general custer in   santa fe trail    both vying for the attention of none other than olivia de havilland  in that film  reagan put none of the arrogance and flamboyance into the character of custer that history remembers  while in flynn  s portrayal here it  s more than evident  but it doesn  t come close to that of richard mulligan  s take on the military hero in       s   little big man    let  s just say that one was a bit over the top  br    br   the better take away the picture had for me was the manner in which custer persevered to maintain his good name and not gamble it away on a risky business venture  that and his loyalty to the men he led in battle along with the discipline he developed over the course of the story  most poignant was that final confrontation with arch rival sharp just before riding into the little big horn  in which he declared that hell or glory was entirely dependent on one  s point of view  earlier  a similar remark might have given us the best insight of all into custer  s character  when he stated     you take glory with you when it  s your time to go               the film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction  the first really bad thing is the guy hijacking steven seagal would have been beaten to pulp by seagal  s driving  but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the movie  br    br   it seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot  so just plan to enjoy the action  and do not expect a coherent plot  turn any sense of logic you may have  it will reduce your chance of getting a headache  br    br   i does give me some hope that steven seagal is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies             interesting and short television movie describes some of the machinations surrounding jay leno  s replacing carson as host of the tonight show  film is currently very topical given the public drama surrounding conan o  brien and jay leno  br    br   the film does a good job of sparking viewers   interest in the events and showing some of the concerns of the stakeholders  particularly of the nbc executives  the portrayal of ovitz was particularly compelling and interesting  i thought  br    br   still  many of the characters were only very briefly limned or touched upon  and some of the acting seemed perfunctory  nevertheless  an interesting story             any film about wwii made during wwii by a british production company has no latter day peer in my opinion  respectfully  the confluence of so many things near and dear to my heart are in at dawn we dive  as a descendant of admiral horatio nelson and student of all aspects of world war two and particularly naval warfare  i favor depictions of subs and action in the north atlantic and especially those which include the german side of things  for those unacquainted with target priorities  an attack on an enemy warship is the greatest event that a submarine can hope to encounter and such a rare opportunity would develop surprisingly similarly to what we see here  the pacing is deliberate and typical of the works coming out of the ealing  rank and british gaumont studios back in the day  frankly i prefer its quieter  more cerebral approach for its humanity and realism that engages far better than any over produced hollywood movie ever could  this reminds me of powell and pressburger  s the   th parallel thanks to the powerfully persuasive eric portman  a favorite of mine  john mills receives second billing and a smaller font in the titles  so this is clearly meant to be mr  portman  s film but the whole cast shines  as for the title sequence  am i the only one who is utterly charmed by gainsborough production  s lovely pre cgi gainsborough girl             a brilliant horror film  utterly gruesome and very scary too  the thing is a remake from john carpenter  but please  do not let that put you off this film  it is simply brilliant  the start of the film has the alien  s spacecraft hurtling towards the earth centuries before mankind walked the planet with an explosion that unleashes the film  s title in amazing shining white and blue stating   the thing    one of the best opening credits for a horror film ever  br    br   the cast of actors who play the twelve man science team are a joy to behold and the locations for the setting of their station in antartica is visually impressive on dvd widescreen  it must have been great in the cinema  i regret not seeing this on the big screen  br    br   kurt russell is excellent as macready  the helicopter pilot who reluctantly becomes the leader of the men trying to combat a lethal shape changing monstrosity that has infiltrated their base  all the actors in this are really good and create terrific scenes of paranoia and tension as to who the thing has infected  my favourite scene in the whole film has to be when macready tests everyone thats still alive for infection  it is tense  scary and finally spectacular  i love it because its funny as well  br    br   special mention must go to rob bottin for his truly amazing make up effects and shape changing designs of the alien itself  if he didn  t get an oscar for best visual effects at the time then he damn well should have  this is also debatable as to whether this is john carpenter  s greatest film   its certainly a gruesome masterpiece  br    br   wait for a cold winter night  get some budweiser from the fridge  sit down and watch the thing  a horror masterpiece of flame throwing heroes fighting shape changing towers of gore and slime  br    br   utterly brilliant  br    br   ten out of ten             i absolutely love this film  everything about it  it almost felt like watching me and my friends on screen  the way this movie was filmed was a pure masterpiece  very original and creative  i related to these characters and even had the same thoughts as some  i  m really glad i ran across this movie  if only there were more genius   like justin out there             no one can say i wasn  t warned as i have read the reviews  both user   external   but like most of us attracted to horror movies    curiosity got this cat   come on  we all scream at the people in the movie not to go into the dark room  but you know that  s horror aficionados are always dying to know what  s in there even if we know it  ll be bad   br    br   the bottom line is that this movie left me angry  not because it pretends to be real  who cares   gimmicks are allowed   or because the actors and dialogue are so lame  is this an unusual event in horror movies   or even because the movie is so bad  and i am being polite here   what really got me mad is that the film is not only a rip off of bwp  but also a half hearted lazy rip off at that  br    br   i don  t believe in sacred cows and if they thought they could outdo bwp then kudos to them  but they didn  t even try  the movie was made with little effort or care and that is the most unforgivable sin in horror  or any  movie             a new way to enjoy goldsworthy  s work  rivers and tides allows fans to see his work in motion  watching goldsworthy build his pieces  one develops an appreciation for every stone  leaf  and thorn that he uses  goldsworthy describes how the flow of life  the rivers  and the tides inspires and affects his work  although  i was happy the film covered the majority of goldsworthy  s pieces  no snowballs   i do feel it was a bit long  the film makers did a wonderful job of bringing goldsworthy  s work to life  and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch             if you liked william hickey in   prizzi  s honor    he resurrects his character  as don anthony in   mob boss    this is a very weak   godfather   satire with few laughs  stuart whitman looks perplexed as to what he  s doing in this schlock fest  morgan fairchild  s performance is one of the better efforts in the movie  and that alone is not a good sign for sure  eddie deezen vacillates between   three stooges   slapstick and a bad woody allen imitation  fatally flawed    mob boss   is so derivative that boredom quickly overcomes comedy and the film drags on with car chases  hidden weapons in a restaurant bathroom  and numerous other nonsense    merk            i have seen most  if not all of the laurel   hardy classic films  i have always enjoyed there comical stupidly  even after watching it over and over again  this new film attempts to bring back the classic with two new actors who resemble both laurel   hardy  however fails miserably for various reasons  one of which is how out of place their cloths are  still early   th century  however are both portrayed in the     s setting  some of the former dialogue was brought back  however it also fails miserably to come close to the classic series  this film could very well be the worst film i have ever seen and should be pulled off the shelf and locked away forever  the real laurel   hardy are surly spinning in their graves at such a bad imitation             i just started watching the show around july  i found it by mistake  i was channel surfing during a vacation  it is a great show  i just wish it wasn  t on so late at night  it  s on at       am  as a working person it makes it hard to watch all the time  br    br   i read some comments  i did not agree with the late one about not growing up in the     s and not believing that this stuff can happen  br    br   i grew up in the     s  i  m hispanic and i had a   white   boyfriend plus we had black friends in high school  i believe people get along because of their interests and personalities and it has nothing to do with being a certain race or color  br    br   i can  t wait till the show goes on dvd so i can buy it  this way i can see it from the beginning             this film is well cast  often silly and always funny  lemmon and matthau work their tag team magic to perfection  brent spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director  from the first   hare krishna   to the last   you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs    i thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy            i have just given a    for thieves highway  i mention this for two reasons one to prove i  m not a git who only gives bad reviews but   because the theme of the film has the same thread namely the falling in love with a woman of the night  br    br   we all know pretty woman is a chick flick but you can  t avoid them all  they  ll eventually get you  pretty woman for me does two things  two terrible horrible ghastly things  firstly it portrays prostitution as a career more akin to that of a dancer  you know with absolutely great friends  leg warmers lots of giggling  borrowing each others make up  you see in the reality of pretty woman the prostitute and this is a street walker prostitute we  re talking about here  has a great life  she  s healthy happy with only the occasional whimper to explain her predicament  my feeling is this   happy hooker   type protagonist is a lot more palatable than an even nearly realistic character  which for me begs the question if you make a movie about a type of person but are too chicken scared to adorn that player with the characteristics familiar to that role then why do it  if i make a film about a chef but don  t want him to cook or talk about food or wear a white hat then why make a film about a chef in the first place  by bailing out and turning the hooker into a respectable dancer type the story misses the point completely and consequently never indulges in any of the moral or social questions that it could have  what a cop out  really really lame   br    br   secondly    pretty woman   insults romance itself  edward lewis played by richard gere has no clue how to seduce or romance this   lady   that is without his plastic friend  yep don  t leave home without it  especially if you are a moron in a suit who has no imagination    out of    of his romantic moments involve splashing cash in one way or another  even when he first meets her it  s the lotus esprit turbo that does all the work  necklaces here diamonds there limos over there  money money money  where  s the charm  where  s the charisma  don  t mention that attempt at the piano please  br    br   girls who like this film will also be girls who like shopping more than most  guys who like this film will not even have realized that old eddy has less charm than a calculator  as they probably don  t either so it wont have registered  more importantly anyone who likes this film will hate   thieves highway   a wonderful story of which part is based on the same subject  br    br   i  ll finish on a song  br    br   pretty woman hangin round the street pretty woman  the kind i like to treat pretty woman  i don  t believe you you  re not the truth no one could spend as much as you mercy br    br   pretty woman  wont you pardon me pretty woman  i couldn  t help but see pretty woman  and you look lovely as can be do you lack imagination just like me br    br   pretty woman  shop a while pretty woman  talk a while pretty woman  sell your smile to me pretty woman  yeah  yeah  yeah pretty woman  look my way pretty woman  say you  ll stay with me  and i  ll pay you  i  ll treat you right            this movie was terrible  the plot was terrible and unbelievable  i cannot recommend this movie  where did this movie come from  this movie was not funny and wasted the talent of some great actors and actresses including  gary sinise  kathy bates  joey lauren adams  and jennifer tilly             i strongly dislike this show  i mean  like  basically everyone at that school is perfect  and rich  and i doubt a boarding school would look as cool as that  and why do they suddenly allow girls into the school  isn  t that just a little weird  anyways  jamie lynn spears cannot act  she always has the same facial expression  which really annoys me  she is basically emotionless  and all the guys seem to like her  br    br   and shouldn  t chase tell her he likes her  its not that hard  really  none of this show is real life  and she isn  t   a girl like me   because majority of the regular girls do not go to boarding school  do not have designer clothes  and do not live by the beach  br    br   fake fake fake             normally i don  t like series at all  they  re all to predictable and they tend to become boring and dull very fast  br    br   these series however  are well played  the story follows through all episodes and even if you miss one  the story will still be catching your mind  br    br   the episodes are all filmed on a hospital and takes you further and further in to the mysteries of dark and old secrets that lies just beneath the surface of the mighty hospital             holy sh t this was god awful  i sat in the theater for for an hour and ten minutes and i thought i was going to gouge out my eyes much in the manor oedipus rex  dear god  this movie deserves no more credit than anything done by a middle school film buff  please save your money  this movie can offer you nothing  unless you enjoy sideshows and sleeping in movie theaters  you know  h ll  bring your girlfriend and make things interesting  you will be the only ones there anyway  f ck this slide show   br    br   ye be warned  br    br   i recommend not watching this  br    br   hello  br    br   how are you  br    br   i  m pretty good  br    br   enjoying this day  br    br   i am  br    br   this comment was one hundred times more fun than pretending to watch this daym movie  this is sad             this movie is without a doubt a perfect         for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no   good plot   or anything like that  thats ridiculous  saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot  you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes  for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that  if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan  s movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time  porn is watched for the porn  jackie chan is watched for the action  i think you people are rating it bad because there  s no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained  sure the middle of the movie was boring  very boring  but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that  this did change the way how american action movies were created  they have even stollen scenes from this movie  if you want a true man  a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan  s  hes pure in everyway  he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park  and even in todays movies  american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more  police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do  a masterpiece            i saw this at the london film festival last night  apparently the shorter version  james mcnally  s summary of the content of the film is very good  nossiter very deftly blends his investigation of the wine business into wider concerns about globalisation  homogenisation  the effect of the mass media  the power of capital and the need for diversity  br    br   the film is shot on hand held dv which some might find offputting  but which does enable nossiter to catch people off guard on a number of occasions which probably would not have been possible using more conventional equipment  br    br   despite the sprawling feel of the film  the editing is very sharp  not only giving us a parade of the world  s dogs  but also undercutting a number of interviewees   comments with somewhat contradictory visual images  and giving others sufficient rope to hang themselves  to a degree this evoked michael moore  s recent work  although nossiter operates in a more subtle way   but probably the roots of the film go back to marcel ophuls     the sorrow and the pity    both in the way the film is constructed and in the emergence of   salt of the earth   french peasants as the stars  de montille pere et fils were present at the lff screening and answered questions afterwards  we do indeed all need a little disorder   bravo hubert  br    br   overall an excellent film with implications that go way beyond the world of wine into the way we construct ourselves as people  and organise our world             i can  t believe this movie managed to get such a relatively high rating of    it is barely watchable and unbelievably boring  certainly one of the worst films i have seen in a long  long time  br    br   in a no budget way  it reminded me of star wars episodes i and ii for the sheer impression that you are watching a total creative train wreck  br    br   this film should be avoided at all costs  it  s one of those   festival films   that only please the pseudo intellectuals because they are so badly made those people think it makes it   different    therefore good  br    br   bad film making is not   different    it  s just bad film making             this movie really woke me up  like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber  br    br   this guy john  ben chaplin  leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town  until the stunningly gorgeous  wild  girl to die for nadia  nicole kidman   ordered by email from russia  enters his life to become his beloved wife  by johns plan  however a glitch turns up   nadia does not speak a word of johns language  although calm and emotionless on the outside  john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service  he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process  br    br   what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure  giving the viewer a subliminal message   you would have probably acted likewise    br    br   kidman  cassel   kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing    almost   only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues  however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right  nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles  at least from the cultural background  br    br   the pace of the film is fast and captivating  and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear  you rather feel that you  re in the middle of the plot  and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out  br    br   my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy  to sum it up  it has an unusual plot  great acting  and ideas below the surface  like the idea of the   rude awakening   from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society  s machine  the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings    welcome to the machine      i bet that in the end  john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all  br    br   thank you  writers  for the great story  and everyone else for this great movie  please make a sequel  and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever  because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the         percent of the potential viewers  i am sure of it             ed wood rides again  the fact that this movie was made should give any young br    br   aspiring film maker hope  any screenplay you might have thought of using to br    br   line a litterbox or a birdcage should now not seem that bad  do not watch this movie unless you have a healthy stash of tylenol or rolaids  watching this br    br   movie made me realize that boa vs  python was not that bad after all  it probably would have been better to do this movie in claymation as at least that way no actor would have had to take credit for being in this film  it is understandable why this director has so many aliases  there is a bright side to watching this movie in that if you can get someone to bring you a bag of chips  then you can eat your way out of the cocoon of cheese that surrounds you enabling you to br    br   make your toward your tv set  s cocoon of cheese that surrounds it             this sports a nice  deep cast but for a thriller you better deliver more than name actors and talk  the first third of this movie was nothing but talk  and more talk  most of that was a bunch of women bitching about everything to each other   br    br   the first five listed actors in here are women so that verifies that it  s really a   chick flick   and little else  this probably plays on the lifetime network  br    br   there was a quick murder scene and then more talk  by halfway through  they had lost me   br    br   by the way  sally field looked about    years old in here             i think this movie has got it all  it has really cool music that i can never get out of my head  it has cool looking characters  is really funny you know  the kind that you  ll crack up on the ground and you  ll keep saying the funny parts over every day for three weeks  despite the bad acting  bad cgi  and bad story about cops going after a robot   its really cool  its one of those movies you and all of your family can watch  get together  eat pizza  laugh like crazy  and watch it two more times  br    br   there are so many funny parts  like when kurt was trying to get edison  s attention and gave him the finger  and then threw a paint ball gun at him so they could play paint ball  on that part  i kept saying   remember  remember   to my cousins who saw it and showed them what happened  there was also a really funny part when edision ran into the room and kurt was there just before they fought  and kurt was talking about his   strange dream   and how he was   superman    i loved that part  although it has been a while since i saw it  so i don  t remember that part  everything the actors said were funny  like how kurt says    i worship you  like a god    to the robot  br    br   although there was some bad things  in all it was a great movie  man  i can  t stop laughing  i wish i had that movie                howard  kevin kline  teaches english at the high school in a small indiana city  he is finally getting married to emily  joan cusack   much to his parents delight  the town is abuzz  too  because one of its own  cameron  matt dillon  has been nominated for an acting oscar  everyone  including howard and emily  is watching the academy awards on television as cameron is declared the winner  in his acceptance speech  cameron announces that he was able to fulfill his role as a gay military man  in part  because of lessons he learned from a gay teacher he had in high school  you guessed it  its howard  but  howard has never   come out    in fact  he believes he is straight  with the whole town  and members of the media  waiting and observing the happenings  will howard and emily go ahead and get married  or  is howard truly gay and realize he can not go through with the ceremony  this is a wonderful  funny  and humane film about a gay man and his situation  as the man who did not realize he was gay  kline is excellent and touching  the rest of the cast is equally fine  with cusack a stitch as the mixed up fianc   and dillon  bob newhart  debbie reynolds  tom selleck  and others on hand to delight the audience as well  the costumes are very nice and the setting in the lovely indiana heartland is beautiful  then  too  the script  the direction  and the production are very  very nice  but  the insightful  humorous  and the thoughtful look at the gay population is the film  s best asset  no doubt  for those who would be offended by a gay themed film  yes  just skip over this one  but  for everyone who wants to laugh heartily  and gain a better understanding of the gay situation at the same time  this is definitely the best film out there             when the opening shot is u s  marines seriously disrespecting the u s  flag  a movie has a tough road ahead  but unfortunately it was downhill from there  there is a military adviser credited  who is also apparently a retired u s  marine  making it even more baffling that this incredible breach of protocol  and law  went unnoticed  even more baffling is the way they simply glossed over how a marine is reported kia  then buried  in very short order  without the slightest explanation of how they identified the body  or if there even was a body  the u s  government is still finding the missing from wwii  and it takes months to identify the remains  military shot down remain mia for months or years and are only declared kia when the remains have been positively identified  or after years of red tape  here we are expected to believe that it happens within a matter of days or weeks  maybe this happens in denmark  but not in the u s  clearly none of the people involved ever had the slightest involvement with  or respect for  the u s  military  br    br   beyond that  there are a number of other utterly laughable moments when characters come up with zingers out of nowhere  there must have been some really extended meetings between auteur and actors as they struggled to find their motivation for such hogwash  having a script that worked might have helped  but this one seems to have been made up on the spot  working from cliffs notes  there  s no way to know if the script was this awful originally  or if it was the auteur  or the middle management kids at the studio who bear responsibility  either way  this is an awful movie that should have never been made             we usually think of the british as the experts at rendering great adventure from the imperial age  with the likes of the four feathers        and zulu  simply because the imperial age was  for the most part  british  here  in the wind and the lion  we see a wonderful rendering of america  s own imperial age  br    br   america  s projection of power under teddy roosevelt is the backdrop for this conventional tale of the kidnapped damsel who  despite her gentility  is smitten by the rough  manly nobility of her captor  who in turn is disarmed by her beauty and scorn   politically correct prigs eager to see some slight of   native   peoples or cultures can rest assured  that the way arabs and muslims are depicted here is far more flattering than the way their modern counterparts depict themselves on the current world stage   what makes this story different are the terrific production values   faultless photography  composition and editing   the terrific casting   the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy   and vivid history  br    br   though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son  every member of the family can identify with one of the characters  whether it be sean connery  s noble brigand  candace bergen  s feisty heroine  john huston  s wily john hay or steve kanaly  s spiffy  radiant  ruthless can do lieutenant  roosevelt  s   big stick    there is a transcendent scene at the end  when the little boy is symbolically swept away by the dashing moor on his white steed  this is high adventure at its best             i had been looking forward to seeing dreamgirls for quite a while   what with all it  s raving reviews  nominations and media attention  and i must say  the first quarter of the movie was good  it really portrayed the black music scene back then  however  as the movie wore on  me and my whole family were bored out of our wits  the singing just kept coming  one after the other  i mean seriously  just one more music number and it would have broke even with rent  br    br   furthermore  i noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters  i just didn  t care what happened to them  even when eddie murphy  s character died of a drug overdose  i knew i should have been sad  but i just couldn  t feel any emotion for that character  the characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot  but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me in  br    br   finally  the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care  which goes along with the lack of character development  this movie reminded me of a copy cat movie based on ray  chicago  and rent  ray and chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion   overall i think this movie would best suit someone who doesn  t really care about an overall story  yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances             one of starewicz  s longest and strangest short films follows a toy dog in search of an orange after becoming animated by the tear of the mother of a girl who longs for an orange  the dog comes upon an orange after falling out of the back of a car on his way to be sold  but at night must protect the orange when he comes enters a devilish nightclub featuring many bizarre and scary characters  with the help of a stuffed cat  the dog gets the orange back to the little girl and she is saved from a terrible scurvy death  the mascot features new techniques i have not yet seen in starewicz  s films  the addition of sync sound and a mixture of live action with the stop motion animation makes for a new twist on starewicz  s old style of puppetry  live scenes of moving cars and people  s feet walking by as a puppet sits on the concrete sidewalk is impressive and fresh  the honking of cars and cries of street vendors is noteworthy due to the fact that small studio shifts to sound were costly and starewicz  s utilization of the new technology seems like old hat  new puppet characters in this film are frightening contributions to the devil  s club scene  twigss and newspaper shreds come to life  skeletons of dead birds lay eggs which hatch skeleton chicks  characters come flying in from all over on pats and pans and rocking horses  a new editing technique uses quick zooms which are accomplished through editing to speed up the pace of what before might have been a slow scene  overall  starewicz is able to update his style of film making to meet the demands of a new audience making this film one of the best examples of his work             nice character development in a pretty cool milieu  being a male  i  m probably not qualified to totally understand it  but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive victorian environment from the start  it isn  t as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher  what makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters  each has their own   thing   that they contend with  once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs  they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion  what i enjoyed about this movie is that it didn  t go for cheap comedy when it could have  it didn  t try to pound a lesson into us  the people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light  i did have a little trouble with the alfred molina character having such an epiphany so quickly  but  within this world  it needed to happen  good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people             prussic gas  a murderer donning a red clansman suit and hood wielding a white whip  and the murders of college school girls at the hands of paid convicts enlisted by a mysterious mastermind who keeps his face hidden within an office containing aquariums of turtles and fish  the inspectors at scotland yard  higgins ijoachim fuchsberger and his superior sir john siegfried sch  renberg certainly have their hands full with this case  it all seems to center around student ann portland uschi glas   who  when she turns     is to inherit a great deal of wealth  the girls who are targeted share a room with ann  but the reason for their murders remains a mystery sy  s finest must figure out  the staff of the girls   dormitory all seem to be hiding something and certain members of the faculty are falling prey to the killer in the red monk robe disguise  talented enough to precisely strangle the necks of those attacked with the whip  two prisoners are commissioned by a mystery man to use the newly created toxic gas created by a scientist murdered at the beginning of the film during what was supposed to be a monetary exchange for his creation  it  s a clever scheme where a driver  greaves g  nter meisner meets the convicts   who hide in a barrel who are assisted by a corrupt prison guard  taken blindfolded to the secret room of the mastermind  he gives them orders on who to kill and how  uncovering this operation is a top priority for higgins and sir john for it will lead them to the truth they seek in regards to the murders and why they are happening  under suspicion are girls   dormitory headmistress  her author brother  a sweaty  incredibly nervous chemistry teacher  a snooping gardener  and the bannister  some are red herrings until they are disposed of  throwing the viewer for a loop each time until the real mastermind is discovered  the ending features multiple twists   br    br   out of the krimi films i  ve seen  the college girl murders is the closest to a giallo with it  s colorful killer  a convoluted plot yielding lots of surprises and potential suspects    sordid shenanigans between adults and the college girls at the dormitory  i think you can also see the influence of james bond on this particular krimi film with the villain mastermind  s secret hideout with an alligator pit   which isn  t used   the fake bible water pistol  when opened  fires the gas into the face of startled victims  the greaves   royles royce which has latches that cause flaps to darken the windows without revealing the passenger in the back seat  and the peep holes used to spy on the girls in their rooms and while swimming  many might consider sir john a liability due to his bumbling  buffoonish behavior and how he often undermines higgins   abilities to get at the truth   perhaps poking fun at know it all british inspectors who harm a case more than solve it   i felt he was used as comedy relief  particularly with his attempts at psychoanalyzing suspects and potential victims  often misunderstanding what are told to him  higgins  using the skills adopted over his years as an investigator  instead follows the clues facts  often avoiding sir john as much as possible  capable direction by the reliable alfred vohrer who keeps the pace humming at a nice speed  and the screenplay is full of interesting characters and lurid content  the fact that so many of the adults surrounding the dormitory are suspect  any of them might be the one wielding the whip or calling the shots behind those murdered girls   executions  i  d say this may be one of the best   if not the best examples of the krimi genre  for it keeps you guessing  always one more ace up it  s sleeve  the revelations unearthed at the very end are quite eye opening   and  you even get a literal unmasking of the real mastermind pulling the strings to top it all off              i was very lucky to see this film as part of the melbourne international film festival      only a few days ago  i must admit that i am very partial to movies that focus on human relations and especially the ones which concentrate on the tragic side of life  i also love the majority of scandinavian cinematic offerings  there is often a particular deep quality in the way the story unfolds and the characters are drawn  character building in this film is extraordinary in its details and its depth  this is despite the fact that we do encounter quite a number of characters all with very particular personal situations and locations within their community  the audience at the end of the screening was very silent and pensive  i am still playing some of those scenes in my mind and i am still amazed at their power and meaningfulness            this movie is really bad  most of it looks like it was filmed either in a park or a basement  there s a giant spider but all we see of it is one leg  there are some worms that live in a cave that are just cheap sock puppets with cardboard teeth  and the plot is a bunch of post apocalyptic mumbo jumbo that makes no sense at all  the whole thing is just laughable            i think this is one hell of a movie           we can see steven fighting around with his martial art stuff again and like in all segal movies there  s a message in it  without the message it would be one of many action fighting movies but the message is what makes segal movies great and special             i saw this movie in the theater  and was thoroughly impressed by it  then again  that was when claire danes was a good actress  not the foolish  arrogant  hollywood ized bitch she is today  anyway  this film really struck me as one of the more raw  realistic  beautiful friendship films  how far would you really go for your best friend  i was moved to tears at the end  and still tear up when i watch it now  i own it   i remember as soon as i left the theater  i called my best friend and sobbed to her how much i loved her  this is a great film to watch with your best girlfriend  however be prepared for the almost certain conversation afterward where she turns to you and asks if you  d do something like that for her                i  ve seen this film literally over     times   it  s absolutely jam packed with entertainment    powers boothe gives a stellar performance  as a fan of actors such as william shatner  impulse        and ron liebmann  up the academy       i never thought an actor could capture the   intensity   like shatner and liebmann in those roles  until i saw boothe as jim jones  as far as i  m concerned  powers boothe is jim jones   this film captures his best performance               the three main characters are all hopeless  and yet you only feel sorry for one of them  ernesto  hopelessly devoted to mercedes  this was part of the frustration  screaming at mercedes to get a clue and ditch the no good harry  to no avail  br    br   then there  s the satisfaction  steve buscemi has a great part as a transvestite  and harvey keitel  s moving story of his indignity playing a gorilla for a cheap tv movie is incredible  when you least expect it  quentin tarintino is doing half a monologue  and anthony quinn turns ernesto into a wealthy man  br    br   time and again great moments appear in the story  but in the end it  s hard to know what to feel about this movie  it doesn  t have a happy ending  or even a complete one  but it somehow feels right  br    br   this movie is strange  but then so am i  no wonder i liked it             reese witherspoon first outing on the big screen was a memorable one  she appears like a fresh scrubbed face   tween   slight and stringy  but undeniably reese  br    br   i have always liked her as an actor  and had no idea she started this young with her career  go figure  i actually gained some respect for reese to know who she was so early on  i say that because whenever i have watched her perform  the characters thus far  in each portrayal she also seemed to have her own persona that lived with that character  quite nicely in fact  br    br   anyway  my first film experience with reese was the little red riding hood parody reese did with kiefer sutherland  somehow i assumed that was her first time up   at bat   not so  well done reese           this game ranks above all so far  i had the honor of playing mine on ps  so the graphics were really good  the voice acting was above standard  the difficulty level is just right  wesker has to be the best characters in the re series in my opinion  the story amazed me and took many different twist that i wasn t expecting  the only rating this game deserves is great            this movie is not worth anything  i mean  if you want to watch this kind of stuff  flip to hollywood movies  this totally is a disgrace to the bollywood name  neal n nikki seriously sucked  never watch this movie  as for the actors  it appears the acting genes skipped a generation  tanisha couldn  t have worn less and uday chopra obviously was just picked because he was the director  s spoiled son   all of that halla re was amazingly stupid  the songs are eh  and i hope the director did not spend to much money on it       bottom line  i hated the movie  do not let your kids watch it  and if you have it in your house it is a stupid movie so discard it  buy the cd  if you must   as i said  the songs are eh   at least it is better then the movie             this is yet another western about a greedy cattle baron looking to push out small ranchers and farmers  it  s certainly all been done before and since  but the violent men is something special  br    br   what makes it special is barbara stanwyck playing the role of vixen as she often did in her later films  she  s married to the crippled edward g  robinson who  s the cattle baron here  but robinson is crippled and there is some hint that his injuries may have left him impotent  no matter to barbara  whose needs are being met by her brother in law brian keith  that doesn  t sit well with either dianne foster who is robinson and stanwyck  s daughter  nor with lita milan who is keith  s mexican girl friend  br    br   the infidelity subplot almost takes over the film  but glenn ford as the stalwart small rancher who is a civil war veteran come west for his health manages to hold his own here  he  s every inch the quiet western hero who people make the mistake of pushing once too often  i almost expect those famous words from wild bill elliott to come out of ford  s mouth    i  m a peaceable man    would have been very applicable in the vioilent men  br    br   the fifties was the age of the adult western  themes were entering into horse operas that hadn  t been explored before  the following year glenn ford would do another western  jubal  one of his best which also explores infidelity as a plot component  br    br   there  s enough traditional western stuff in the violent men and plenty for those who are addicted to soap operas as well             apparently  the mutilation man is about a guy who wanders the land performing shows of self mutilation as a way of coping with his abusive childhood  i use the word   apparently   because without listening to a director andy copp  s commentary  which i didn  t have available to me  or reading up on the film prior to watching  viewers won  t have a clue what it is about  br    br   gorehounds and fans of extreme movies may be lured into watching the mutilation man with the promise of some harsh scenes of splatter and unsettling real life footage  but unless they  re also fond of pretentious  headache inducing  experimental art house cinema  they  ll find this one a real chore to sit through  br    br      minutes of ugly imagery accompanied by dis chordant sound  terrible music and incomprehensible dialogue  this mind numbingly awful drivel is the perfect way to test one  s sanity  if you  ve still got all your marbles  you  ll switch this rubbish off and watch something decent instead  i watched the whole thing  but am well aware that i  m completely barking               this movie was absolutely pathetic  a pitiful screenplay and lack of any story just left me watching three losers drool over bikini babes  at times i felt like i was watching an episode of beavis and butthead  i couldn  t even sit through the whole movie  emran hashmi disappoints  and hrshitta bhatt is not impressive at all  celina jaitley was not bad  the only worthwhile part of the film is the spoof on anu malik and his obsession of shayaris  it was pretty hilarious  the songs   sini ne   and its remix version were really good  you can always count on emran lip locking and lip synching a chartbuster  all in all  it seems emran doesn  t have a good script from the bhatts to back him up this time             i feel the niiiiiight heat  i feel your heeaaaaaaaaaart beat  something ain  t right    theme song written by b j  cook from skylark  david foster  s old band and wife  she also wrote the memorable theme from cbc  s   airwaves    oh night heat  what a program  well written  well acted and totally classic  crime solvers and a good team and a dash of humour at the end  i  d like to think this is really what detectives do did  giambone was a real favourite  on a canadian tip  i learned every canadian actor  s name and style from guest spots done on night heat  everyone passed through the night heat set and like law   order  it was story driven so you could just watch and enjoy without a lot of character melodrama             this movie fails miserably on every level  i have an idea  let  s take everyone involved in this movie and ship them into a hot zone in the middle east  maybe if we  re lucky they  ll all be shot and killed and we won  t have to ever have our time wasted by them again  did i mention that i have never been so bitter about a cinematic pile of crap in my entire life  my god  i can  t think of anything i  ve ever seen that was this bad  i  d rather watch ishtar    times in a row than sit through    minutes of this sorry excuse for a film  if i ever happen to meet anyone who was involved in this film  i  ll spit in their face and then beat them senseless  that  s my two cents             yes i  ll say before i start commenting  this movie is incredibly underrated  br    br   sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass  he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star  glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind  br    br   the acting was good  apart from thewlis  br    br   stone really has a talent with this role  she  s slick  naughty and seductive and doesn  t look a day older than she did in the first she really impressed me like in casino   morrisey was also good  he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it  thewlis however was lame  he ruined his character and was over the top the whole way  he really sucked  br    br   overall  this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch  just ignore thewlis             based on a edgar rice burroughs novel  at the earth  s core provides little more than means to escape and give your brain a rest  a victorian scientist dr  abner perry peter cushing invents a giant burrowing machine  which he and his american partner doug mcclure use to corkscrew their way deep into the earth to explore what mysteries it may hold  they soon discover a lost world of subhuman creatures having conflict with prehistoric monsters  br    br   cushing comes across as an absent minded professor to the point of being annoying  instead of being a bold adventurer  he comes across effeminate  on the other hand mcclure overacted enough to make himself also laughable  caroline munro plays the pretty princess dia that refuses to leave her world near the center of the earth  also in the cast are  godfrey james  cy grant and michael crane             i have seen this film at least     times and i am still excited by it  the acting is perfect and the romance between joe and jean keeps me on the edge of my seat  plus i still think bryan brown is the tops  brilliant film             this show makes absolutely no sense  every week  two ladies go to an estate to do some gardening  and every week without fail  they somehow stumble upon a murder  because everyone who owns a big house with a large garden is involved in a murder  right  but even if they did somehow happen to stumble upon murder after murder  wouldn  t the smart thing to do be to tell the police  you know  the people who can actually do something about it    but every week  these two fools go around  polluting evidence  committing crimes of their own  and  in some cases  causing more murders  once they do miraculously solve the murders  there is no way the murderer could ever be convicted  all the evidence has been sabotaged  and you  d think people who are covering up murders would think not to hire these two  wouldn  t you  yay  we  ve solved the murder  now like every other week  let  s go and confront the murderer ourselves and  with no back up  tell them that we know about it  there is no way we could get ourselves into any danger  is there  rosemary and thyme is one of the worst shows on television  and certainly the most ridiculous             this movie was so bad it was funny  for awhile there i thought i was actually watching a parody of a bad movie  a la   for your consideration     the   cliffhanger   scene at the end had me laughing until my insides hurt  the script was dreadful enough  but coupled with sean young  s terrible acting    especially while she explains the entire plot in great detail  complete with flashbacks  while dangling off a cliff    makes it a truly classically bad movie worth watching  in fact the fakey shots in this scene reminded me of an ed wood movie  i still can  t believe how this thing got made  first of all  how did such a bad script get the green light  how did star actors get attached  were they at low points in their careers  questions  questions             meryl streep is such a genius  well  at least as an actress  i know she  s been made fun of for doing a lot of roles with accents  but she nails the accent every time  her performance as lindy chamberlain was inspiring  mrs  chamberlain  as portrayed here  was not particularly likable  nor all that smart  but that just makes streep  s work all the more remarkable  i think she is worth all    or so of her oscar nominations  about the film  well  there were a couple of interesting things  i don  t know much about australia  but the theme of religious bigotry among the general public played a big part in the story  i had largely missed this when i first saw the film some years ago  but it came through loud and clear yesterday  and it seems the australian press is just as accomplished at misery inducing pursuit and overkill as their american colleagues  a pretty good film  a bit different  grade  b              airport     is basically a slopped together mess for universal studios to try and work a new twist   the concorde supersonic airliner   into their   disaster in the sky   formula  br    br   bogged down with unintentional humor  the best of which is when george kennedy sticks his hand out of concorde  s window at supersonic speed to fire a flare gun at a heat seeking missile following the aircraft  s flight path  and the simple fact that these dumb passengers keep re boarding the same plane to continue their flight despite all the problems in the air  many stars in this one including robert wagner  sylvia kristel  alain delon  and martha raye as a nervous passenger   br    br   not really related to the other   airport   films             supposedly a   social commentary   on racism and prison conditions in the rural south of the       s    nightmare   is full of bad southern stereotypes  complete with phoney accents  not only would it be offensive to the sensibilities of most american southerners  this tawdry piece of work comes off as just a thinly disguised   babe in prison   movie  especially in its uncut original version  nevertheless  acting is generally above average and the late chuck connors  in particular  does a good job of making viewers hate him  even though he looks somewhat uncomfortable in several scenes  there  s also a change of pace role for the late robert reed  who appears as the lecherous warden  and tina louise  previously ginger of   gilligan  s island    made a rather believable sadistic prison guard  my grade  d   br    br               ok  i bought this film from woolworths for my friend for a joke present on his birthday  because the front cover had a sexual innuendo in it  br    br   but we decided it to watch it anyway  just for hilarity purposes  br    br   and i  m sorry  but this has got to be  one of the worst films in history  br    br   it began off alright  and we thought   ok this might actually be ok    but after about    minutes  we were sadly mistaken  br    br   it began when the   mysterious paint baller   turned out to be the most obvious character  the scouser australian  i say that because he had an accent which couldn  t be identified   who  s acting might i just say  was abysmal  br    br   then it got to the end  and by that time  we had all lost the will to live  the paint ball finals  br    br   the only thing i did like about this plot is that they didn  t actually win  but annoyingly enough they won by default  br    br   and i know this has nothing to do with it  but the name the team were given was just awful  critical damage  i mean they could of picked a more awesome name  like   the destroyers of the anti christ   or something  or that  s what the film should of been called anyway             insignificant and low brained  haha       s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen  yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind  the special effects are tacky  the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs    the brain   takes place in a typical quiet american town setting  where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet  it is here that a tv guru named dr  blake and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for nation wide mind controlling  under the label of   independent thinkers    a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill  how cool is that  now  it  s up to the meadowvale teen rebel to save the world  the funniest thing about the plot is that it never explains where dr  blake and his monstrous brain actually come from  there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that  s about it  meh  who needs a background in a movie like this  really  there  s not that much bloodshed unfortunately and the   evil   brain looks like an over sized sock puppet  the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie  director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made   bloody birthday    guilty pleasure of mine  and   plague    both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry  the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale  whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re animator  a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity factor and she  s obviously a great talent   she has exactly   movies on her repertoire of which this is her   masterpiece    in her debut  she was credited as   runaway model   and in     men and a baby    her character is referred to as   one of jack  s girls    i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress              does anyone remember the alternative comedy show the comic strip presents   one edition featured charles bronson   robbie coltrane   being interviewed about his new movie glc   br    br      it  s about a man   an ordinary man whose wife and family gets wiped out by creeps and i have to hunt them down and kill them in a sadistic and graphic manner     br    br      and after glc what next for bronson       br    br      we  re using a new angle   my family don  t get wiped out but i go after creeps just the same     br    br   this accurately describes the evil that men do   it  s a bronson vigilante thriller where his motivation isn  t down to a blood feud but this leads to credibility becoming strained  br    br   bronson is a retired hit man who isn  t giving up his retirement for anything until someone shows him a video tape featuring interviews with the victims of    the doctor      not the legendary time traveler but a infamous expert on torture   it  s never really explained why the doctor is so infamous since any police state has a myriad of these sadists nor is it explained why the doctor and his sister have ridiculous english accents  br    br   as you may guess it  s a lazily written movie and incidents happening because the screenwriter needs things to happen to further the plot no matter how unlikely they are like one of the bad guys getting invited to a threesome so he can be killed or things being revealed like the doctor  s sister being a lesbian so some t a can be included  br    br   in many ways it  s like one of those nasty chuck norris vehicles that were being released at the same time   but the most disappointing thing is that the director is also the same man who made ice cold in alex and the guns of naverone two very well regarded war dramas that are often shown on sunday afternoons   believe me this movie won  t be shown until well after the watershed            well  here  s another terrific example of awkward     s film making  the rudimentary premise of   what  s the matter with helen    is quite shocking and disturbing  but it  s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion  in the hands of any other movie crew  this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale  but with director curtis harrington    whoever slew auntie roo     and scriptwriter henry farrell    hush  hush  sweet charlotte    in charge  it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres  the basic plot of the film is definitely horrific  but there  s a lot more to experience  like love stories  a swinging       s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing  the setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique  we  re literally catapulted back to the       s  with a sublime depiction of that era  s music  religion  theatrical business and wardrobes  following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life imprisonment for murder  adelle  debbie reynolds  and helen  shelley winters  flee to california and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls  particularly adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment  as she falls in love with a local millionaire  but poor old helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia  she only listens to the ramblings of a radio evangelist  fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies  the script  although not entirely without flaws  is well written and the film is adequately paced  there  s never a dull moment in   what  s the matter with helen    although the singing  tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot  but the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of shelley winters  she  s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who  s about to snap any second and  especially during the last ten minutes or so  she looks more petrifying than all the freddy kruegers  jason voorhees   and michael myers   combined  there are several terrific supportive characters who are  sadly  a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential  like mich  al macliamm  ir as the cocky elocution teacher  agnes moorehead as the creepy priestess and timothy carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies   house  there are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the grand guignol fanatics among us  but particularly the set pieces and costume designs  even nominated for an oscar   are breathtaking             resnais  wow  the genius who brought us hiroshima mon amour takes on the challenge of making a     s french musical in vibrant colour  the opening voice over with old  embellished inter titles was a nice touch  then the camera aperture opens  like the old hand crankers  on a black   white placard  the camera backs off  or rather  up   suddenly showing us the surprisingly brilliant colours of an elegant table set for a tea party  this is all in the first    seconds  br    br   then the music starts  a rather banal and forgettable diddy featuring an unconvincing chorus of   girls blabbering some nonsense which has no relevance to the film  and yes  i speak french  so i can  t blame it on the subtitles   those characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people who break into an even more forgettable song  then they leave  and finally audrey tautou appears and we hear our first appreciable dialogue    minutes into the film  br    br   i  m not sure what resnais intended by starting off with such a yawning waste of time   musical cacophony  but the effect on the viewer is to make you want to hurl skittles at the screen and storm out  i endured  br    br   it didn  t get much better  i  ll tell you why  there is absolutely no familiarity with any of the characters  we don  t even see their faces half the time  as resnais seems too intent on showing off the expensive scenery to care about the actual people in front of the camera   people flit on   off stage like moths around a lamp  and we the audience are unable to focus on any particular person or plot  it  s as if you were to take every episode of the brady bunch and cram it into a   hour movie  with bad songs  br    br   the only thing that kept me watching as long as i did    hour  was that i was looking at the camera techniques  lighting and scenery which were all  i admit  excellent  but is that enough to hold your attention for   hours  not me  maybe tomorrow i  ll try watching the end  aw  who am i kidding  i have more important things to do  i  m sure you do  too  skip this             i saw this movie in the middle of the night  when i was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch  it  s one of those films where you stop to see what it is   just for a moment    but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can  t turn it off  no matter how bad it is  one of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it  s good and so bad it  s  well  just plain bad  it  s worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it  s both  great middle of the night fare  if only for the fabulous tennis drag  don  t even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that chad lowe is so obviously male  because logic does not apply             this movie takes the plot behind the sci fi flick   doppelganger    an astronaut from our earth crashing on a   counter earth   on the opposite side of the sun  and the cold war totalitarian vibes on that world  and tries to turn it into a pilot for a tv series  however  the whole thing sank without a trace  and tv is probably better off for it  br    br   everyone here is perfectly adequate in a   made for tv   way  cameron mitchell turns in his usual solid performance  so does glenn corbett  who seems to be a kind of poor man  s john saxon  who plays the rugged individualist whose very existence poses a threat to the foundation of the   world order   on counter earth  br    br   but the low budget and low energy and inconsistent script and the lack of any real imagination in the set designs and cinematography keep this sci fi adventure firmly tethered on the launch pad  br    br   i  ll give one example  in the original template for this pilot     doppleganger     the astronauts lose control of their landing vehicle in a thunderstorm  and crash their ship in a truly appalling sequence  it was obvious that their ship was never going to fly again   then the two astronauts stagger helplessly from the smoking remains of their vehicle in the middle of howling rains and winds  only to be smacked down and overcome by faceless men yelling through loudspeakers  br    br   in   stranded in space    the astronauts are sitting in their seats when buzzers sound  things start shaking  and the camera blurs into a blackout  and as a friend pointed out  it was pretty obvious that the actors were simply shaking themselves on their seats  the director wasn  t even shaking the camera or the set   i  ve seen episodes of   the twilight zone   and   the outer limits   that took more effort to establish mood and setting than this made for tv mediocrity  br    br   and that  in essence  is what  s wrong with   stranded in space    no budget  no time  no imagination   just making the token gestures and hoping the sci fi fan boys   imagination and enthusiasm will fill in the rest  sorry  guys  it didn  t work   br    br   i  m sure that everyone here just finished their work on this one and walked away  and never thought of it again  except as a listing on their c v  and that  s what you  the viewer will do  you  ll remember  if pressed  that you once watched a tv movie called   stranded in space    but it made no lasting impression on you  and you can  t recall too much about it             black comedy isn  t always an easy sell  every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful  like fargo  for example  but usually they don  t often find big audiences  people seem to either set their minds for comedy  or for serious mayhem  there doesn  t seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both  throw momma from the train was a fairly decent hit  yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age  danny devito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in       br    br   devito plays an odd mamma  s boy named owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with  the mother is played by anne ramsey  who passed away shortly after this was released  and she is quite a caricature  she is loud  ugly  rude  and overbearing  though owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself  he wants desperately to have his mother offed  he fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes  but he clearly doesn  t have the guts to actually do it himself  that  s where billy crystal comes in  crystal plays larry donner  owen  s creative writing teacher at a nearby community college  larry is a paranoid would be intellectual novelist who claims his ex wife stole his novel and made millions off it  he is currently trying to write a new one  but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence    the night was       owen hears larry wish his ex wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria  and borrowing the idea from strangers on a train  owen decides to travel to hawai  i and murder larry  s ex wife  once it appears he has done so  he expects larry to return the favor and kill his mother  the resulting action is often quite funny  and even poignant  it  s certainly never dull and often full of surprises  br    br   the acting is exceptional  even if ramsey was a bit over the top  crystal is as good as he can be  and devito has always been undervalued as a performer  the film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works  often painfully so  the film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes  and the off beat tone is truly refreshing  i have often been critical of the late     s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film making  throw momma from the train takes chances  both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot  how many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered  the film isn  t too long  and it is chock full of laughs  writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public  but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone    of    stars  br    br   the hound             back in       i had a really lengthy vacation around the fourth of july   something like    days off in a row what with two weeks paid vacation  weekends and the holiday itself  i stayed in town during that time  hanging out at my parents   house a lot  br    br   i didn  t have a tv in my apartment so i used to watch my parents   tube  i had just finished watching a segment of the x files when a program came on called personal fx  i was hooked instantly  i had always been fascinated with items in our home that had come from my parents   family homes and through inheritances from relatives   estates  and often wondered about their history  value  etc  br    br   after my long vacation  i used to go to my folks   house on my lunch hours just to catch personal fx  br    br   i can remember one episode during which co host claire carter announced that the new york apartment in which the series was filmed was being renovated and that once said renovations were complete that personl fx would return to the air  br    br   it never did  personal fx was the first  and best   of the collectible shows  and it vanished from the air  almost fifteen years later  i  m still sore  br    br   way to go  fx             paul verhoeven  s predecessor to his breakout hit   basic instinct   is a stylish and shocking neo noir thriller  verhoeven has become known for making somewhat sleazy trash films  both in his native holland and in america and this film is one of the reasons why  the fourth man follows the strange story of gerard reve  played by jeroen krabb     a gay  alcoholic and slightly mad writer who goes to vlissingen to give a talk on the stories he writes  while there  he meets the seductive christine halsslag  ren  e soutendijk  who takes him back to her house where he discovers a handsome picture of one of her lovers and proclaims that he will meet him  even if it kills him  br    br   paul verhoeven twists the truth many times in this film  and that ensures that you never quite know where you are with it  many of the occurrences in the fourth man could be what they appear to be  but they could easily be interpreted as something else entirely and this keeps the audience on the edge of their seats for the duration  and also makes the film work as this narrative is what it thrives on  paul verhoeven is not a filmmaker that feels he has to restrain himself  and that is one of things i like best about him  this film features a very shocking scene that made me feel ill for hours afterwards  and that doesn  t happen very often    i wont spoil it because it needs the surprise element to work   but you  ll see what i mean when you see the film  make sure you get the uncut version    there is also a number of other macabre scenes that are less shocking than the one i  ve mentioned  but are lovely nonetheless  a man gets eaten by lions  another one has a pipe sent through his skull  a boat is smashed in half   lovely  br    br   the acting in the fourth man isn  t anything to write home about  but it  s solid throughout  jeroen krabb   holds the audience  s attention and looks the part as the drunken writer  it is ren  e soutendijk that impresses the most  though  as the femme fatale at the centre of the tale  her performance is what sharon stone would imitate nine years later with basic instinct  but the original fatale did it best  paul verhoeven  s direction is solid throughout as he directs our attention through numerous points of view  all of which help to create the mystery of the story  verhoeven has gone on to make some rubbish  but he obviously has talent and it  s a shame that he doesn  t put it to better use  of all the verhoeven films i  ve seen  this is the best and although it might be difficult to come across  trust me  it  s worth the effort             i accept that most     s horror aren  t scary by today  s standards  but what the hell is this  when you see a title like this you expect to see blood and a blood thirsty beast  instead we get no blood at all and a beast who either wants to take over the world or live in peace on earth    yeah which is what the people wanted  br    br   the overall story is fine with the astronaut coming back to life and being one with the beast    but the title really kills the movie  night of the beast would have made the fans more happy because there really isn  t any blood to speak of  br    br   i like how the     s movies had endings that left room for a sequel but wisely never made one  this movie isn  t the worst i  ve ever seen but its almost up there  br    br     out of               demon wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs  it is definitely an awful example of a film  so awful in fact that i don  t even consider it a movie  i describe it more as a thing     a monstrous thing  a thing that must be stopped at all costs  my friends and i first discovered this     thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friend  s house  it was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies  we unfortunately picked this one   well  during the    minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up  the thing is literally pointless in every sense of the word  it  s just a cheap  poorly done rip off of evil dead  the whole   story   seems to be nothing more than some guy wanting to knock off his friends by inviting them to an abandoned house and letting demons rip them to pieces  i have a bet that the writers were actually writing the story while it was being filmed  i  ve seen bad horror movies before  manos  troll    hobgoblins      shudder  i would have to say that demon wind could definitely contend with any and all of these films on terms of sheer stupidity  watch it only if you enjoy laughing at stupid films  br    br   fun fact  this film is like a cockroach on steroids  much like the ouija board  every time we try to get rid of it  it always seems to mysteriously reappear  kind of scary huh             there is a difference between a   film    and a   movie    a film  regardless of quality  is ready for public consumption  a movie is what a group of friends gets together to make over the course of a weekend with a camcorder  in my time as a viewer  i have seen may examples of both  br    br   on september     i attended a screening of writer director jon satejowski  s   donnybrook    now having read the script and having seen two different cuts  a rough cut and the   finished   product  of this piece  i can safely say it is a movie  and a student movie  at that  it is  for lack of a better word  competent  which is to say  the director knew how to push record on a camera and capture moving images  the visuals are  for the most part  static and unimpressive  and dialog scenes are reduced to mostly long shots  with little to no close up shots to allow the audience to establish a relationship with the characters  i understand that this is a modestly budgeted film  but some visual flair would have been appreciated  and it would have gone a long way toward keeping the audience interested  br    br   granted  there have been independent pictures that have shown that limited camera work can be over come with well a well written  engrossing story and some sharp dialog  steven soderbergh  s   sex  lies  and videotape   comes immediately to mind  this movie  however  has neither  the main story is weak and unfocused  if the main plot is davie trying to mend his relationship with his father  then i feel this movie misses the point  what i got out of it is that davie  s main aspiration is to   change the face of rock   n   roll    however  we see very little activity on his part to show this  while there is one dream sequence at the beginning  and an impromptu performance of his at the end  all we seem to get are scenes of davie listening to music or casually strumming a guitar  we are simply told that davie has played a lot of gigs  but we never see him in full rock out mode  next time  show don  t tell the audience  anyone who has taken a creative writing class knows this  also  davie doesn  t look like someone that would have been big in the glam rock era of the       s  he looks like he  d be more comfortable in the early days of rock   n   roll  posing as james dean  s less talented brother  in the meantime  the rest of the movies events seem to happen at random to rather clich   characters  and story threads  that have little or nothing to do with the slim main story  are brought up and abandoned with alarming frequency  i e  the subplot involving terry  s father   if i want to see a film with this kind of haphazard construction  i will consider watching   napolean dynamite   again  a film i could barely make it through the first time  br    br   as for the above mentioned dialog scenes  i guess i should mention that they are few and extremely far between  is it too much to ask for characters who do speak  i don  t think it is  when the characters do speak  it is in short  choppy sentences  collections of oh so insightful questions  angered grunts or wildly over the top outbursts  these characters simply do not behave like normal  rational people  working with material like this  it is easy to understand why there is only one good performance in the film  al hudson  s  and that  s just because he  s doing a poor imitation of sam elliott for his time on screen  a good director  or at least one who is ready for the challenge of a feature director  would have been able to spot these problems and get the writer and camera people to correct them  however  with satejowski being so close to the material  he simply doesn  t see them  or  if he does  he is unwilling to take the necessary steps to fix them because it  ll hurt his creative vision  being unable or unwilling to deal with criticism in a constructive manner  is the mark of a self indulgent  misguided fool  just ask rob schneider   br    br   in the end  we are left with a poor  high school set  knock off of zach braff  s amazing   garden state   combined with the equally amazing   velvet goldmine    two films far more worthy of your time  br    br   now before any of the cast or crew come out of the word work to take me to task for this review  allow me to offer this  the best i can do is compliment mr  satejowski for having the ambition to make a film of his own and to put it out there for an audience to see  however  the hopes that this movie will be picked up and distributed are simply deluded visions of grandeur  this is a student movie  nothing more  nothing less  if the movie holds any promise  and let  s face it  at this point  it isn  t going to come from the acting  writing  or directing   it is this  if  if  the people associated with this film are willing  then  please  learn from this movie  file it away  and use the lessons learned on your next attempt  don  t attack your critics  or have friend or family do it for you  if you are able to do this  maybe the next one will be worthy of distribution  worthy of being called a   film    br    br   i am your audience  and i am willing to watch             please re watch all   series and do not go see this movie  the trailer is completely misleading and the   weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out   min tv episode into the most painful  hrs of my life  truly an awful film  tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins  micky has   line  and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns  also mr briss  s accent just changes about   times in the film tons of badly acted extras  and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for   hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this god awful piece of crap          batman and robin all is forgiven            finally  an iranian film that is not made by majidi  kiarostami or the makhmalbafs  this is a non documentary  an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the   system   in its ass  it  s all about football and its funny  its really funny  the director says   the places are real  the event is real  and so are the characters and the extras  this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors  as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness    the non actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a  your heart is made of stone b  you are blind  excellently scripted  the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness  it has won the jury grand prize  berlin        dear reader  it  s near perfect  where  where can i get hold of it             sometimes you just have to have patients when watching indie horror  if you can just toe tap your way through the slow paced early scenes  sometimes a real gem will present itself    this  unfortunately  was not the case with   satan  s whip    br    br   written and directed by jason maran    satan  s whip   attempts to drag us along on a boring snore fest of a film  with no real pay off at the end  i  m guessing that the black   white  and blue  cinematography must have been for a reason  however it is never explained why the majority of the blood is blue  and i found this increasingly annoying as the film went on  the story in itself is not that bad  and actually had some originality and decent content but the acting is simply pathetic  this  combined with the slow pacing and lack of any real  red  gore made   satan  s whip   one to forget quite quickly  i will give it a       rating for some witty dialog that made me chuckle  but alas that could not save this boring waste of my time             tainted look at kibbutz life br    br   this film is less a cultural story about a boy  s life in a kibbutz  but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general  in the first two minutes of the movie  the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves  and it  s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical   kibbutznikim    besides the two main characters  a clinically depressed woman and her young son  every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well  evil   br    br   the story centers on how the kibbutz  like some sort of cult  slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows  there is no happiness  no joy  no laughter in this kibbutz  every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny  hypocrisy  violence  cultism  repression etc  for example  while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome european looking    year old boy    his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his   jewish   physical appearance and brutish personality  he cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother  he treats these volunteers like trash  after his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn  t seen in a long time due to his military service  he orders  quote      linda  go take shower and i cum in two minutes     br    br   there is one other   good   character in this movie    a european foreigner who plays the mother  s boyfriend  when the animal rapist tries to hit the mother  s son  the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist  s arm  he is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for   violent   behavior against one of the kibbutz members  more hypocrisy  the indescribably annoying french woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age     or without love and gives an account of the actual act that  s supposed to be humorous for the audience  but is really just stupid  she of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy  s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse   br    br   the film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult  children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders  the mother apparently can  t   escape   the kibbutz  although in reality  anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose  it  s a mystery how the boy  s father died  but you can rest assured  the kibbutz   drove him to it   and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless  wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son   br    br   that  s the gist of this movie  one dimensional characters  over dramatization  dry performances  and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience  s head    that kibbutz life was degrading  miserable and even deadly for those who didn  t   fit in    i feel sorry for the guy who made this film    obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz  but i feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs              when will i ever learn    the ecstatic reviewer on npr made me think this turkey was another citizen kane  please allow me to vent my spleen    br    br   i will admit  the setting  presumably new york city  has never been so downright ugly and unappealing  i am reminded that the     s was a bad decade for men  s fashion and automobiles  and all the smoking   if the plan was to cheapen the characters  it succeeded  br    br   for a film to work  at least  in my simple estimation   there has to be at least one sympathetic character  only ned beaty came close  and i could not wait for him to finish off nicky  if a stray shot had struck mikey  well  it may have elicited a shrug of indifference at the most  br    br   i can  t remember when i detested a film as strongly  i suppose i  m a rube who doesn  t dig   art   flicks  oh  well               lost              carnivale      desperate housewifes     the list goes on and on  these  and a bunch of other high quality  shows proves that we  re in the middle of a golden age in television history    lost   is pure genius  incredible layers of personal  and psychologically viable  stories  underscored by sublime cinematography  incredible to use this word  when describing a tv show   a killer score  great performances and editing  anyone who isn  t hooked on this  are missing one of the most important creative expressions in television ever  it may have its problems  when watching only one episode a week  but the dvd format is actually an incredible way to watch this  hope they keep it up  as i  m sure they do              clifton webb is one of my favorites  however  mister scoutmaster is not one of his best  his patented curmudgeon role seems forced and even unpleasant rather than funny  the film itself is overflowing with mawkish sentimentality  in addition  the viewer is presented with numerous ham handed references to religious faith and u s  patriotism that come off as over reverent rather than genuine  clifton webb does his best with a poor script  edmund gwenn plays yet another jovial clergyman and is given nothing to do  the child actor lead is played by a talentless child who displays a flat affect throughout the entire film  his sole claim to fame as a performer evidently is a bullfrog like low voice unusual for someone of his age  however  once you  ve heard it  you  ve heard it and you don  t need to hear it again  unfortunately  he is in the majority of the film  s scenes  i find this child so irritating that i fast forward whenever he shows up  since he has a lot of scenes in this film  this means that i fast forward through a lot of the film  there were and are so many talented child actors  it  s a pity this film doesn  t have any of them in it  still  clifton webb in the traditional broad brimmed hat and shorts is a sight worth seeing             this is a must see documentary movie for anyone who fears that modern youth has lost its taste for real life adventure and its sense of morality  darius goes west is an amazing roller coaster of a story  we live the lives of darius and the crew as they embark on the journey of a lifetime  darius has duchenne muscular dystrophy  a disease which affects all the muscles in his body  he is confined to a wheelchair  and needs round the clock attention  so how could this crew of young friends possibly manage to take him on a       mile round trip to the west coast and back  watch the movie and experience the ups and downs of this great adventure   laugh and cry with the crew as they cope with unimaginable challenges along the way  and enjoy the final triumph when they arrive back three weeks later in their home town to a rapturous reception and some great surprises             the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses  the mythical city of everytown in      represents england in general  but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world  when war finally does arrive  it  s ravages continue not for another five years  but until      at which time everytown is completely destroyed  adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the   wandering sickness    a pestilence that continues for another four years  br    br     things to come   balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view  where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization  the   wings over the world   concept plays out a bit corny  though it  s spokesman cabal  raymond massey  is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause  if he fails  others will follow  this message is continually reinforced throughout the film  brought home convincingly in massey  s end of movie speech  man  s insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an   all the universe or nothing   mindset  br    br   the film  s imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film   metropolis    as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year       the spectacle of the city  s rebirth strikes a resonant chord  as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie  s eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition  where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man  s first mission to the moon  but in       a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than       br    br     things to come   is one of those rarities in film  a picture that makes you think  which side will you come down on  the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo  it  s not a comfortable question  as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes  those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control             fulci    does this man brings one of the goriest and weirdest movies ever made  answer  yes  cat in the brain  also known as nightmare concert is fulci  s last masterpiece  yes it is  no matter what some people will say about it  there are few facts why this movie is one of the best fulci  s movies  br    br   fulci make a fun of himself and his movies with this one  lead roll in this movie is no other then fulci himself  who plays    well horror splatter gore director  who thinks he is slowly going insane  it  s filled with black humor which unlike in the most of the modern horror movies works here  being fulci flick  you need to know it  s gory  how much  well pretty much  i always loved gore in the movies and i never get enough of it  but cat in the brain actually stopped my thirst for gore  and believe me  it  s a hard to archive  even the braindead didn  t stop it  citb is all about gore  almost every scene revolves about fulci  who after being hypnotized by  khmmm  evil psychiatrists is seeing all kinds of horrors for everything that happens to him or everything he sees  some of the scenes involves him accidentally dropping the whiskey  and instead of that he sees rotten corpse lying on the floor  which starts to spit some ooze from it  s wounds  forget the beyond or zombie    this is the goriest fulci movie  now i like how fulci manage to apply all those comic parts in the gorefest movie  he is such a brilliant director  some funny moments and lines happens from time to time  like one where fulci says   making gore movies is kind of a sickness   ending is very good considering that fulci  and most of the italian horror masters  is know for making ending with no sense or many plot holes  if you are fun of the fulci  make sure you check it out  if you have a weak stomach  avoid this and repeat   its only a movie   ps  some of the gore scenes within this movie  chainsaw dismemberment  full   tongue torn out  eyeballs torn out  maggot infested corpses  zombies  decapitations  face being putted in boiling water  stabs in the shower  to head   throat slit  many parts of the body and organs being toast aside  hammer smashed face               what an incomprehensible mess of a movie  something about a cop who extracts bullets from himself after he gets shot and keeps them in a glass jar in his bathroom  and from the size of the jar he  s been shot about fifty times by now  and a top secret tank guarded by five or six incompetent soldiers who for some reason drive it into mexico  whether they were sent there intentionally or just got really really lost is never made clear  and you  ll never hear another screenplay feature the word   butthorn   either  gary busey tries out the mel gibson role from   lethal weapon   and while busey is a serviceable actor the screenplay damns the whole movie to mediocrity  william smith does another turn as a russian soldier  the same character he played in   red dawn   a few years earlier  after playing biker heavies for most of the   s it was sort of nice to see him expand his range playing communist heavies  sadly he  ll probably always be remembered best as the guy who clint eastwood whupped in   every which way you can              i love to watch this movie a lot because of all the scary scenes about the raptors  i like raptors because they are scary  my favorite parts are the ones where the raptor looks behind the pillar because it reminds me of a scene from the friday the   th movie with the girl who eats the banana  br    br   i really love to watch a lot of this movie because the computer graphics seem a little fake but it s okay because once you get into the movie you hardly even notice what is going on and i think it s got a good ending even though i didn t really understand what was going on on my first couple viewings i figured it out over time and that s the important part  the other important part is how scary the dinosaurs can be if you re watching it the first time  br    br   this is best movie            warning  review contains mild spoilers br    br   a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise  and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st  series  however  just two years on and i find i can  t remember enough about them in order to do it    i guess they couldn  t have made much of an impression  from what i do recall  some of the sequels    dream warriors in particular    weren  t as bad as is often made out  though even the original was no classic  generally  the predictability of the premise  if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams  doesn  t lend itself to narrative tension  but while i cannot recall much of the first five films  i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy  s dead  br    br   an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character  s demise  the fact that the movie  s conclusion is not even hidden  but in fact the entire purpose for the film  s being goes to illustrate how vacant  soulless and cynical this venture was  br    br   taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain  robert englund  s in no way scary interpretation booms with laughter  i always thought freddy  s mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe  it  s like englund  s crying out   we know this is garbage    but you  re paying to see it  so who  s the one laughing    and i  m sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight  was freddy  s appearance in the films always so rudimentary  all he gets to do here is a few   haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr    har    har    hars   and that  s it  if this was the only elm st  film you  d ever seen you wouldn  t get to know the character at all  even as the character pre death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic  ie  overstated  misplaced and not at all funny  irony  br    br   acting is almost universally poor  just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language  only kananga himself  yaphet kotto  keeps his dignity  and when roseanne  tom arnold and alice cooper show up  you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire  the script  too  is absolutely lousy  almost wholly without merit  carlos  ricky dean logan  opens a road map  upon which the noel coward like freddy has wittily written   you  re f  ked    when prompted for the map  carlos responds   well the map says we  re f  ked    who wrote the screenplay  oscar wilde  br    br   or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy  his hearing enhanced to painful levels  so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin    a potentially fatal sound  given that all sounds are magnified  oddly  the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect    nice hearing from you  carlos    quips freddy  hoping some better lines will come along  it  s also worth noting that dream sleep doesn  t occur instaneously  so being knocked unconscious wouldn  t allow instant access into freddy  s world  though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a   d finale plot logic isn  t that high on the list of requirements  br    br   the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious  dislikeable group in the whole series  tracy  lezlie deane  is the only one who gets to greet freddy with   shut the f  k up  man   and a kick in the scallops  and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients  freddy  s dead  no laughs  no scares  no interest  no fun  br    br               some comments here on imdb have likened dog bite dog to the classic cat iii films of the   s  but although it is undoubtedly brutal  violent and very downbeat  this film from pou soi cheang isn  t really sleazy  lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison  however  it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch  particularly if gritty  hard edged action is your thing  br    br   edison chen plays pang  a cambodian hit man who travels to hong kong to assassinate the wife of a judge  sam lee is wai  the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down  whatever the cost  with wai closing in on his target  pang will stop at nothing to ensure his escape  until he meets yue  a pretty illegal immigrant who needs his help to escape her life of abuse  br    br   a relentlessly harsh drama with great cinematography  amazing sound design  a haunting score  and solid performances from chen and lee  as well as newcomer pei pei as pang  s love interest   dog bite dog is one for fans of hard hitting asian hyper violence  think along the lines of chan wook park  s vengeance trilogy   stabbings  shootings  merciless beatings  all happen regularly in this film and are caught unflinchingly by director cheang  br    br   of course  this is the kind of tale that is destined to have an unhappy ending for all involved  and sure enough  pretty much everyone in this film dies  rather nasty deaths   unfortunately  there is a fine line between tragedy and  unintentional  comedy  and in its final moments  dog bite dog crosses it  in a laughably over dramatic final scene  pang and wai are locked in battle as a pregnant yue looks on  eventually  after all three have suffered severe stab wounds during the fracas  a wounded pang performs a diy ceasarean on  a now dead  yue  delivering their baby moments before he himself dies  br    br   whilst this film might not be a   classic   slice of hong kong excess  with its deliriously ott action and stylish visuals  it  s still worth seeking out             i watched this movie for the hot guy  and even he sucked  he was the worst one  well  okay  i have to give props to that freaky police officer rapist guy too  he was even worse  the guy wasn  t that cute in the end  he had the most terrible accent  and he was the most definite definition of hicksville idiot that can  t stand up to his mom for the one he   loves   there  s ever been  overall  and if this makes any sense to you  when i go to pick up movies at the video store  i think to myself as i read the back of a movie that looks so so    well  at least it can  t be worse than carolina moon    the most terrible movie  and the most terrible writing  acting  plot  everything in it made my gag reflexes want to do back flips  it was the most horrid movie i will ever see  with gabriela way up there too  i hated it  and trust me  if there was any number under   imdb had for rating  i  d choose that in a heartbeat             absolute must see documentary for anyone interested in getting to the bottom of this story  told with unflinching eye and with gripping style  if you think conspiracy theories are for paranoid disturbed people  this could change your mind  something for you feds too  a good model for government coverups  if you like your news all tidy and easy to consume this is not for you             i have decided to not believe what famous movie critics say  even though this movie did not get the best comments  this movie made my day  it got me thinking  what a false world this is  br    br   what do you do when your most loved ones deceive you  it  s said that no matter how often you feed milk to a snake  it can never be loyal and will bite when given a chance  same way some people are such that they are never grateful  this movie is about how selfish people can be and how everyone is ultimately just thinking about oneself and working for oneself   br    br   a brother dies inadvertently at the hands of a gangster  the surviving brother decides to take revenge  through this process  we learn about the futility of this world  nothing is real and no one is loyal to anyone  br    br   amitabh gave the performance of his life  the new actor aryan gave a good performance  the actress who played the wife of amitabh stole the show  her role was small but she portrayed her role so diligently that one is moved by her performance  chawla had really great face expressions but her role was very limited and was not given a chance to fully express herself  br    br   a great movie by raj kumar santoshi  his movies always give some message to the audience  his movies are like novels of nanak singh  a punjabi novelist who  s novels always had a purpose and targeted a social evil  because they have a real message for the audience  they are entertaining as well as lesson giving             after a very scary  crude opening which gives you that creepy   chainsaw massacre   feeling  everything falls apart  br    br   spoiler alert  as soon as the two fbi officers start jabbing  you know they are the real killers  anyone who have seen enough of these   fooled ya   movies can figure this out  br    br   this movie is mader with one thing in mind  to depict brutal murders  why  then  is not the little girl tortured and murdered as well  will this be next for us movie goers  the torture and abuse of children  whats wrong with you people  lynch is truly has a disgusting  ugly mind             i can  t say much about this film  i think it speaks for itself  as do the current ratings on here   i rented this about two years ago and i totally regretted it  i even  tried  to like it by watching it twice  but i just couldn  t  i can safely say that i have absolutely no desire to see this waste of time ever  ever again  and i  m not one to trash a movie  but i truly believe this was awful  it wasn  t even funny in the slightest  the only bits i enjoyed were the few scenes with christopher walken in them  i think this film ruined both jack black and ben stiller for me  all i can think of when i see one of their films now a days is this terrible movie  and it reminds me not to waste my money  amy poehler is so very annoying  too  br    br   overall  well  i think you get my point  the stars are for walken  by the way             i am not so old that i can  t remember laughing at bobcat goldthwait a couple times  but some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells  br    br   from the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead  neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line  goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better  even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades   br    br   if you ever saw shakes the clown you know how unfunny bobcat was    years ago   this movie is worse  it was not even funny by accident it is sad  pathetic and a total waste of time  may goldthwaits   hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script  strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene  he is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into hollywood            in new orleans  an illegal immigrant feels sick and leaves a poker game while winning the smalltime criminal blackie  walter jack palance   he is chased by blackie and his men raymond fitch

a simple story  but it is still effective and with a great villain  the engaging plot has not become dated after fifty seven years  jack palance performs a despicable scum in his debut  and the camera work while he tries to escape with zero mostel is still very impressive  my vote is seven  br    br   title  brazil     p  nico nas ruas      panic in the streets               the box is why i originally picked up this movie and the back is why i rented it  but i soon learned that i had been duped  i had thought this movie would be something like a road trip eurotrip american pie deal  but i was wrong  this movie is one of the dumbest i  ve seen in a long time  the unrated version teases you in to watching but will completely disappoint you  the acting was terrible and sound effects just gaudy  it appeared very low budget with the entire setting taking place in the same building  go out and get eurotrip or road trip instead  i can  t believe national lampoon put its name on this  don  t buy it  don  t rent it  don  t waste   hours of your life on this             there have been many documentaries that i have seen in which it appeared that the law was on the wrong side of the fence   the thin blue line and paradise lost come to mind first and foremost  but this is the first film that had me seething with anger after i saw it  it seems blatantly clear to me from the evidence presented in this film that what happened at waco was at the very least an unprofessional and sloppy mess on the part of the fbi and afi  and at the very worst an act of murder  like most people  when the siege at waco was occurring i assumed that david koresh was a completely evil madman who was leading a violent cult  after seeing this  i think that koresh was more likely a slightly unbalanced and confused guy who inadvertently caught the attention of the u s  government through his eccentric actions  sure  there were lots of weapons at the branch davidian compound  but none of it was illegal  it was absolutely heartbreaking to see the video footage of the people inside the compound  all of them seeming to be very nice and harmless  and it was angering to see the callous testimony of the men in charge of the government forces on the waco site  the clueless testimony of janet reno  and the partisan defense of the attack on waco  a defense led by a few of the committee democrats  standing out most in my mind was ny representative and current u s  senator from ny charles schumer  i voted for the man when i lived in ny state   i  m a democrat  pretty left leaning too  after seeing his actions on this committee  i wish i could go back in time and vote for d  amato instead  for anyone remotely interested in the government  this is a very crucial film  a must see  i even think this should be shown in classes   it  s that important             i saw this movie last night and thought it was decent  it has it  s moments i guess you would say  some of the scenes with the special ops forces were cool  and some of the location shots were very authentic  i won  t be putting this movie in my dvd collection but it is fair enough to recommend for renting  i guess nothing set the movie at another level compared to others of the same genre  the action is good  the acting is decent  the women are extremely seductive and exotic in my opinion  and the story is pretty interesting    out of ten            yes  i call this a perfect movie  not one boring second  a fantastic cast of mostly little known actresses and actors  a great array of characters who are all well defined and who all have understandable motives i could sympathize with  perfect lighting  crisp black and white photography  a fitting soundtrack  an intelligent and harmonious set design and a story that is engaging and works  it  s one of those prime quality pictures on which all the pride of hollywood should rest  the mark everyone should endeavor to reach  br    br   barbara stanwyck is simply stunning  there was nothing this actress couldn  t do  and she always went easy on the melodramatic side  no hysterical outbursts with this lady   i always thought she was a better actress than screen goddesses like bette davis or joan crawford  and this movie confirmed my opinion  always as tough as nails and at the same time conveying true sentiments  it is fair to add that she also got many good parts during her long career  and this one is by far the least interesting  br    br   the title fits this movie very well  it is about desires  human desires i think everyone can understand  actually  no one seems to be scheming in this movie  all characters act on impulse  everybody wants to be happy without hurting anybody else  the sad fact that this more often than not leads to complications makes for the dramatic content into which i will not go here  br    br   i liked what this movie has to say about youth  about maturing and about the necessity to compromise  the movie i associate most with this one is alfred hitchcock  s shadow of a doubt  it creates a similar atmosphere of idealized and at the same time caricatured small town america  the story has a certain similarity with fritz lang  s considerably harsher movie clash by night  made one year earlier  where stanywck stars in a similar part  i can also recommend it             i would like to know if anyone know how i can get a copy of the movie    that  s the way of the world    it  s been about    years since i  ve seen this movie  and i would like to see it again  earth wind   fire transcend the nation globally with their inspirational music and themes  it was unfortunate that this group didn  t take off like their counterparts in the early     s  but as previously stated  racial tension existed in the united states which prohibited equalized exposure for the african american musical groups  it is good to see that earth wind   fire continuing their success  i would like to add this movie to my collection  someone please help me if possible  thank you for your attention  milton shaw            i saw the movie   hoot   and then i immediately decided to comment it  the truth is that nature needs protection from us because we are the dominant specie of this planet  some people think that if they have money  they can do whatever they want to  which probably is like  but if they think about the future more then they think about themselves they would do something useful  this movie is not just about kids  this movie is showing us that the kids are usually the ones that care more about it then the adults do  when i was twelve  i saw some waterlilies and i knew they are protected by law and didn  t even dare to touch them not fearing of the law  but fearing that i might harm them actually   i am currently     what so ever  the acting was great  the   main characters are well interpreted and we all have to learn from them  i hope you all think about what you saw in that movie    and enjoy             i had some reservations about this movie  i figured it would be the usual bill of fare     a formula movie about christmas  being in the middle of a heat wave in late june  we decided to give it a shot anyway  maybe we would see some snow  br    br   this movie turned out to be one laugh after another  ben affleck was believable in his character  but the real star of this one is james gandofini  he delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great   dad    br    br   if you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours  definitely check this one out             when i first saw this film around   months ago  i considered it interesting  but little more  but it stuck with me  that interest grew and grew  and i wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual vhs quality rather than the film itself  i purchased the criterion dvd box set  and it turns out that i was right the second time  alexander nevsky is a great film  it is rousing  and i  m sure it succeeded in its main aim  propaganda against the germans  br    br   that is the most common criticism against this film  and against eisenstein  that it is merely propagandist and nothing else  it  s untrue  he is an amazing film artist  one of the most important whoever lived  by now  the world is far enough beyond joseph stalin to be able to watch eisenstein  s films as art             focus is another great movie starring william h  macy  i first discovered macy in fargo and i  ve seen a few of his films and he hasn  t yet deceived me  macy is the archetypal   nice guy with something to hide    in focus  he plays the role of lawrence newman  a loyal and hard working stiff  who harbours his handicapped mother at home  the scene is set after world war ii  at the height of mccarthyism  newman is the head of human resources for a company which is basically  anti semite  after he accidentally hires a woman of jewish descent  he is asked to buy a pair of glasses  to improve his failing eyesight  br    br   unbelievably  the simple act of buying glasses has great repercussions on his life and that of gertrude hart  his wife  played by a great laura dern   as the film unravels  newman will begin to see a whole different world  where being jewish is akin to being an animal  br    br   the movie is disturbing in the way it shows that being racist was something fairly normal  the chilling thought is that in some places  it probably still is             in   brave new girl    holly comes from a small town in texas  sings   the yellow rose of texas   at a local competition  and gets admitted to a prestigious arts college in philadelphia  from there the movie grows into a colorful story of friendship and loyalty  i loved this movie  it was full of great singing and acting and characters that kept it moving at a very nice pace  the acting was  of course  wonderful  virginia madsen and lindsey haun were outstanding  as well as nick roth the camera work was really done well and i was very pleased with the end  it seems a sequel could be in the making   kudos to the director and all others that participated on this production  quite a gem in the film archives             despite a totally misleading advertising campaign  this flick turns out to be an irritatingly clich  d  sub par haunted house flick with a totally implausible ending  clue    for all considering seeing this turkey  sam raimi didn  t direct it  although commercials for the movie play up his involvement  in truth he is one of four producers  it  s too bad that someone as talented as raimi has allowed his name to be used in conjunction with such a poor movie  i don  t think he would ever have directed something like this  that task was left to the pang brothers  br    br   the screenplay for this film seems to have been cobbled together from numerous other   horror   films  so you  ll find absolutely zero original content in   the messengers    what we get are a scene here and there that was plucked straight out of   pulse    a couple that could have come from   the birds    one or two from   the others    etc  nearly every scene  almost every line of dialogue  is one that has been lifted from any number of other movies  the whole thing makes for such a predictable movie that almost anyone will be able to figure out the   surprise ending   long before it comes  br    br   right about here would be a good time to point out that the advertising campaign  centered on the idea that only children can see ghosts  has nothing to do with this movie  in fact  everyone can see the ghosts  the teenage daughter and mother characters certainly see them  even quite early in the movie  i  m sure that whomever was in charge of marketing came up with this campaign because the film needed a unique angle to have any box office appeal  which otherwise is entirely absent  now you know  so don  t be fooled  perhaps what this movie lacks most of all is anything resembling chemistry between the actors  it simply isn  t there  all of the interactions come across as awkwardly stilted  coupled with the hackneyed story and ridiculous plot holes  just what is a guy who murdered his whole family doing still lurking around the small town where the murder happened  anyhow  didn  t anyone think to maybe arrest him    it all adds up to a profoundly unsatisfying ghost flick that only manages to surprise anyone over the age of ten with cheap shots  loud noises  visual flashes  and anything short of a sheeted figure jumping out of a closet and yelling   boo    all we get for our buck this time around is yet another poorly made film about spirits attempting to warn people away from a house  if there  s any message that   the messengers   delivers  it  s   don  t waste your time on this movie               this movie sucks ass  something about a heatwave in some european country  complete trash  there  s nothing going for this movie whatsoever  maybe    seconds of sex but that  s it  there is a very annoying chick who hitches rides with people and really pisses me off  this movie is complete rash and you shouldn  t subject yourself to watching it  i regret it it  s very boring  i would rate it zero but i can  t  no body in their right mind should see this  i  m sure you  ll regret it completely i did  how could they think up something this bad  even mystery men was better  mystery men  that sucks  that movie wasn  t worth being made  complete waste of time  the characters in this are very hard to understand and i good very very very bored             i was looking forward to the guardian  but when i walked into the theater i wasn  t really in the mood for it at that particular time  it  s kind of like the olive garden   i like it  but i have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy it  br    br   i  m not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit  the trailers looked good  but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last kevin costner movie that dealt with the subject   waterworld  plus  despite the promise ashton kutcher showed in the butterfly effect  i  m still not completely sold on him  something about the guy just annoys me  probably has to do with his simian features  br    br   it took approximately two minutes for my fears to subside and for my hesitancies to slip away  the movie immediately throws us into the midst of a tense rescue mission  and i was gripped tighter than kenny rogers   orange face lift  my concerns briefly bristled at kutcher  s initial appearance due to the fact that too much effort was made to paint him as ridiculously cool and rebellious  sunglasses  a tough guy toothpick in his mouth  and sportin   a smirk that  d make george clooney proud  yeah  we get it  i was totally ready to hate him  br    br   but then he had to go and deliver a fairly strong performance and force me to soften my jabs   br    br   darn you  ape man  efficiently mixing tense  exciting rescue scenes  drama  humor  and solid acting  the guardian is easily a film that i dare say the majority of audiences will enjoy  you can quibble about its clich  s  predictability  and rare moments of overcooked sappiness  but none of that takes away from the entertainment value  br    br   i had a bad feeling that the pace would slow too much when costner started training the young guys  but on the contrary  the training sessions just might be the most interesting aspect of the film  coast guard rescue swimmers are heroes whose stories have never really been portrayed on the big screen  so i feel the inside look at what they go through and how tough it is to make it is very informative and a great way to introduce audiences to this under appreciated group  br    br   do you have what it takes to be a rescue swimmer  just think about it  you get to go on dangerous missions in cold  dark  rough water  and then you must fight disorientation  exhaustion  hypothermia  and a lack of oxygen all while trying to help stranded  panicked people who are depending on you for their survival  and if all that isn  t bad enough  sometimes you can  t save everybody so you have to make the tough decision of who lives and who dies  br    br   man  who wants all that responsibility  not me  i had no idea what it was really like for these guys  and who would have thought i  d have an ashton kutcher kevin costner movie to thank for the education   br    br   not only does the guardian do a great job of paying tribute to this rare breed of hero  but lucky for us it also does a good job of entertaining its paying customers  br    br   the gist  br    br   moviegoers wanting an inside look at what it  s like to embark on a daring rescue mission in the middle of the ocean might want to give the guardian a chance  i saw it for free  but had i paid i would  ve felt i had gotten my money  s worth             going into see seven pounds i wasn  t clearly sure what to think because the previews left to much open to grasp what the movie was really about  so within the first    min or so you are completely lost in the plot  have no idea what is going on and you think tim  who claims to be ben  is just a big asshole  all of this comes to an end when the   twist   so to speak  is unraveled at the very last minute of the movie  basically tim  will smith  was troubled and haunted by a big accident he made causing the end of seven peoples lives  by this he decides to scope out seven new people who are in need of help badly who he in turns gives his life to  br    br   the acting of this film is great  as i feel will smith no matter what part he seems to impress  rosario dawson  to me  this is one of her better movies  aside from eagle eye which i think is up there to  she has been in some bad some good but she does deliver in this film  other actors  such as woody harrelson  have very small roles and not a big enough role to grasp the character  although the casting of the film was still good  br    br   this movie was definitely not what i expected and certainly a lot slower pace in which i hoped  the movie  however  was still pretty good  nothing is revealed until the last   min of the movie and everything falls into place  up until then it just seems like a pointless love story  final thought seven pounds seven stars             i saw brother  s shadow at the tribeca film festival and loved it  judd hirsch and scott cohen are great as father and son  the film follows scott cohen from parole in alaska back to his family in brooklyn  he shows up there because his brother has died  and he embarks on a journey to slowly repair his estranged relationships with his brother  s wife and child and his father who has never forgiven him for being the black sheep of the family  the story takes us deep into the hearts and minds of this family and allows you to more deeply understand the complexity of their lives  also  the imagery of the woodworking business and the brooklyn backdrop sets the tone for this rich and revealing family portrait               marar  xada   really disappointed me  i can  t consider it as a bad movie  but the development just seemed too rushed and non believable for it to evoke any emotions  dr  ferm  xadn displays some unprecedented bizarre behaviour out of a passion that one can  t really understand where it was born from  i mean  how many times does he ever have a conversation with marar  xada   maybe once  also  marar  xada never appeared to be a real character  instead more like a film stereotype that just needed to be in the movie     or else another title was needed    some of the best acting came from a role that wasn  t really important to the story  that of marcial  the sub intelligent yet humble drunkard  of course  the scenery  the cultural tidbits of the canary islands  and other   wow   moments were interesting  but the movie fell short of a documentary  in case this was its real intention   and most importantly  as a solid drama             serum is about a crazy doctor that finds a serum that is supposed to cure all diseases through the power of the mind  instead it creates some kind of monster that needs to eat human flesh and brains  the mad doc creates some zombies out of cadavers and has some problems  there is a very long lead into all the action with many scenes getting you acquainted with the characters  the mad doctor  s nephew gets into a car accident and the mad doc tries to use his new serum on the boy  the results are not good  this is a class c film with ok acting but some troubles directing and some continuity errors  there isn  t much zombie action in this one and the effects  while adequate  are nothing special  you can fast forward through the slow parts and get some enjoyment out of the action scenes  watch out for some nudity and bad language            witty  funny  intelligent  awesome  i was flipping channels late one night years ago  came across this and a wildfire started  i was staying up late every night and taping it for everyone i know  a few  like   people out of the almost     people i made watch this didn t think it was as awesome as i did  the others were laughing out loud so hard they were crying and thanking me at the same time  please do yourself a favor  run don t walk  watch this and enjoy  intelligence and humor  it s a win win situation  i wish i could have afternoon tea with him and meet the truly rare comedian that we as a society need more of    sanechaos            it  s a unique film  as it gives us our only chance to see the young noel coward in all his ironic glory  because he seems so reserved   detached he  s perfect for the role of an unloved cad who matter of factly uses all those around him  however in the deadly serious  no pun intended  last act  when coward must make like the flying dutchman  he  s much less comfortable  br    br   but his way with an epigram is peerless  and hecht   macarthur have given him some gems  macarthur  really    he was the wit of the pair   br    br   the film is superbly lighted by the great lee garmes  but has little camera movement aside from a storm sequence  hecht and macarthutr cared about one thing    getting their dialogue on screen   note  h m themselves have blink and you  ll miss   em cameos as bums in the flophouse scene   br    br   the most notable supporting player is the one and only alexander woolcott  notorious broadway columnist and close friend of both macarthur and coward  who appears as one of the bitchy authors always kept waiting in the reception room of publisher coward  br    br   curious that woolcott would agree to do a film that clearly lampoons the legendary algonquin round table  of which he was a founder  and macarthur something of an auxiliary member  br    br   the scoundrel actually won an oscar for best story  though that victory is probably due more to coward  s imposing presence than any brilliance in the plot  it  s coward  woolcott  and the dialogue you remember               this is definitely a   must see   film  the excellent director alain chabat  also acting as ceasar  has managed to capture the very essence of the   adventures of ast  rix    the french comic books it  s based upon  and to create a fantastically modern and intelligent comedy  which is also an homage to the world of animated films  this movie is so funny  so full of jokes  both visual and spoken  that it might take you two or three screenings before you notice them all  between your bursts of laughter  the only drawback is that a non french audience  or at least a non french speaking audience  might not get all the   private jokes    there are so many dialogues impossible to translate  so many situations directly related either to the comic books or to the french way of life  that the fun might be lessened  however  it  s still totally worth seeing for the beautiful picture  the amazing stunts  the music  the totally crazy atmosphere and the excellent acting  all actors are great  but the film would not be the same without jamel debouze  g  rard darmon and edouard baer  and please don  t ever compare this magnificent film to the terrible previous one based on the same comic books     ast  rix et ob  lix contre c  sar   and directed by claude zidi             i thought this movie was stunning  with completely outstanding performances by valentina cervi  artemisia gentileschi   br    br   cervi portrays artemisia so beautifully  with tentative yet confidant mannerisms  her hands mapping out an idea before moving her models into place  the passion to which artemisia gives to her art is just spectacular to watch  br    br   although not each character was overtly beautiful  this made the film more realistic as the facial hair and clothing was perfect for that point in time  br    br   overall i thought this film was fantastic             i consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of boxing movies and as such there is only one thing that prevents me from calling   gentleman jim   the best boxing movie ever made  that is the robert wise paul newman flick   somebody up there likes me    that movie might be number    but   gentleman jim   is a close number    br    br   the movie doesn  t just chronicle the rise of james j  corbett  it also shows the sport of boxing at a crucial time of transition  in the late     s boxing was moving away from the brutal days of bare knuckle rules to the more   gentlemanly   days of the gloved  marquis of queensbury rules  and the sport was moving away from the days when it was an illegal spectacle and towards a time of acceptance and respectability  br    br     gentleman jim   is not a realistic look at those days  it is romanticized and  yes  even a bit hokey at times  but always delightfully so  errol flynn is perfect as the   gentleman   jim who really isn  t a   gentleman   at all but merely a fast talker from a working class family  alexis smith is quite ravishing as the upper class woman with whom he has a love hate relationship  and we all know it is  of course  love that will win that match in the end   br    br   at the end of   gentleman jim   the great john l sullivan  whose famous line was not   i can lick any man in the world   of course   romanticism again  hands over his belt to corbett  this is truly one of the best scenes in any sports move ever made  realistic  no  but wonderful  hey  if you want realism watch   raging bull   instead  that is a much more realistic boxing movie  but   gentleman jim   is a lot more fun             that this movie has been stapled to the wall of a chapel as proof that god is truly dead  am i the only one that really saw  rather sleptwalked  through this   film    this is the only movie i  ve ever seen in the theater that i regret not walking out on and demanding my money back    it was just that dull  and i even saw   highlander    the quickening   at the local cinema  from beginning to end  gibson and downey have absolutely no chemistry as two unlikelies  cast together by circumstance  who eventually work together as best buddies  the action  what little there is  is goofy and as dull as the skullbone of the writer  thank whatever deity is chortling down at us as it observes our   cinema   that there  s no chance for an   air america                 well  there  s no real plot to speak of  it  s just an excuse to show some scenes of extreme violence and gratuitous sex  which can sometimes be fun  too  but it  s not in this case   what else can i say about this     the action  when happening  is inventive and there  s a cool scene where two characters are falling from a skyscraper  one that has to be several miles high   but overall there  s not much to recommend   kite    watch it if you want  but you  re not missing much if you skip this one               this is the best film the derek couple has ever made and if you think this is a recommendation then you haven  t seen any of the others  there are the usual ingredients  it is just as poorly acted as their other efforts  we can watch bo disrobing or auditioning for wet t shirt contests quite frequently  the story is just laughably idiotic  and the film takes itself much too seriously  and then  orang utans in africa  br    br   but it has a few things going for it  bo looks great  the production values  sets  costumes  etc   are quite good  and this greatly enhances its camp value  in a strange way it is actually quite funny  simply because it tries to be serious and fails so badly             some people drift through life  moving from one thing or one person to the next without batting an eye  others latch on to a cause  another person or a principle and remain adamant  committed to whatever it is   and figuratively or literally they give their word and stand by it  but we  re all different   made of different clay    as one of the characters in this film puts it  which is what makes life so interesting  some people are just plain crazy  though   and maybe that  s the way you have to be to live among the masses  who knows  who knows what it takes to make things   life   work  writer director lisa krueger takes a shot at it  using a light approach to examine that thin line between being committed   and how one  gets   committed   and obsession  in  committed    starring heather graham as a young woman who is adamant  committed  obsessive and maybe just a little bit crazy  too  her name is joline  and this is her story  br    br       admittedly  joline has always been a committed person  in work  relationships  in life in general  she s a woman of her word who sticks by it no matter what  and when she marries carl  luke wilson   it s forever  the only problem is  someone forgot to tell carl   and     days into the marriage  he s gone  off to  find  himself and figure it all out  when joline realizes he s not coming back  she refuses to give up on him  or their marriage  maybe it s because of that  clay  she s made of  regardless  she leaves their home in new york city and sets off to find him  which she does   in el paso  texas  of all places  but once she knows where he is  she keeps her distance  giving him his  space  and not even letting him know she s there  she considers carl as being in a  spiritual coma   and it s her job to keep a  spiritual vigil  over him until he comes to his senses  and while she watches and waits  her life is anything but dull  as she encounters a young woman named carmen  patricia velazquez   a waitress at one of the local eateries  carmen s  grampy    alfonso arau   who is something of a mystic  t bo  mark ruffalo   a truck driver who has issues concerning carl  and neil  goran visnjic  an artist who makes pinatas and takes a fancy to her  for joline  it s a journey of discovery  during which she learns a lot about carl  but even more about herself  br    br       there s a touch of humor  a touch of romance  and some insights into human nature in this quirky film that is more about characterization and character than plot  and krueger presents it all extremely well  delivering a film that is engaging and entertaining  her characters are very real people  with all the wants  needs and imperfections that make up the human condition  a rich and eclectic bunch through which she tells her story  we see it from joline s point of view  as krueger makes us privy to joline s thoughts and therefore her motivations  which puts a decided perspective on the events as they unfold  that  along with the deliberate pace she sets that allows you to soak up the atmosphere and the ambiance she creates  makes for a very effective piece of storytelling  there s an underlying seriousness to this subject matter  but krueger chooses to avoid anything heavy handed or too deep and concentrates instead on the natural humor that evolves from the people and situations that joline encounters  and the result is a well textured  affecting and upbeat look at that thing we call life  br    br       heather graham takes hold of this role from the first frame of the film to make joline a character totally of her own creation  she immerses herself in the part and gives a performance that is convincing and believable  adding the little personal traits and nuance that makes all the difference between a portrayal that is a mere representation of a person  and one that is real  and for this film to work  it was imperative that joline be viable and believable   and graham succeeds on all fronts  her screen presence has never been more alluring  and her vibrant personality or even just the way she uses her eyes  is enough to draw you in entirely  it s all a part of the character she creates  there s an appeal to joline that exudes from her entire countenance  who she is inside and out  she s a likable  agreeable person  and because you ve shared her innermost thoughts  you know who she is  it s a good job all the way around  beginning with the way the character was written  to the way graham brings her so vibrantly to life  br    br       as carmen  patricia velazquez is totally engaging  as well  her performance is very natural and straightforward  and she uses her instincts to effectively create her character  she has a charismatic presence  but is less than flamboyant  and it gives her an aspect that is attractively down to earth  she is refreshingly open and up front  you get the impression that carmen is not one to hold anything back  but is totally honest on all fronts  and that  too  is part of her appeal  and  as with joline  this character is well written  and velazquez brings her convincingly to life  br    br       overall  there is a number of notable performances that are the heart and soul of this film  including those of luke wilson  casey affleck  as joline s brother  jay   goran visnjic  alfonso arau and especially mark ruffalo as t bo  who  with very little actual screen time  manages to create a memorable character  br    br       the supporting cast includes kim dickens  jenny   clea du vall  mimi   summer phoenix  meg   art alexakis  new york car thief   dylan baker  carl  s editor   and mary kay place  psychiatrist   a film that says something about the value of stepping back to consider the big picture   reflecting upon who we are  where we  re going and what we really need    committed   is an enjoyable experience  a ride definitely worth taking                   ho hum  an inventor  s horst buchholz deadly biological weapon is in danger of falling into the wrong hands  unknowingly his son luke perry has been working on the antedote all along  enter cia agent olivia d  abo and the cat and mouse car chases and gunfire begins  also in the cast are tom conti  hendrick haese and an aging roger moore  moore seems to haggardly move through this mess definitely not one of his better efforts  perry fans will be accepting  d  abo is wrong for the role  but nice to look at             note to self  never ever ever again watch a serious movie with charlie sheen in it  great comedian  horrible seal  this movie makes navy seals look like a reckless group of rangers when  in fact  they are the most elite form of military in the world  charlie sheen helps destroy the navy seal reputation  thank you for making such an incredibly select group of individuals look awful in one of the worst action movies i have ever seen  this is a great story which could be made into an amazing action movie  but why charlie sheen  there are possibilities for a very passionate story here  but sheen decides to wreck them with   funny   comments             this movie is stupid  there  s no getting around it  but so is dumb and dumber  mind you  dumb and dumber is significantly more funny than this  however  i for one love seeing stupid movies  tail sting  and laughing with a group of good friends over how bad it is  call me callous  but see this movie  and you  ll find that the only way you can laugh at it is if you laugh at it instead of with it             i was looking forward to this so much  being a big fan of the book  however  when it came out i remember thinking it was one of the biggest wastes of money and time i  ve ever spent at the cinema  br    br   in principle  the acting  the sets and the music were excellent  and are the main reason why i  m rating this a    br    br   in this version  sara is a little too self sacrificing for my taste  there is no way she would have deliberately lied to miss minchin just to stop her punishing the other girls  in the book she makes a point of describing lies as   not just wicked  but vulgar     br    br   there  s also far too much of a disneyfied ending for me  sara  s father coming back from the dead and all of them trotting off into the indian sunset  while the book does have a happy  and critics might say equally improbable  ending  it doesn  t leave you thinking    oh puh leeze    br    br   about the only things true to the book were  br    br      sara  s father being a soldier    the lines between sara and her father    are you learning me by heart      no  i know you by heart  you are inside my heart        sara  s friendship with becky  and her   adopting   lottie  although this last one wasn  t developed as much as it could have been     the changing of her room by adding various luxury items  that part was brilliantly done     the basic core   a rich girl being flung into poverty suddenly   is there  but that  s about all that is  br    br   people might say that this adaptation is more for the younger audience  possibly  all i can say to that is i have two cousins   aged   and    respectively   who were big fans of this film until they read the book  br    br   if all you want is a   feel good   family film  then this delivers  if you  re looking for a film that actually tells the story of a little princess  in fact  if you  ve read the book  don  t waste time with this one  it  s such a shame  with a cast like this  if they  d stuck to at least the basic story it could have been fantastic  br    br   am i harping on about   read the book   this and   read the book   that a little too much  very probably  but if someone attempts to adapt a book   especially such a classic   into a movie  then they should at least have done the same thing  preferably more than once             as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless  tv told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early     s and made everyone look bad  and claimed we all made over      a day when        a day was much closer to reality  when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work  and offered me work  i actually went and took the work if i was physically able and if i would been offered the          id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least   years  and kept most in the bank and still left myself           for nl      and      cash games at the casinos  i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll  instead i win about       a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all  i was only homeless cause i didn  t wanna risk spending all my money and going broke  sometimes i had over            in my sock while i slept outside  anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard     on yahoo messenger i admit i was different than most homeless people though  due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs  im no longer homeless  am now in govt housing for      a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning at online poker  mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi  glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping  worrying about getting caught by security are finally over  had this tv crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner  its a shame how they don  t better select who they pick             i really in enjoyed watching this movie  like most of the people that watched it  i wasn  t sure that i was getting  whoopi goldberg is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies  i e  sister act  br    br   however this was not really comedy  it is a drama with comedic moments  so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep looking  br    br   this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood  i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie  this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks  but also about relations with in the black community  i do think that it is worth a chance  if your not really interested in see another movie about race relations then this movie isn  t for you            having been a marine  i can tell you that the d i  is as accurate a portrayal to date depicting marine corp boot camp and how boys are turned into men  jack webb is excellent as sgt jim moore  a tough  but fair drill instructor in paris island north carolina  the film centers on one recruit who doesn  t seem to   get with the program    a more recent film  full metal jacket  also shows life in basic training and is well worth viewing             every high praise word fell way short before the height of this movie  this movie is the true example of how a psychological horror movie should be  br    br   the plot seems to be a bit confusing at first viewing but it will definitely explain a bit about what  s going on and you really want to view it for the second time  but after second viewing you will start to join the pieces together and then you will know how amazing a movie can be  br    br   a word of advice for slasher flick fans stay away from this movie  this is not your dumb ass teenage slasher movie  in which you just switch off your brain and sit in front of the screen just to see big b  bs and lots of blood  br    br   if you want to heighten the psychological horror factor of this movie then watch it all alone with a great home theater system that supports dolby digital or dts    ch  without any of your ill mannered friends that crack jokes on a really tense situation  and don  t forget to switch the light off  br    br   my points on different aspects   br    br   direction        acting        atmosphere         sound effect        br    br   total                   ken burns     baseball   is a decent documentary    it presents a clear origin of the game  a great depiction of baseball  s early years and heroes  there  s plenty in this movie for any baseball fan    that said  the film has several glaring flaws  br    br      hours is simply too long for the human attention span  it  s clear that burns stretched his film out to fit his   nine inning   concept  it  s not even a tight    hours    the pace on every segment is slow  almost morose    the music always nostalgic and wistful  isn  t baseball ever exciting and fun  why is every player and their accomplishments presented in the form of a tragedy  talking head after talking head turn every pitch into an emotional heartbreak  yakking about baseball as a metaphor  baseball as americana  the psychology and theology of baseball    enough  this is syrupy  mawkish drivel  billy crystal is here to sell us all the yankee hokum he  s sold us before  ken burns uses the national anthem as the series   theme song  and manages to play   take me out to the ballgame   so many times you might vomit  we get it  dude  br    br   clearly burns is a neo hollywood faux liberal  so he spends probably a third of the film on the negro leagues    these segments are spent chastising whites of yesterday for not being as open minded as kenny is today  for shame  he chides baseball for being segregated in the thirties and forties but fails to realize that america was segregated in those times  burns falls head over heels in love with buck o  neil  a former negro league player  and drools over every piece of footage in which the elderly o  neil waxes poetic about his playing days  nonsense    br    br   burns would have been better off with an adult to help him edit his creation down    baseball   winds up as mushy  gushy  civil rights propaganda disguised as americana  its clear that burns is not a baseball fan    otherwise he would know we watch games laughing and cheering  not weeping and reciting soliloquies    are you listening  mr  burns  there  s no crying in baseball               quitting   may be as much about exiting a pre ordained identity as about drug withdrawal  as a rural guy coming to beijing  class and success must have struck this young artist face on as an appeal to separate from his roots and far surpass his peasant parents   acting success  troubles arise  however  when the new man is too new  when it demands too big a departure from family  history  nature  and personal identity  the ensuing splits  and confusion between the imaginary and the real and the dissonance between the ordinary and the heroic are the stuff of a gut check on the one hand or a complete escape from self on the other  hongshen slips into the latter and his long and lonely road back to self can be grim  br    br   but what an exceptionally convincing particularity  honesty  and sensuousness director zhang yang  and his actors  bring to this journey  no clich  s  no stereotypes  no rigid gender roles  no requisite sex  romance or violence scenes  no requisite street language and  to boot  no assumed money to float character acts and whims   br    br   hongshen jia is in his mid twenties  he  s a talented actor  impressionable  vain  idealistic  and perhaps emotionally starved  the perfect recipe for his enablers  soon he  s the   cool   actor  idolized by youth    he was hot in the early nineties      he always had to be the most fashionable    he needs extremes  and goes in for heavy metal  adopts earrings and a scarf  his acting means the arts  friends  and roles  but not the kind that offer any personal challenge or input  and his self criticism  dulled by the immediacy of success  opens the doors to an irrational self doubt  self hatred     i didn  t know how to act     i felt like a phony    and to readily available drugs to counter them  he says   i had to get high to do what director wanted    so  his shallow identity as an actor becomes  via drugs  an escape from identity   br    br   hongshen  s disengagement from drugs and his false life is very gradual  intermittent  and doggedly his own  solitude  space  meditative thinking  speech refusal  replace therapy  the abstract is out  and a great deal of his change occurs outdoors   not in idealized locations but mainly on green patches under the freeways  bridges  and high rises of beijing  the physicality is almost romantic  but is not  the bike rides to ritan park  the long spontaneous walks  the drenching sun and rain  grassy picnics  the sky patterns and kites that absorb his musing are very specific  he drifts in order to arrive  all the while picking up cues to a more real and realistic identity    i started to open up   he says of this period in retrospect  and the contact seems to start with his lanky body which projects a kind of dancer  s positioning  clumsy  graceful  humorous  telling  in a current circumstance  if mind or spirit is lacking  his legs can compel him to walk all night   br    br   central to his comeback is the rejection of set roles  to punctuate his end to acting and his determination to a new identity  he smashes his videos and tv  and bangs his head till bloody against his   john lennon forever   poster  he has let down his iconic anti establishment artist   but he  s the only viable guide he knows  he even imagines himself as john  s son  yoko ono   and adopts his   mother mary   as an intercessor in his   hour of darkness   and   time of trouble     the wrenching  shaking pain in the park  hallucinatory and skitzoid ordeals    music is so much more real than acting   he says  and speaks of lennon  s influence as   showing me a new way    in the mental institute  the life saving apples  resistance  nourishment  reflect lennon  s presence  as does hongshen  s need to re hang his hero  s poster in his redecorated room  br    br   if lennon  s influence is spiriting  hongshen  s father  s influence is grounding  although father and son are both actors and users  drugs and drink   it is fegsen  s differences from his son that underwrites his change  for the father is more secure in himself  he accepts that he  s chinese  a peasant in a line of peasants  a rural theater director  and he exercises control over both his habit and his emotions  it  s this recognizable identity that drives hongshen to treat him like a sounding board  sometimes with anger and rage  sometimes with humor  the blue jeans  beatles  and passivity  in his most crazed  and violent exchange with his father in which he accuses him of being a liar  and a fake  he exposes more of himself than his father    all the acts i acted before were bullshit    life

musician buddy  hongshen says of this movie    it  s a good chance to think about my life    and i might add  become a new actor  one bound to art and life  like lennon  he has gained success without a loss of identity             i have watched this movie countless times  and never failed to be charmed by it  s homely simplicity  sincerity and goodness  great characterizations by all of the cast  and the lovely little steam trains that play a such an important supporting role i confess i fell in love with roberta in       and she still touches me today  shown on tv in new zealand on christmas day  the nicest present i could have had             if only i had read the review by alex sander  sic  on here rather than looking at the rating of over   from a select choice of the ignorant viewing public i would not have seen this desecration  alien was a fantastic  dramatic and well made horror sci fi  predator was a great sci fi action mess about  i do really have only myself to blame though as i saw   alien versus predator    it too has an average grading of over   stars from the connoisseurs of film that frequent this site  br    br   stop reading now if you have any fear of this ever so suspense ridden plot being ruined for you  br    br   right from the beginning this film was ridiculous  no explanation was offered for the predator ship overrun not overrun by aliens  ok so maybe they were again going to throw aliens down to earth to hunt them and something went wrong but how did this result in an alien predator hybrid and why did the rest of the crew not realise sooner despite their great technology  the start was actually the most coherent and interesting part of the film because we had some idea of who was who or what was what and perhaps why  from then on it gets really ridiculous  i always leave my disbelief strictly suspended above the door of the screen before entering and collect it on the way out  i couldn  t here  br    br   a father and son are hunting in the woods  the damaged ship crash lands to  from the view given  i would calculate at the very least    odd miles away through thick woodland  the man and boy track there alone and find the ship and get face hugged  even at this point you feel very little for them mainly because the face huggers are almost comical rather than scary in their movement and actions and the father seems like such an irresponsible  dumb redneck muppet  br    br   an edgy  thriller type scenario is introduced with an ex con returning to the town near the crash site to be met by his somewhat emotionless  dull now cop friend from the bus  when i say introduced i mean a feeble attempt with crap actors and no feeling is played out  a slasher horror element is then introduced with a sexy girl and the usual supposedly nerdy or somehow undesirable cute guy who gets beaten up by the over protective  crazy  nasty jock type  american sportsman not a scottish man   oh the cute not cute boy is the ex con  s brother by the way  yes they  re clever these director brothers whose name i will research in order to avoid any other shite they put out again  then a modern role reversal oh so boring attempt at pc  ripley credential type character introduction comes with a female soldier returning home to her husband and child  br    br   guess what happens next  i won  t tell you much more about the actual  smiles sadly to himself about the demise of storytelling in the large majority of recent films  plot just in case you have got this far and are not the brightest star in the alien ridden universe  br    br   the predator is stupid for the reasons stated by the previous poster whose post i read too late  the aliens are boring  the predator alien is ridiculous  the action is at times exploitative  gratuitous  disgusting nonsense  the hospital scene with the pregnant mothers     oh i was shocked alright  shocked at how low some people will go to get what  a scare  some shock  to titillate the perverse  what  if you really wanted to shock  titillate and scare people who are not pregnant or expecting fathers or who have no souls why not just have the alien predator shagging the saucy women and teenage girls rather than killing them  the characters have no depth and neither does the plot  it  s filmed and paced badly  it  s acted by disinterested people not that i can blame them  it further tarnishes two rather interesting and good sets of sci fi characters  this film was rubbish and if you gain enjoyment from it i really have to worry about you  if you haven  t seen it then well please make your own decision  br    br   ps did i even mention the way that trained soldiers are all killed in about    seconds while amateur civilians survive throughout             even though i saw this film when i was very young  i already knew the story of wild the thief taker and shepherd who famously escaped from newgate prison  br    br   apart from the liberty taken right at the end  the film more or less faithfully follows the true story  the temptation to bend the facts which is the hallmark of so many so called historical films is resisted in this film and the film makers must be praised for that  br    br   of the performances  there is scarcely a poor performance  and tommy steele is ideally cast  also good is stanley baker as the thief taker and alan badel is good as always  br    br   because the film sticks to the facts  it makes it suitable to be watched by all the family             gone is the wonderful campiness of the original  in place is a c grade action no brainer  wich is not all bad  but pales in comparison to the original  all the meaningless sex and violence is gone  and replaced with crappy jokes and unexplained plot pointers  see it  but don  t expect the thrills of the first             although most americans have little knowledge of his work other than star wars  alec guinness produced an amazing body of work  particularly in the     s     s  ranging from dramas to quirky comedies  i particularly love his comedies  as they are so well done and seem so natural and real on the screen  far different from the usual fare from hollywood  br    br   this being said  this was the film that sparked my interest in these movies  it  s plot was so odd and cute that it is very unlikely the film would have been made anywhere  except for ealing studios  which had a particular fondness for   little   films like this one  br    br   guinness is a nerdy little scientist that works for a textile company  he wants to experiment in order to create a synthetic fabric that is indestructible  though he is not working for the company as a researcher but for janitorial work  so  he tends to sneak into labs  either during the day if no one suspects or at night  and try his hand at inventing  repeatedly  he is caught  such as after he blew up the lab  and given the boot until one day he actually succeeds  then  despite the importance of the discovery  he sets off a completely unanticipated chain of events  and then the fun begins  br    br   the film is a wonderful satire that pokes fun at industry  unions  the government and people in general             victor mclaglen  s performance is one of the finest in film history  br    br   i think we can all feel for   gypo   because we  ve all struggled with what is right and what isn  t and been wrong  this was one of the first art house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio  rko radio pictures   br    br   joseph h  august  s cinematography is at its very best here  however  august  s stunning portion was mostly overlooked  he didn  t receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved  br    br   this is a psychological drama  with thought  philosophy  sadness  all conveyed with as little words as possible             how do you take a cast of experienced  well known actors  and put together such a stupid movie  nimrod antel has the answer  armored  six co workers at an armored car business decide to steal a large shipment of cash themselves  but  just as they get to first base with their plans  everything unravels quickly  with a plot like this  you  d think it couldn  t be too bad  at least for an action movie  however  in the first    minutes or more of this movie we see what appear to be   normal  everyday kind of guys  they joke  they laugh  have a few drinks together  etc  then  we suddenly learn they  re planning to rob their own business  the hero ty   columbus short   is sucked into the scheme because of the cold  cruel world  even though he  s a decorated veteran  nice guy  and reliable employee  oh my  oh my  then in the last    minutes of the film  these former regular guys nearly all turn into money crazed psychos  willing to butcher each other for cash  in the last scenes mike   matt dillon   goes on a suicidal rampage for no other reason than to kill his former friend  the viewer has no hint before this ending that these men are this ruthless and bloodthirsty  it  s utterly unbelievable and   b movie   is almost too kind for this sort of cheesy plot  i would say don  t waste your time  too bad no one gave laurence fishburne  jean reno or fred ward the same advice before making this picture             the sexploitation movie era of the late sixties and early seventies began with the allowance of gratuitous nudity in mainstream films and ended with the legalization of hardcore porn  it  s peak years were between      and       one of the most loved and talented actresses of the era was monica gayle  who had a small but fanatic cult of followers  she was actually able to act  unlike many who filled the lead roles of these flicks  and her subsequent credits proved it  and her seemingly deliberate fade into obscurity right when her career was taking off only heightens her mystique  br    br   gary graver  the director  was also a talent  probably too talented for the sexploitation genre  and his skill  combined with monica gayle  s screen presence  makes sandra  the making of a woman  a pleasantly enjoyable experience  the film never drags and you won  t have your finger pressed on the fast forward button             what a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be  this is the type of film that i  ve been looking for ages  particularly important for me was the fantastic looking chicago  which i still keep thinking about  the back cover doesn  t do this film justice  it  s superb  and in my top   for sure             i did not expect much from this film  but boy o boy  i did not expect the movie to be this bad  chris rock is not showing a good act here  you can  t get the feeling that his caracter is real  i think the movie would have been a bit better if it  s drama or romantic scenes would have been a less part of the movie and more better humor was involved  the movie is like the film makers were having a bad hangover making it  in the   making of   they don  t show a single smile  this is a very bad film  i gave it three out of ten because of few smiles it gave me  but i did never laugh             i cant believe there are people out there that did not like this movie  i thought it was the funniest movie i had ever seen  it my have been b c i am mel brooks biggest fan    i know almost all the words and get very discouraged when they censor them  when it is played on a family channel     this is one of my favorite movies  so i dont know why any one would disagree  thanks kristina            flynn  known mostly for his swashbuckling roles  and his bedroom antics   takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully  playing real life boxing champ jim corbett  flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist  all the while setting one eye on society deb smith  he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men  and a dog   including a prominent judge  the next day  he gets a chance  via smith  to gain entrance to the judge  s private club  he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club  s resident boxer  his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers  up to and including the world champion john l  sullivan  bond   flynn is downright magical here  he is the epitome of charm  charisma and appeal in this role  he looks terrific  especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit  and does virtually all of his own stuntwork  impressively   his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally  smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn  at this stage  he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation  he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time  and she does so admirably  she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude  yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell  bond is incredibly burly  brawny and towering  yet tender when the script calls for it  amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson  frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn  s manager  the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn  s rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types  the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed  a few of the sets are amazingly presented  some of smith  s gowns border on the garish  but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well  it  s a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing  but it  s also so much more  some of it  like the character traits shown by flynn  is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes  but a lot of it is authentic  like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes   one line is particularly memorable    i believe you like me more than i like you  but it  s entirely possible that i love you more than you love me    it  s classic romantic dialogue  and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well              often laugh out loud funny play on sex  family  and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it  s seen since the days of granny and jed clampett  plot centers on two chauffers who  ve bet on which one of them can bed his employer  both single or soon to be single ladies  quite sexy    bisset and woronov  first  if manuel wins  his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang    if he loses  he must play bottom man to his friend   br    br   lots of raunchy dialogue  fairly sick physical humour  etc  but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface  bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy  teenaged niece on a year long   missionary trip   to africa  br    br   hilarious fun             thought provoking  humbling depiction of the human tragedies of war  a small  but altruistic view of one family  s interactions with the enemy during the civil war in kentucky  this movie lessens the   glamor   of war  showing it  s effect on not only the soldier but the entire family unit  br    br   a lot of today  s movies show war as an opportunity to highlight the   hero  s   and other glamorous features of war  but very little attempts to show the true effect war actually takes on a community  this movie attempts this through a retelling of a person  s memory of those days  this movie is stated to be loose translation of an actual events  when in reality  this movie is probably a factual reality of hundreds  perhaps thousands of   actual events   during the civil war  i highly recommend those interested in our civil war to watch this movie             or anyone else have noticed the fact that first bunch of episodes are inspired too much by     s flicks  br    br   i mean seriously wife who is trying get someone else to murder his rich husband so she can claim his assets  med students who are temporarily stopping their hearts to reach memories that are lost  flatliners  bunch of college bodies getting together again to reminisce on the old days but are not fully comfortable because they did something in the past  very bad things  groundhog day is one of my all time favorite movies  sadly enough the writing staff behind his turd is bunch of lazy bastards who can not come up with their original scripts  br    br   noble idea totally fubarred in it  s execution             elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies  it has every thing you would want in a film  like great one liners  sexy star and a outrageous story  if you have not seen it  you are missing out on one of the greatest films made  i can  t wait till her new movie comes out             i saw this movie on the hallmark channel and thought it was wonderful  especially since it was based on a true man  pierce brosnan was very good as the loner english man who took on the persona of the half breed grey owl  the photography was beautiful  br    br   this movie made me do more research into this character archie belaney known simple as grey owl  i want to read as much as i can about him  at the time i did not know richard attenborough had directed it  but i am not surprised  i like all his movies whether he is acting or directing  i gave it the highest rating  however  i would have liked to have seen more in the movie about why he took on this persona as it only showed the two aunts who raised him and his room in their house  br    br   you can  t go wrong with this movie if you are like me and enjoy a beautiful story without hearing foul language and contrived special effects every few minutes             despite having an absolutely horrid script  more about that later   this film is still vaguely watchable just because it stars two excellent actors  barbara stanwyck and henry fonda  aside from one or two real stinkers  i  d probably watch just about anything with them in the film  as i am a huge fan of hollywood  s golden age of the     s and   s  however  no matter how much i love their films  i just can  t recommend this film  br    br   the movie begins with fonda and stanwyck on vacation at some ski resort  the two haven  t yet met  but the film begins loudly and obnoxiously with a scene in which fonda horribly yodels while skiing  it was done so unsubtly and made my teeth grind but i stuck it out  especially when fonda fell into a snow bank and this stopped the yodeling   in hindsight  perhaps i should have just turned it off then  fonda is knocked out in the fall and barbara goes for help  back at the ski lodge  he seems okay but fortunately she is also a doctor and has him x rayed and nurses him back to health  he  in turn  becomes infatuated with her and proposes to her  despite hardly knowing each other  they marry and so far the film seems like a sweet but very slight romantic comedy  br    br   once home  however  all isn  t rosy as she jumps right back into her job as a family doctor and he begins exhibiting signs that he is a controlling and potentially dangerous man due to his jealousy  the film plays it all for laughs  but frankly fonda  s behaviors were really creepy  spying on her and her male patients  attacking or threatening any man she treats  tripping a patient who already has a back injury and stomping into a surprise party and insisting that everyone there  men and women  are out to steal away his wife  he comes off as a combination of a sociopath and paranoid schizophrenic  but it  s all supposed to be for laughs  considering that he seems like a dangerous nut  you would think that stanwyck would file for an annulment along with a restraining order  but  oddly  she gets mad but just can  t stay mad at fonda because he  s so          i can  t think of the right word    creepy   is all that comes to mind    later  out of the blue  multi millionaire fonda gets a job working the counter at a department store  then  through magical thinking  he and babs seem to assume his hostility and violent jealousy is all a thing of the past  so a job apparently cures anger and suspicions  when this job falls through  the film ends with fonda buying his own hospital  giving barbara a job there and they live happily ever after  they don  t go any further with the story  but i assume based on fonda  s character that he then spent most of his time as hospital administrator beating up all the male patients  br    br   the first portion at the ski lodge and the next did not fit well together  nor did the final   horatio alger   inspired section where the rich boy made good in the business world  they were like three separate plots but despite this  the most serious problem with the film was its seeming to excuse away domestic violence and delusional jealousy  what a creepy little film  thank goodness neither fonda nor stanwyck are known for this yechy film but for all their other lovely films            i find the critique of many imdb users a little harsh and in many cases find that they crit the movie from a very professional viewpoint and not that of the guy on the street that wants to sit and watch something just to get away from it all  br    br   in this case however i have to say it was bad  i am a scifi junkie and there was nothing in this movie that grabbed me for even one second  br    br   there was no proper storyline  i may be an idiot but i still do not know where the government was that was so worried about these pieces  br    br   the pathetic attempt by the main character to put together these   pieces is scary  half the time the two pieces were already in place and he simply had to add the third  a   year old kid would have been able to put them together  br    br   this movie was bad  br    br   dominic           i was debating between this movie and      but chose inglourious basterds due to it  s amazingly high imdb rating  i must say now  what a disappointment  i expected a certain amount of gratuitous violence  but i also expected a lot of witty dialog  i got a huge dosage of the former  but not nearly enough of the latter  i felt shortchanged  the ratio between violence to plot is very important and i think this movie gets it totally wrong  and the plot  it  s that believable or really all that entertaining either  save your time and money  i can  t believe what this rating says for the gory and violent tastes of the modern masses             bend it like beckham is packed with intriguing scenes yet has an overall predictable stroy line  it is about a girl called jess who is trying to achieve her life long dream to become a famous soccer player and finally gets the chance when offered a position on a local team  there are so many boundaries and limits that she faces which hold her back yet she is still determined and strives  i would recommend it for anyone who likes a nice light movie and wants to get inspired by what people can achieve  the song choices are really good    hush my child  just move on up   to your destination and you make boundaries and complications    anyway hope that was at help to your needs in a review  bend it like beckham great flick            directed by diane keaton and adapted from a book by franz lidz  a young mother selma lidz andie macdowell is battling a very serious illness and her self proclaimed inventor husband sid john tururro is a little lacking in the emotions department  unhappy with the new home situation  their sensitive son steven nathan watt decides he wants to stay with his two eccentric uncles danny michael richards and melvin lou cutell until his mom is well  steven seems to be happier and even takes interest in his strange uncle  s living habits  he even decides he wants to change his name to franz  set in the early     s  this drama is a bit comedic   change that to zany  not being a macdowell fan  unstrung heroes assures my attitude  albeit i enjoyed the film and it is not a total waste             perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is otto preminger  s   where the sidewalks ends    from a really excellent script by ben hecht based on the novel   night cry   by frank rosenberg    br    br   dana andrews is the honest  tough new york policeman  always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong arm methods as much as he detests crooks    when he hit someone  his knuckles hurt    and the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain  gary merrill  who points up the title    why are you always trying to push me in the gutter    he asks andrews    i have as much right on the sidewalk as you    br    br   dana andrew  s obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden  painful discovery that he is the son of a thief    his deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them  and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta    br    br   by a twist of irony unique to the film itself  dana andrews and gene tierney of   laura   are united once more  and andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later  but no longer the romantic  beaten down by his job  by the cheap crooks    this time  he goes too far  and accidentally kills a suspect    the killing is accidental  the victim worthless  yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail    br    br   using his knowledge of police procedure  he covers up his part in the crime  plants false clues  and tries to implicate a gang leader  but cannot avoid investigating the case himself    the double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder  is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical  satisfying  and in no way a compromise    br    br   the film is one of the best detective films of the     s  with curious moral values  also one of preminger  s best     br    br   preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique  projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism               in sum  overlong and filled with more subplots than swiss cheese has holes  the director and co writer says he wanted to mix genres   in this case drama and comedy  well  at least here  these two mix like vinegar and oil  to boot  the comedy is not very funny and juvenile  additionally  the film is not really realistic  liberties are taken regarding the legal system in committing french citizens against their will and the apparent ease of absconding with drugs in french hospitals  i watched this film on my big screen tv at home and found myself shouting at the film to move on  eventually toward the end i fast forwarded the final long speech one of the main characters makes to his ex lover  s son  by that time i was worn out by the preposterous confused plot that deals with a dead lover  marriage of convenience and a nutty ex lover  at times the plot diverts to the families of the two main characters and then reverts back to one of them   either ismael or primarily nora  to the detriment of the audience  viewpoints keep changing from nora and ismael  her ex lover confined against his will in a psychiatric hospital  there probably are two potentially interesting films here neither of which are well developed  the epilogue does not really wrap up many of the sub plots and seems to want the viewer to believe nora somehow will find happiness although given her circumstances in real life the chances are equivalent to a snow ball  s chance in hell  the actors do their best and are appealing  but this is not enough to overcome all the glaring faults of poor writing  editing and lack of focus             incomprehensibly dreadful mishmash of the probably most notorious of all roman emperors who went insane  leaving infamous party orgies and ruthless killings in his path    i know there are several versions of this  and this is based on the     min   one that i watched   but i can  t fathom how that possibly can make any difference to lift the rest of this movie out of the muck  br    br   i  d heard for long about the alleged   shocking   content of sex nudity  which honestly there isn  t much of here at all   and boring when there is  and blood  but beware   it  s the technical production amateurishness that well and truly shocks here  everything looks plain and simply like a junior film school flunk project  camera work is hopelessly inept  full of strange zooms  failed framing and confusing pans  to and from what mostly looks like a huge theater stage   complete with a grainy  cheapish photo quality  lighting and color schemes are terrible and uneven   is it day or night  are they in  or outside  have they changed scenes  who is  or is meant to be in the shot  editing is the final sin here  making a confusing mess of everything with randomly jumpy cutaways  continuity flaws and random transitions that destroy any chance of momentum  story progression   and involvement  there is potentially interesting dialog and an equally interesting true historical story    but these faults distract so much it  s tragic  br    br   a story with so many possibilities to be great is just one gargantuan  burnt  and fellini like  turkey that  s only good for a few gobble laughs and peter o  toole  who makes a most memorable tiberius  oh yes  which brings us to the big name actors  i  d like to line them all up one by one and just ask  who did you get free access to bonk in the orgies to be a part of this  there  i  ve wasted enough lines on one of the truly worst films of all time   period  br    br     out of    from ozjeppe            did anyone edit this film  or was it only the dvd release that had huge thirty second gaps between scenes  it  s ok though  i fell asleep watching it the first time  then i fell asleep the second time and the third time  the plot is actually not the worst i  ve seen  but it  s close  the acting is not the worst i  ve seen either   but it  s close  the production      well  i can honestly say that it was the worst i had ever seen in my life  not trying to be spiteful  but unhinged could have used some more production  br    br   please don  t think i  m a hater of horror films  or even that i didn  t enjoy this film  i just felt i was laughing at the film much more than i felt i was laughing along with it  the gruesome moments were not too poorly done  but could have been done better even with a shoestring budget  br    br   characters seemed awkwardly developed  or ignored all together  twist ending was pretty bad  and the exposition took forever without exposing much  br    br   i  d recommend avoiding this movie  br    br                   riding high on the success of   rebel without a cause    came a tidal wave of   teen   movies  arguably this is one of the best  a very young mcarthur excels here as the not really too troubled teen  the story concentrates more on perceptions of delinquency  than any traumatic occurrence  the supporting cast is memorable  frankenheimer directs like an old pro  just a story of a young man that finds others take his actions much too seriously             most of the comments on this movie are positive so i thought i would try and redress the balance  i came out of this movie wondering what was going on  i now know and still consider it to be a poor movie  i intially discounted a dream sequence as that seemed too obvious  i was glad that i had a free ticket to the movie or i would have asked for my money back  movie reviewers and critics love this movie  which only confirms to me that most of them would rather sound intelligent than review how an audience may enjoy a film  the    rating this movie has is so misleading  in    years time this film will not compare to true greats such as the godfather  the film does have fine performances from both the leads but that isn  t enough to save the film   nor are the lesbian scenes              pepe le moko  played by charles boyer  is some sort of international criminal mastermind wanted in countries throughout europe  and to stay free he holes himself up in the casbah  a mysterious part of algiers where even the police are reluctant to go  until a senior officer is sent from paris to capture le moko once and for all  for le moko  although the casbah allows him to remain out of police custody  it also becomes a sort of prison at the same time   a place he can  t leave  because the moment he does  he knows he  ll be arrested  br    br   boyer  s performance was good  and i can understand why he was nominated for an oscar  he captures the essence of such a character   a perfect combination of very dangerous and yet very classy at the same time  the movie itself  unfortunately  was quite a letdown  a number of parts of the story seemed inconsistent  of which i  ll mention two  first was the idea that the police wouldn  t enter the casbah  that was stated pretty clearly at the beginning of the film by the local commander  and yet repeated references in the movie suggest that in fact the police did enter the casbah fairly regularly  so  neither the suggestion by commissioner janvier that the police wouldn  t enter  nor the statement by inspector slimane  also a decent performance by joseph calleia  that they could get into the casbah but not out seemed to make much sense  i also found it difficult to believe that le moko   hardened criminal mastermind that he was   could be so quickly swept off his feet by gaby  hedy lamarr  to the point where he entertains the local populace by singing love songs and then leaves the casbah to find her  essentially giving himself up  i understand the irony of the final few scenes  of course  as pepe leaves the freedom of his prison  the casbah  only to find real freedom in his capture  because he  s shot and killed by the police   i just found it impossible to believe that someone like le moko would fall into such a trap  br    br   this is worth watching for boyer  and to a lesser extent calleia  but the story is disappointing and inconsistent                  man with the screaming brain certainly isn  t a perfect movie  but i  m pretty sure it was never meant to be anything more than a star vehicle for bruce campbell  meaning it works as kind of a summary of his entire career  slapstick  sarcasm  cheese  action  and happy endings  campbell is  as a writer  uneven  there are lots of things in the story that don  t make a great deal of sense  why does the robot suddenly have breasts merely because a female brain has been implanted into it    and some of the scenes feel like retreads of other  better incarnations  the scene in the restaurant  where yegor and william battle for control of william  s body  is straight out of evil dead ii   there are  however  lots of little touches and non sequiturs that feel rather brilliant  such as when william is in the height of his panic and screams at a statue    what are you looking at     the movie looks like a sci fi channel original  probably because it was  the acting is actually pretty good  i particularly enjoyed tamara gorski as tatoya  she was ruthless and cunning  yes  but seemed to have a tragic air about her in certain moments that the story never explored  ted raimi handled the standard   bumbling assistant   role admirably enough  and bruce is funny as the arrogant  sardonic  condescending american jerk   now that he  s writing his own films  you  d think he  d give himself a role that he hasn  t been typecast in already   man with the screaming brain is a bizarre  nonsensical b movie that ought to be enjoyable for anybody who can avoid taking a cinematic experience too seriously             you should never ever even consider to watch this movie  it is absolutely awful  this isn  t an overstatement   it is so unbelievable and exaggerated  it gets boring  it is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one  they writer hasn  t been able to pull it off in a good way  br    br   if you  d like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you  but still  you should plug your ears and just watch  it  s not worth listening p there are so many great movies out there  and if i could choose one  this would be the last movie i would pick  but all in all  it  s your choice     br    br   enjoy             tell the truth i   m a bit stun to see all these positive review by so many people  which is also the main reason why i actually decide to see this movie  and after having seen it  i was really a disappointed  and this comes from the guy that loves this genre of movie  br    br   i   m surprise at this movie all completely     it is like a kid   s movie with nudity for absolutely no reason and it all involve little children cursing and swearing  i   m not at all righteous but this has really gone too far in my account  br    br   synopsis  the story about two guys got send to the big brother program for their reckless behavior  there they met up with one kids with boobs obsession and the other is a medieval freak  br    br   just the name it self is not really connected with the story at all  they are not being a role model and or do anything but to serve their time for what they have done  the story is very predictable  though expected  and the humor is lame  and haven   t we already seen the same characters  play by mc lovin     in so many other movies  like sasquatch gang    i think i laugh thrice and almost fell a sleep  br    br   well the casting was alright after all he is the one that produce the screenplay  and the acting is so so as expected when you   re watching this type of movie  and the direction  what do one expect  this is the same guy who brought us wet hot american summer  and that movie also sucks  but somehow he always managed to bring in some star to attract his horrendous movie  br    br   anyway i felt not total riff off but a completely waste of time  only the naked scenes seem to be the best part in the movie  can   t really see any point why i should recommend this to anyone  br    br   pros  elizabeth bank  two topless scenes  br    br   cons  not funny  dreadful story  nudity and kids do not mix together  br    br   rating          grade  f             this film held my interest enough to watch it several times  the plot has holes  but the lead performers make it work  br    br   catherine mary stewart  julia kerbridge   does a great job as a woman of    who has sacrificed everything else to become a physician  she worked years to earn the money to go to medical school  she is performing brilliantly in her residency and is just about to take her board exam and realize her dream  br    br   meanwhile  julia  s sister and brother in law are murdered and as the nearest living relative she is compelled to take in her niece amanda  arlen aguayo stewart  to avoid having her become a ward of the state  amanda is about   years old from her appearance  amanda is so traumatized from her parent  s murder that she has become mute  needless to say  julia  s    hour days get longer caring for amanda  br    br   rob lowe plays kevin finney  a charming neighbor man in their apartment building who works his way into the lives of julia and amanda  he is always there with a trick or a joke to help amanda deal with her distress  amanda really starts to warm up to kevin as the film progresses  perhaps more than to her aunt  julia starts to rely on kevin to take some of the load of caring for amanda as she attempts to handle her case load and prepare for her board examination  kevin is always there whenever some crisis erupts for julia  br    br   the chemistry between rob and catherine mary was great  you keep watching to see them get together before the end of the film  the chemistry between rob and arlen was good as well  arlen managed to convey quite a lot without the benefit of words  the plot had julia and amanda gradually warming up to each other  you can see them working out a relationship as the film progresses  br    br   we discover that julia  s sister and brother in law  the meyers  were involved in industrial espionage  they stole an extremely valuable prototype microchip from their employer  they had three associates who intended to share the proceeds of the theft  julia discovers that the meyers were planning to skip the country under assumed identities  the plot is unclear whether the meyers intended to double cross their associates or were themselves double crossed  br    br   in any case the meyers are murdered in their home by   of their former associates  the killers make no attempt to extract the location of the microchip from the meyers before killing them  the killers search the home and fail to find their prize  they leave a living witness to their crime  amanda  the killers then spend the remainder of the film making clumsy attempts to extract the microchip from julia and amanda who have no idea where the prize is located  eventually  the killers kidnap amanda in hopes she knows something about the microchip  s location  br    br   eventually julia discovers the truth about kevin  he is an investigator hired to recover the stolen microchip  after some rough moments in the relationship they manage to rescue amanda and dispatch the bad guys  the predictable ending has the three forming a family and moving happily into a future together  br    br   what struck me about the plot were major holes  kevin moves into the same apartment building as julia and amanda the day after the murder of the meyers  how does he know that the microchip is not already in the hands of the killers  the killers blithely leave fingerprints at the murder scene  with no concern for concealing their identity  the killer that pretends to be a psychiatrist is revealed to amanda by the remnants of red paint from the murder scene on his shoe soles  he was not shown in the murder scene at the start of the film  there are other weaknesses along these lines too numerous to mention  br    br   the film could have been a lot better if the script had been refined more before filming  filling in the plot holes would have added little expense and greatly improved the effort             like the previous poster  i am from northern vermont  and i was inclined to like this film  however  not since   red zone cuba   have i seen such a confusing plot  the things the people to bootleg make no sense  two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car  uhm  why  then they meet two others  and drive up at night in to the bad guy  s hideout in a luxury packard    wouldn  t just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense  then  parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch  the four fall asleep  when they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out  of course they  re spotted and shot at  losing some of their precious cargo in the process  then two of the smugglers put the whiskey in a boat and float it over the border  again  why  i am told by someone whose great uncle really did smuggle in the area  all one needed was to drive a vehicle that could outrun than the u s  canada border patrol  which back then had a fraction of the resources it has now   br    br   and don  t get me started on the last half hour  which made no sense whatsoever  br    br   the only good thing i can say about the film is that kris kristopherson has actually grown some charisma with the years            may contain spoilers  this movie was the worst movie ever  i couldn t even watch it all it was so bad  this film is actually worse than scarecrow slayer which is saying a whole lot  this was worse than terror toons which at least terror toons was funny at times  not even the gore in the film was good  the shootings were fake and the acting was worse  please do yourself a favor and skip this one  if you see it at the rental store then run the other way  there is nothing good about this film at all  if you want to see a good scarecrow movie then watch night of the scarecrow or pumpkin head  if you want to see an ok new cheesy movie then watch scarecrow  i rate this movie a     out of     that s how horrible this film really is  the worst movie ever            watched this last night and was bowled over by the heartfelt story line  the excellent character development  and the good karmic vibe emanating from the acting and movie as a whole  br    br   without giving away too much of the plot  it begins with an ordinary joe who commutes to his office job every day who becomes inspired to take dance lessons  along the way the protagonist and the assorted characters he meets in his quest to be smooth on the dance floor learn lessons about others and about themselves   br    br   the story has a prologue about what dancing in japan symbolizes sociologically  so it isn  t exactly as simple to learn to dance in japan as it is here in the u s   br    br   the film is lighthearted  you  ll laugh out loud at some of the sight gags  yet it is also dignified in a way hard to describe  all of the film  s characters are taken seriously  as they are  and none are diminished because of their   imperfections    br    br   i  ve been thinking about taking social dance classes with some friends  it just so happened a friend lent me the video on learning to dance  is this synchronous or what  i think so because now i  m really geeked to give it a try   br    br   watch this wonderful family film  small children might not get it  but teens certainly would  and smile at the genuine caring you see shown in it time and again  br    br   why they would make a remake of shall we dance is a mystery  as it is perfect as is             recap  something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica  the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica  julian rome  a former seti worker  is brought in to decipher the message  problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his  and the situation quickly turns awkward  especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him  and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly  soon the object is in the open  the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity  it is decided to open the object  but just before that is done  julian decodes the signal    do not open    but too late  and the object explodes as it is finally breached  and two things unleashed on earth  the first is an alien  that had been dormant in the object  and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff  and washington  that is suspiciously updated on this historic event  decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth  so a russian nuclear submarine  carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica  br    br   comments  the movie holds a few surprises  one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance  and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful  well worked through and a lot better than expected  unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own  and this time not in a good way  actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes  it is never really explained why washington know so much  why washington is able to command russian submarines  why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now  it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english  some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language  and obviously chose english  why    but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus  send their   do not open   message encoded  and finally the end is as open as an end can be  br    br   the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy  from me  must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot  therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good  br    br                   this movie features charlie spradling dancing in a strip club  beyond that  it features a truly bad script with dull  unrealistic dialogue  that it got as many positive votes suggests some people may be joking             had i checked imdb before renting this dvd from netflix  i  d have a couple of hours of my life back  i  m frankly suspicious when i see that a film  s director also wrote it  in this case  according to the credits  the same guy was   writter and director     unfortunately  an indication of the overall quality of this production  there were a few interesting moments  e g   judy tenuta  s scene reminded of her early comedy routines touting judy ism  which led me to rate this two stars rather than one  those moments  however  were few and far between     and i almost did not get to see them because the opening sequence was nearly incomprehensible to me  not to mention reprehensible in its violence  i admit i went back to watch that part again to see if i had missed something that would help me figure it out once i  d seen the whole thing  nope  though i at least recognized who the characters were who would turn out to be important later  the   spinning camera   technique was overused and essentially pointless  i found myself talking to the tv screen    what      or   for goodness sake  get on with it    not recommended             the endless bounds of our inhumanity to our own kind never fails to stun me  this truly astonishing story of a horrifically abused and largely unheard of population is compelling  well documented and enraging  as an american  i am constantly humiliated by my country  s behaviour and this is just another in our long catalogue of international debasement  we suck  this is probably the first john pilger documentary i  ve seen  but it immediately made me want to see what else he  s done  my only complaint  and the reason i gave this film only   out of     is that pilger shows us this travesty and the appalling collaboration of the us and uk governments  demands that we viewers citizens are complicit in our own inaction   but makes no suggestion of how to help  i don  t know about britain  but america  s made it nearly impossible for the citizenry to take part in their government  s doings  a gesture in the right direction might help these islanders   cause             this flick is so bad its beyond belief even for an independent low budget film   it just  well  sucks i can  t even believe even troma would put out such crap i have been a fan of some troma flicks for years toxic avenger squeeze play rockabilly vampire to name a few  but lloyd  come on this goes way beyond the boundaries of any taste it features some of the worst acting imaginable i think it would have been possible to find unemployed street people who could have been as good   oh wait  that is what they did i mean it these characters have negative charisma with any luck  the producer and director of this film will have a huge karmic debt because of this atrocity as will the special effects people but beyond the terrible acting and the horrid special effects the dialogue is absolutely traumatic to the ears the script is full of plot holes the size of alaska  and there are severe continuity problems the worst part however  is that it not entertaining in even the smallest way and this is the most unforgivable sin in film making but  don  t take my word for it go out and waste four bucks renting it just don  t say i didn  t warn you             this is a very memorable spaghetti western  it has a great storyline  interesting characters  and some very good acting  especially from rosalba neri  her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic  she steals every scene she is in  and expresses so much with her face and eyes  even when she  s not speaking  her performance is very believable  she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top  not that there  s anything wrong with being over the top   mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too  br    br   the music score is excellent  and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie  whether you want it to or not  there are a couple of parts that are very amusing  i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot  there  s also lots of slick gun play that  s very well done  br    br   i would probably have given this movie   or   stars if it wasn  t for two things  the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about    minutes into the film  this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie  it is very poorly choreographed  and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight  one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill bud spencer comedy  but this is a more serious western  and the brawl really needed to be more realistic  the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma  s cowardly mexican sidekick  i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something  but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this  and he wasn  t at all funny  all i can say is where is tuco when you need him   br    br   all that having been said  let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned  and all fans of the genre need to see this movie             the plot  michael linnett connors has done everything in films but direct  and is looking for his  st big chance  he discovers molly in a play and at once knows she will be a big film star  he signs her to a contract with the stipulation that he must direct  the producer agrees and their big time careers are under way  what follows is a recreation of the silent film era and early sound movies with great emphasis on comedy  and  oh yes  there  s romance  and a little sadness too  the performances by don ameche and alice fay are top notch  the music is a real plus too with some old familiar tunes heard  lots of dvd extras as well in this restored version released in       it must be emphasized that this movie is a story  st  not just a tribute to silent films  later years would bring similar films such as  singin   in the rain         dick van dyke carl reiner  s  the comic        what is special about this film  though  is recreating silent movies in       we see portions of them as the cinema audience would in that bygone era although some sound effects are included in glorious b w  while the rest of the movie is in pristine color  one of the greatest in the silent era  buster keaton  who at this point was on an uphill climb  is used superbly in   silent film recreated scenes and he is on the top of his game  it is said that he had some input on his scenes as well  but the real reason to watch the movie  if your a motion picture history fan  is that beyond everything else  hollywood cavalcade is mack sennett  s film legacy  it doesn  t take a genius to realize this movie is a   positive   reworking of mack sennett  s and mabel normand  s life  the character michael   linnett   connors is mack sennett  whose real name was michael sinnott  and molly  of course is mabel  sennett had the pie throwings  the bathing beauties and keystone cops  he worked with buster keaton  ben turpin cameo   roscoe   fatty   arbuckle body double  and fell in love with his leading lady  not only all that  but sennett was technical adviser for this film and appears in it as well  as most film viewers today prefer sound features  those who were associated with short subjects and silents are left out to pasture  as mack sennett fell into that category  it is fortunate that there is hollywood cavalcade  sennett was of course very instrumental in the evolution of comedy in movies  his career started in      as an actor  then writer  director   producer  he semi retired in      with about     films to his credit  he had worked with the best  such as charlie chaplin  gloria swanson  bing crosby  w c  fields  keaton  harry langdon  arbuckle  and even roy rogers in way up thar  as film comedy is an extremely difficult path to continue for an entire career  mack played it wise   did only selective work for the next    years  in      he had receive an academy award in the short subject category  and another in      for a lifetime of work  in the       s his presence was still felt  e g  here come the co eds      where a recreation of the oyster soup scene used in mack  s wandering willies      is done  in       the road to hollywood  used some of sennett  s crosby films    years later brought some nostalgia with the film down memory lane in which he participated  with his knack of always associating with the right people  a guest role with the eternally popular lawrence welk   his radio show came about later in the year       brought a re release of his greatest triumph  tillie  s punctured romance       with sound  in      he was honored on tv  s  this is your life  then his autobiography  the king of comedy        which is a great companion piece to hollywood cavalcade  was published       brought a more concrete association with abbott   costello  as he had a cameo in a c meet the keystone kops  finally in       another tribute with the compilation film  the golden age of comedy  so when you watch hollywood cavalcade it is the legacy of a motion picture pioneer  in the film at the banquet scene the camera pans over the guests at a long table  as we get to the silver haired mack  he alone turns his head to the camera as if to say    here i am     when he rises to give a speech a short while later  he is at his most subdued  underplaying the words given him as if to mentally convey    i know my influence on comedy will never end  but will people forget mack sennett the individual  maybe this movie will help               it got to be a running joke around bonanza about how fatal it was for any women to get involved with any cartwright men  after all ben cartwright was three times a widower with a son by each marriage  and any woman who got involved with adam  hoss  and little joe were going to end up dying because we couldn  t get rid of the formula of the widower and the three sons that started this classic tv western  br    br   perhaps if bonanza were being done today the writers would have had revolving women characters who came in and out of the lives of the cartwrights  people have relationships  some go good  some not so good  it  s just life  and we  re less demanding of our heroes today so if a relationship with one of them goes south we don  t have to kill the character off to keep the survivor  s nobility intact  but that  s if bonanza were done today  br    br   but we were still expecting a lot from our western heroes and bonanza though it took a while to take hold and a change of viewing time from nbc certainly helped  the secret of bonanza  s success was the noble patriarch ben cartwright and his stalwart sons  ben cartwright was the ideal tv dad in any genre you want to name  his whole life was spent in the hard work of building that immense ponderosa spread for his three children  the kids were all different in personality  but all came together in a pinch  br    br   the cartwrights became and still are an american institution  i daresay more people cared about this family than the kennedys  just the popularity that bonanza has in syndication testifies to that   br    br   pernell roberts as oldest son adam was written out of the show  rumor has it he didn  t care for the noble cartwright characters which he felt bordered on sanctimonious  perhaps if it were done now  he  d have liked it better in the way i describe  br    br   this was just the beginning for michael landon  how many people get three hit tv shows to their credit  landon also has highway to heaven and little house on the prarie where he had creative control  little joe was the youngest  most hot headed  but the most romantic of the cartwrights   br    br   when roberts left  the show kept going with the two younger sons  but when big dan blocker left  the heart went out of bonanza  other characters had been added on by that time  david canary  tim matheson  and ben cartwright adopted young mitch vogel  but big  loyal  but a little thick hoss was easily the most lovable of the cartwrights  his sudden demise after surgery left too big a hole in that family  br    br   so the cartwrights of the ponderosa have passed into history  i got a real taste of how america took the cartwrights to heart when i visited the real virginia city  it doesn  t look anything like what you see in bonanza  but near lake tahoe  just about where you see the ponderosa on the map at the opening credits  is the cartwright home  the set maintained and open as a tourist attraction  like    baker street for sherlock holmes fans  the ranchhouse and the cartwrights are real  br    br   and if they weren  t real  they should have been             years ago  when darling lili played on tv  it was always the pan and scan version  which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format  so when i saw an inexpensive dvd of this julie andrews blake edwards opus  i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all  br    br   boy  what a terrible film  it  s so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong  looking at it now  it  s obvious to any fans of movies that blake edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals  mary poppins  sound of music  thoroughly modern millie  etc  but also because andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself  camelot  my fair lady  etc  because hollywood thought she wasn  t sexy or glamorous enough  so blake created this stillborn effort  to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical  darling lili suffers from multiple personalities  never knowing who or what it is  some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole  it just doesn  t work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing  br    br   mind you  the version on the dvd is the   director  s cut    or in this case    let  s salvage whatever we can   from this notorious box office flop  in releasing the dvd  edwards cut    scenes              from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version  the film moves along with no idea of what it is  we are    minutes into it and we still don  t know what  s going on or why we  re watching what  s going  what kind of spy is lili  how powerful is she  was she ever responsible for someone  s death  instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews  things aren  t helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love  why does julie fall for hudson  why him and not other men she got involved with  there should have been one of her ex hanging around  trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret  this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action  it would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings  there  s no catalyst in this story  br    br   one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by andrews    and edwards    previous successes  the best  or worst  example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest  edwards channeling sound of music  it  s no wonder he removed it from the dvd  back in       that scene might have worked on a certain level but today  that moment reeks of desperation  there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews edwards other films  the endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better modern millie  the musical moment   i  ll give you three guesses   was created just to make fun of julie  s mary poppins persona  which is turned   raunchy   with julie doing a striptease in the act  the ending  bird  s eye view of julie running towards hudson  s plane  is another   wink   at sound of music  br    br   the whole thing is confusing  julie plays a singer  born from a german father and british mother  who lives in england but sings her  english  songs in paris  you never know exactly where the story takes place  some moments are just badly edited  like when julie and her   uncle   are on horseback  they talk and talk and then julie suddenly sprints off in mid sentence  i  m like   what happened here    br    br   the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy  every scene with the french police are pathetic  where  s peter sellers when you really need him  the action is stupid beyond belief  when julie and her   uncle   are on their way to germany on that train  hudson  s squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train  almost killing lili in the process  brilliant  what  s also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning  that  s one slow moving train there   br    br   the musical moments  the beginning is the best part of the entire film  and the reason i gave this film   stars  but it  s effect is diminished considerably because it  s repeated at the end  speaking of redundant  did we really need to see a can can dance  crepe suzette stripping scene and julie stripping too  the   girl in no man  s land   is ok even if it  s bleeding obvious  but that moment just doesn  t make any sense whatsoever because lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital  making me wonder  how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spying  br    br   the whole project is listless and without energy  the romance is      unbelievable  rock hudson is way too old and tired looking  check out the museum scene   julie looks dazed  like she  s on valium  but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy  edwards desperately wanted to dispel the mary poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision  as much as i like julie  she  s no greta garbo  who pulled it off so beautifully in mata hari  funny enough  even if julie plays a german spy  she still comes across as cloying and cute  br    br   how bad is darling lili  even after    years since its release  blake edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release             this series  made for televisi  n espa  ola  tve  is basically a series of chapters in the life of an ordinary family in       primarily as seen through the eyes of the youngest son  br    br   based on a background of historical events  such as the may      student uprising in france  the decaying franco regime  the war in viet nam  the rise of imperialism  and others specifically related to spanish life at that particular moment  one might regard this series as a simple compilation of characteristic foibles which make themselves so apparent in this kind of entertainment  br    br   generally treated in a lightweight vein though not lacking in certain moments which might be called dramatic  the series would seem to be aimed at people of around fifty who can rember those times  as  it should be stated  anyone younger either chooses to ignore such happenings or is busily occupied in other things  br    br   the best thing that can be said of this series is ana duato  s r  le as mother of three children  she plays the part of the total housewife of the times really well  manifesting that peculiar spanish penchant  especially noticeable among women  of letting all her thinking and her doings be carried forward by the impetus of her heart  without any resorting to the use of the brain  as we say in spain  common sense is one of the least common senses  imanol arias offers very little  apart from not being his usual stereotyped hard policeman as in other television series  indeed  as an actor  he should not be trusted in anything which is not a tv series  his resources are too limited  however  his part as father of the working class household is not at all bad  br    br   not really recommendable for other audiences  even spanish speakers in latin america  the themes are all too parochially related to a specific spot in contemporary spanish history  such that if the viewer was not living here at that time he will miss most of the references  it is even probable that certain situations which cause a few spanish smiles would not mean anything to other viewers             i want the    minutes of my life back that was wasted on this pathetic excuse for a movie  the acting was horrific  i used to be a fan of cameron diaz and vincent d  onofrio  i will never look at them the same again  keanu reeves and dan aykroyd were not a surprise  everyone knows they never could act  thankfully  only dan attempted an accent  his accent was a disaster as expected  i think he was either confused about the location of the film or had never actually spoken to anyone from minnesota  i hope this review helps anyone who is undecided about what to do with their precious time  the only reason i was able to sit through the whole movie was because i was stuck somewhere without anything better to watch or read             one of my favorite movies which has been overlooked by too many movie goers  an observation which mystifies me  not only directed by the acclaimed ang lee it had many young actors who were to become major stars  e g   tobey maguire  before spiderman   skeet ulrich  before jericho   jonathan rhys meyers  before tudors   james caviezel  simon baker  mark ruffalo  jeffrey wright  tom wilkinson  and jewel  all of the acting was superb and each of the actors mentioned gave memorable performances  especially meyers who portrayed an evil villain who killed for the sake of killing  br    br   when the biographies and accomplishments of the director   even when he won an academy award  and the actors are listed  this film is usually omitted from their past performances  i discovered the film on dvd by accident and it became one of my most often watched films  however  it is seldom every seen on cable  i look forward to reading what others suggest are the reasons this film is not well known             it  s nice to see a romantic comedy that does not have the prissy man lead  this has solid acting from both male leads and also from the female lead and although the story is a little long and a little clich   you cant help but like it  br    br   i think the story was a little rushed at the end  but extending that would have made the story even longer  superior to other romantic comedies such as     days with mr arrogant  and possibly tied with my tutor friend  br    br   it would make an interesting introduction to korean cinema  not as great as my sassy girl  but still good             of all the movies of the seventies  none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the sentinel  i mean  yes  there were movies like the exorcist  and other ones  but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one  if you have time  check this one out  you may not be able to get past the dated devices as such  but this is a story worth getting into then there are all the stars and soon to be stars  my absolute favorites were eli wallach  sylvia miles  and burgess meredith  then there are the subtle clues that lead to what  s going on too  pay close attention  i had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like   black and white cat  black and white cake    plus  the books are really good as well  i  m just sorry that they  re not going to turn the second book into a film  it  s so scary that it would outdo this movie             this is apparently the second remake of this film  having been filmed before in      and       and  in so many ways it reminds me of the later film  a yank at oxford  both films concern a conceited blow hard who arrives at one of the top schools in the world and both  ultimately  show the blow hard slowly learning about teamwork and decency  in this film  william haines is   tom brown   and his main rival    bob   is played by frances x  bushman  and  in a supporting role is jack pickford  always remembered as the brother of mary  of these three  pickford comes off the best  as the sympathetic loser who becomes tom  s pal  he actually has a few decent scenes as well as a dramatic moment just before the big game  all the standard clich  s are there and the movie  because it was done so many times before and since  offers few surprises  however  it is pleasant film and is enjoyable viewing  br    br   in my opinion  for a better silent college film  try harold lloyd  s the freshman  it  s football scenes are frankly more exciting and harold is far more likable and sympathetic than the annoying tom brown  the freshman is probably the best college picture you can find from the era  another reason why brown at harvard is a lesser picture is that william haines played essentially the same unlikable and bombastic character with the same plot again and again and again  such as in westpoint and the smart set  among others   and if you  ve seen one of these films  you  ve seen them all  well made  but certainly not original  and  because it is just a rehash of his other films  anyone giving the film a score of    is strongly advised to see these other films  br    br            i just checked and saw this this small film was the highest rated film on imdb from the        talk about over rated  there are dozens and dozens of better films  how this film got to be    is anyone  s guess             this movie illustrates like no other the state of the australian film industry and everything that  s holding it back  br    br   awesome talent  outstanding performances  particularly by victoria hill   but a let down in practically every other way  br    br   an   adaptation   of sorts  it brought nothing new to macbeth  no  setting it in present day australia is not enough   and essentially  completely failed to justify its existence  apart from  let  s face it  completely unnecessarily  paying homage to the original work  if there  s one body of work that has been done  and done and done and done   it  s shakespeare  s  so any adaptation  if it  s not to be a self indulgent and pointless exercise  needs to at least bring some new interpretation to the work  br    br   and that  s what this macbeth fails to do  as it was done  this film has no contemporary relevance whatsoever  it  s the same piece that we have seen countless  too many   times before  except with guns and in different outfits  br    br   apart from the fundamental blunder  no other way to put it  of keeping the original shakespearian dialogue  one of the more cringeful moments of the movie is the prolonged and incredibly boring slow motion shoot out towards the end  during which i completely tuned out  even though i was looking at the screen  i never thought i had a short attention span  but there you go  br    br   i suppose the movie succeeds on its own  very limited terms  but as australia continues to produce world class acting talent  its movie makers need to stop being proud of succeeding on limited terms  and actually set high enough standards to show that they respect for the kind of acting talent they work with  br    br   a shame  an absolute shame             owen loves his mamma   only he  d love her better six feet under in this dark  laugh out loud comedy that both stars and is directed by danny devito  with admirable assists from billy crystal and anne ramsey in the title role  br    br     throw momma from the train   is a terrific comedy  even if it isn  t a great film  it  s too shallow in parts  and the ending feels less organic than tacked on  but it  s a gut splitting ride most of the way  with crystal and devito employing great screen chemistry while working their own separate comic takes on the essence of being a struggling writer  devito is avid but untalented  crystal is blocked and bitter   br    br   crystal  s professor donner believes his ex wife stole his book  the unfortunately titled   hot fire    and can  t write more than the opening line of his next book  which doesn  t come easy  he teaches a creative writing class of budding mediocrities  including a middle aged woman who writes tom clancy type fiction but doesn  t know what that thing is the submarine captain speaks through  and an upholstery salesman who wants to write the story of his life  mr  pinsky is probably the funniest character for laughs per minutes on screen  an ascot wearing weirdo who sees literature as an excuse to write his opus        girls i  d like to pork    br    br   then there  s devito  s owen lift  who calls himself professor donner  s   star pupil   even though the teacher won  t read his work in class  owen is a somewhat unusual character to star in a movie  a man child in his late   s who lives with his overbearing mother  anne ramsey  who calls him   lardass   and other endearing sentiments  in any other movie  we  d be asked to feel sorry for owen  but   throw momma from the train   piles life  s cruelties onto this sad sack for laughs and expects us to go along  that  s one big reason why this film probably loses a lot of people  br    br   for those of us who enjoy the humor of this character  even identifying with him  and take the rest of what we see here as a lark  it  s not as big a stretch to go along with the bigger gambit this comedy takes  asking us to watch in amusement while owen enlists professor donner  s help in a plan to kill his mother  actually  he first goes to hawaii to kill donner  s hated ex  then tells the professor it  s his turn to kill mrs  lift    swapping murders   as seen in hitchcock  s   strangers on a train    br    br   as a director  devito not only complements his actors   performances with scene setting that places the accent on dialogue  he makes some bold visual statements  throwing in bits of amusing unreality to keep the audience on its toes  and away from taking things too seriously   br    br   also helping matters is writer stu silver  who keeps the laughs coming with his quotable patter    you got rats the size of oldsmobiles here      she  s not a woman   she  s the terminator      one little murder and i  m jack the ripper    those are all crystal  s words  but some of the funniest lines  which work only in context but absolutely kill  are devito  s and ramsey  s  apparently silver never wrote another screenplay after this  according to the imdb  and that  s a shame  because he had real talent for it  br    br   the best scene in this movie  when crystal meets ramsey  was actually used in its entirety as a theatrical   coming attraction   presentation  the only time i  ve seen a movie promoted that way  owen introduces the professor to his mother as   cousin patty    and when momma says he doesn  t have a cousin patty  panicky owen loses it    you lied to me    he yells out  slamming the professor  s forehead with a pan  br    br   of course  in reality the professor wouldn  t groan out something witty from the floor  but   throw momma from the train   works effectively at such moments  when playing its looney tunes vibe for all its worth  devito hasn  t disappeared from films  of course  but it  s a mystery why he hasn  t really followed up on the directorial promise of this movie  maybe it  s because  as   throw momma from the train  s lack of mainstream success shows  his kind of vision isn  t to everyone  s tastes  that  s too bad for those of us who can watch this over and over  and like it             a compelling thriller       december      author littlehammer      from united states br    br   just cause br    br   starring sean connery laurence fishburne  and blair underwood  br    br   a liberal though good hearted harvard law professor paul armstrong is convoked to the flordia everglades by unjustly convicted black guy bobby earl confessing that sadistic cold hearted cops vilifyied and beat him to a pulp to get the confession of a gruesome murder of an eleven year old girl  as he digs further and further into the mysterious case he realizes that bobby earl is a victim of discrimination that the black police detective lt tanny brown of the small community is corrupt and villainously mean  when the infamous psychotic serial killer blair sullivan is introduced he discovers that he knows the location of the murder weapon that butchered the little girl when armstrong finds that there are lucid coincidences of sullivan  s road trip through the small town and the letter he personally wrote  bobby earl gets a re trial is unfettered from prison and eludes his horrific punishment  all seems swimmingly well until an unexpected phone call from serial killer sullivan comes into focus armstrong discovers a lurid double killing which happens to be sullivan  s parents whom he immensely detests sullivan divulges to armstrong the truth of joanie shriver  s heinous murder and why he was brought here it turns out that bobby earl is a psychopathic murderer and he really did rape and kill joanie shriver he just merely struck a bargain with fiendish psycho sullivan  to get loose so he could kill again for revenge upon armstrong  s beautiful wife and daughter now sullivan is executed to his death  armstrong and tough good guy brown chase the malevolent villain to the everglades in order to thwart him when they arrive armstrong learns that the psychotic sicko bobby earl plans to kill his wife

man eating alligators paul armstrong tanny brown his wife and daughter survive and live happily ever after  a good thriller that works delivers both mystery and subterfuge how reluctant blacks are hazed by racist lawmen sentenced to unfair penalties even though sometimes the wrongfully convicted innocent  friendly black man may in truth be the vicious baddie  sean connery is great as the oblivious holier than thou hero laurence fishburne is watchably amazing as the mean arrogant but good guy cop  underwood and harris are over the top and invigorating as the malevolent psychos capeshaw is okay ruby dee is great as the tenacious grandmother the rest of the cast is wonderful as well             filmfour are going to have to do a lot better than this little snot of a film if they  re going to get the right sort of reputation for themselves  br    br   this film is set in glasgow  although only a couple of secondary characters have anything approaching a scottish accent   the premise  about people who  s lives are going nowhere  who all meet up in the same cafe in the early hours of the morning as they have night jobs  could have made for a really funny  insightful  quirky  cultish film  instead we have a group of self obsessed saddos and a plot which has been so done to bits i  m suprised it hasn  t been banned  x and y are friends  x is sleeping with z  y sleeps with z as well  oh you figure it out  br    br   a total waste of time  painful dialogue   it sounded like something that a group of    year olds would have written for a gcse drama project  the female character was completely superfluous   just written in as a token female in the hope that women would be cajoled into seeing it  br    br   if you  re the sort of thicko lad who laughs at beer adverts and can usually be found wandering round in packs shouting on saturday nights in nondescript town centres then you will love this film and find it   a right laff    everyone else  run  don  t walk away from this sorry little misfit  br    br   and one question  when the group left the   boring   seaside town  saltcoats incidentally although they changed the name on the film   to go back to glasgow  why did they do it via the forton motorway services at lancaster which is in england             doctor mordrid is one of those rare films that is completely under the radar  but is totally worthwhile  it really reminds me of the old serials from the   s and   s  which is why i  d have loved to see follow up movies    but judging by the rest of full moon  s output there simply weren  t enough tits to satisfy the typical audience  unfortunately  thanks to a completely superfluous sacrifice scene there two too many for a family audience   which is unfortunate  because without em   this could have been a harry potter style magicfest that kids would have eaten up  both jeffrey combs and yvette nipar are great   i wasn  t sure if ms  nipar hadn  t wandered off an a list picture onto this film  she was very believable  no  seriously  anyway   it  s a shame they didn  t have the bucks to license dr  strange  because i think this could have been a total kiddie phenom             a truly muddled incomprehensible mess  most things in the film look more or less like       but then there are futuristic things just thrown in  like the policeman  s ray gun  and that car  the director seemed to be in love with colored lights  the only really notable performance was the girl who played valerie  but since there was no cast listing  i don  t know which actress that was  this one is worth missing  grade  f            it doesn  t happen very often  but occasionally one man can make a difference    a big difference  br    br   george crile  s      best seller  charlie wilson  s war  is a fascinating and eye opening account of the most unlikely   difference maker   imaginable  a relatively obscure congressman from the second district of texas    good time charlie   was known more for his libertine lifestyle than his libertarian legislation  likable and licentious  even for a politician   charlie wilson served his constituency well since the good folks of lufkin only really wanted two things  their guns and to be left alone  it  s easy street replete with his bevy of beltway beauties known  appropriately enough  as charlie  s angels  br    br   when asked why his entire office staff was composed of attractive  young aides his response is a classic    you can teach   em to type  but you can  t teach   em to grow tits    no argument there  br    br   but even the most rakish rapscallion has a conscience lurking somewhere underneath  and for charlie wilson the unimaginable atrocities being committed in afghanistan moved him to muster his entire political savvy toward funding the utter  humiliating defeat of the russian military and  possibly  to even help hasten the end of the cold war as a result  fat chance  huh  br    br   under the skillful direction of mike nichols and a smart  snappy screenplay by adam sorkin  charlie wilson  s war is a sparkling  sophisticated satire that chronicles the behind the  scene machinations of three colorful characters comprising   charlie  s team    br    br   the on screen   team    is composed of three marvelous actors with four     academy awards and nine     nominations between them  charlie is beautifully portrayed by tom hanks in a solid  slightly understated fashion that is among his best work in years  he  s aided  abetted and abedded by joanne herring  a wealthy houston socialite played by the still slinky julia roberts  hey  why else have the bikini scene than to let the world know this  by all accounts ms  roberts looks good and holds her own  but the screenplay never gives us even a hint why kabul and country is so important to her character  maybe the two afghan hounds usually by her side know    but we as an audience never do  as for the third member of the   team    philip seymour hoffman steals every scene he appears in as gust aurakotos  a smart  street  wise  i e  non ivy league graduate  cia malcontent who knows the score    both in the agency  s boardroom and in wilson  s bedroom  br    br   for the mujahideen to succeed  the most important assistance the u s  can provide is the ability to shoot down the dreaded mi    helicopter gunships which rule the skies  this takes money  lots of money  and eventually   charlie  s team   covertly coerces those in congress to fund the effort to the tune of    billion dollars for advanced weaponry to arm the afghan rebels  this includes top of the line  state of the art anti aircraft and anti tank rockets as well as other highly sophisticated killing devices  nasty  nasty stuff  br    br   that this kind of multi billion dollar illicit activity can and does take place behind congressional doors is truly alarming  every american should see this movie or read this book because it reveals a truly frightening aspect of the business as usual political scene rarely seen outside the walls of our very own government  oh momma  i wish it weren  t so    br    br   even though the initial outcome for   team charlie   was an unqualified success  the unimaginable  unanticipated final result is that these sophisticated weapons are now used against our troops by the taliban and others  since the funding was entirely   covert    the young generation in this part of the world has no idea the fall of soviet oppression and the end to russian barbarity was the direct result of american intervention  yes  once the russkies left  so did our aid    zip for schools  zip for infrastructure  zip on maintaining meaningful relationships with the afghan people  as a result  the overall consequence is an unmitigated disaster    it  s like the forerunner to   mission accomplished    br    br   as nichol  s film so pointedly points out    the ball you  ve set in motion can keep bouncing even after you  ve lost interest in it    mike krzyzewski knows this  eva longoria parker knows this  little lateesha in lafayette knows this  but the typical american politician doesn  t  so we go from good guys to bad guys because we couldn  t let the world know we were the good guys  talk about a catch     another mike nichols film   br    br   perhaps charlie wilson said it best    we f  ked up the end game    br    br   again             i  m a big fan of surrealist art  but this film by bunuel  with some ideas from dali  left me cold  bunuel had a life long grudge against the catholic church and delighted in trying to offend catholics in fairly silly ways  this is one of the silliest  almost like what you  d expect from a smart aleck    year old in film class  the last few minutes of the movie  which have nothing to do with anything else  are a final nose thumbing at religion  br    br   if you read the   scholars   regarding this slow paced  occasionally amusing film  it  s all about how the church and society are guilty of sexual repression  if that is indeed the point  then bunuel expresses it in the most roundabout fashion possible  the central male character is a nasty brute who loves kicking dogs and knocking blind men down in the street  and who mentally turns billboard ads into strange sexual fantasies  is this behavior the church  s fault  for interrupting his lovemaking   or is he just a jerk  i vote for the latter  i think bunuel must have had a lot of personal hangups and chose the catholics as the ones to blame  br    br   there are a few moments where you might cry    aha  surrealism     a cow in a bed  a giraffe falling out a window  a poor model   a man shredding a feather pillow  a woman flushing a toilet while we watch pictures of seething lava  or a mud pit   hard to tell in b w   the rest is forgettable self indulgence  unfortunately  bunuel was still chasing the same bogey men through the rest of his career  viridiana  discreet charm      if you  re interested in seeing surrealism on the screen  check out jean cocteau  s early work             this ludicrous film offers the standard       s   hippie mentality   in a nut shell and bores us in the process  its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young  innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups  a naive young hippy played by the waif like   kay lenz   hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys  and then one day she meets the ridiculous  holden   already in old age  hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor  and she decides that she is in   love   with him  if you think that is superficial  the whole film encapsulates such scenes  she keeps saying how much she   loves   him and she only met him  it wears thin and really quick  i couldn  t help but laugh throughout the film  its obvious she  s just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place  a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex  i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit  a corny offering of music from the     s is also spread through the film  avoid this if you can  grade d             this film was pretty good  i am not too big a fan of baseball  but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love  determination  heart  etc  br    br   danny glover  joseph gordon levitt  brenda fricker  christopher lloyd  tony danza  and milton davis jr  are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport  the plot was believable  and i love the message  william dear and the guys put together a great movie  br    br   most sports films revolve around true stories or events  and they often do not work well  but this film hits a    on the perfectness scale  even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there  br    br                   for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments  in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film  the ending is superb  the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it s ending wasn t an end but a beginning of the end  a great movie and only a piece of japan s great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind           this film contain far too much meaningless violence  too much shooting and blood  the acting seems very unrealistic and is generally poor  the only reason to see this film is if you like very old cars            pathetic attempt to use science to justify new age religion philosophy  the two have nothing to do with each other and much of what is said about quantum physics in this mess is just plain wrong  br    br   examples  quantum theory supports the ideas in eastern religions that reality is an illusion  how  well  in the world of the subatomic  you can never definitely predict a particles location at a specific time  you can only give the odds of it being precisely at one spot at one time  also  the act of observation seems to affect the event  solid particles can pass through barriers  all of this  so far  is accurate  but then they assert that that means that if you believed sincerely enough that you could walk through a wall  you could indeed do it  this is complete poppycock  instead  the theory asserts that at our level  it is possible for you to walk through a wall  but it is merely by chance and has nothing to do with belief  also you  d have to keep walking into the wall for eternity to ever have even the remotest chance of passing through the wall  the odds are so astronomically against it  br    br   this is but one example of how they misrepresent the science  but much more annoying is the narrative involving an unhappy photographer  played by marlee maitlan  about halfway through the picture it becomes so confused as to be incomprehensible  something to do with negative thoughts leading to addiction and self hate  there may be some truth to that  but quantum physics has nothing to do with it  br    br   plus  string theory is the hot new thing in physics nowadays  instead of wasting your time with this dreck  i suggest you rent the elegant universe  an amazing series done for nova on pbs that gives you a history of physics from newton and gravity to ed witten and m theory in only   hour long episodes  quantum mechanics is explained there quite well if you want to know it without the fog of metaphysical appropriation             i was truly looking forward to this title  it sounded and looked fun  the idea of someone making a cheesy   s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs  but instead this title only bores  first off  there is almost no froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment  i have to sit through     minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the froggg humping a bare breasted chick  why  on top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot  i mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads  i wanted to see some hot chicks search for the creature in the swamp  i wanted to see some cuties dragged off to his lair in desperate need of rescue  creature from the black lagoon stuff   i wanted to see a few goofy action scenes of the froggg going on a killing spree  or it maybe escaping a silly trap  something exciting  geez  have fun with it  be creative  who wants to sit through endless and tiring dialog scenes in a creature flick  my advice to the filmmakers  keep going  your concepts are good  but your execution needs to be a lot more inspired  have some fun with the creature  put the humor in the action and most important   put more creature in a creature movie               one of my sisters friends lent me this game  and it is too damn hard  it carries the appearance of a kids game  but you have to learn how to do tons of intricate moves that require you to twist and turn your hands into all sorts of awkward positions  and you have to search seemingly endless levels for     notes  to improve your   score    you also have to find these impossibly hidden jigsaw puzzle pieces  that require you to do almost impossible tasks to get them  and i am only up to stage three      maybe if you have no life nad can stay home all the time you might get some enjoyment out of this  but otherwise keep away  and it is definately not recommended for kids   they will pull their hair out within the hour             chuck jones  s   rabbit seasoning    the second in the much beloved hunting trilogy  is often considered to be the best of the three  while i find it almost impossible to choose between this trio of fantastic cartoons  i would have to concede that   rabbit seasoning   is the most finely honed script  here  the emphasis is placed on language as bugs and daffy run through a series of complex dialogues in the grand tradition of abbot and costello  s   who  s on next   routine  as a long term daffy fan  i have always been delighted by the hunting trilogy because it is consistently daffy who gets all the best lines  the famous   pronoun trouble   being one of the all time classics  and does most of the work  bugs plays the role of cool manipulator while elmer  as always  is the befuddled dupe  part of what makes the hunting trilogy so much fun is that daffy and elmer pose so little threat to bugs that he is basically just kicking back and having some easy laughs  elmer falls into every trap that is laid for him but it is poor old daffy who comes off worst  being shot in the face again and again  his beak ending up in more and more ridiculous positions  it all builds to the inevitable climactic declaration   you  re despicable    as intricate an example of chuck jones  s impeccable timing as you  ll come across    rabbit seasoning   is a true classic             a lovely little b picture with all the usual joe lewis touches     people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear  also  alas  an ending that comes out of nowhere  because  apparently  the auteur has lost interest in the movie  or perhaps because as a b picture it has to fit into a slot               crossfire   is a justifiably famous      noir that  s a murder mystery with a strong message  it stars robert young  robert mitchum  robert ryan  sam levene  and gloria grahame  and is strongly directed by edward dmytryk  we witness the murder in shadow at the beginning  and for the rest of the film  young  as the detective  finlay  in charge of the case  seeks to figure out which of three soldiers is responsible for the death  and just as important  why  the victim  joseph samuels  sam levene  is someone the soldiers meet in a bar  they go up to his apartment to continue their visit  and samuels winds up dead  br    br   i don  t know about       but seeing   crossfire   today  one knows who did it and why the minute we see the suspects  i don  t suppose it was so apparent back then  as these actors were just getting started  nevertheless  the film packs a big punch with its powerful acting  good direction  violence  and unsparing anti semite language  br    br   the characterizations are vivid  including that of gloria grahame in a smallish role   she  s a woman who meets mitchell  george cooper   one of the suspect soldiers  in a bar and can provide him with an alibi  the big performance in the film belongs to robert ryan  but everyone is excellent  robert young especially is effective as a tough but intelligent police detective  mitchum is very likable as a soldier trying to help his confused friend mitchell  a lonely man unsure if he still has feelings for his wife  br    br   truly excellent  and a must see             awwww  i just love this movie to bits  me and my cousins enjoy this movie a lot and i am just such a huge fan    i hope they bring the tv series out on dvd soon  come to mention it  i have not see the tv show in a long time  such geart times  where i come from australia the chipmunk adventure is only known by people in their late teens and adult years which is kinda sad because the young kids don  t know what there missing  br    br   the songs in this film are ace the ones i love the most boys girls of rock n  roll  diamond dolls and the song that ls sure to make you want to cry my mother  br    br   this film is sure to excite both young and old get the chipmunk adventure today       out of     such an excellent movie             skippy from   family ties   plays eddie  a wussy   metal   nerd who gets picked on  when his favorite wussy   metal   singer  sammi curr  dies  he throws a hissy fit tearing down all the posters on his bedroom wall  but when he later gets an unreleased record that holds the spirit of his dead   metal   idol  he first gets sucked into ideas of revenge  but then he doesn  t want to take it as far as sammi does  which isn  t really that far as his main victims only seem to go to the hospital  this movie is utterly laughable and has about as much to do with real metal as say    rock star    ok  maybe a tad more than that piece of junk  but you get my point  and how anyone can root for a guy played by skippy from   family ties   i haven  t a clue  the cameo by gene simmons is ok  and ozzy osbourne reaches coherency  i applaud him for that  but otherwise skip this one  br    br   my grade  d  br    br   eye candy elise richards gets topless  an a topless extra at a pool party            of course i would have to give this film    out of    as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime  rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over    years living in italy  he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing  so rodolfo sonego did  if you check out his biography  you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy  alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories  my uncle visited australia and my town  in      to check out locations for   a girl in australia   and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war  you can see his humor in all his movies  i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently  great            goldeneye will always go down as one of thee most legendary games in vg history  their is no doubt about that  but this game  although quite different  could quite possibly be the modern day bond champ  of its time  br    br   this was not a bond game based on material from another medium  this was a completely new  scripted game  which even had its own theme song   wouldnt be bond without it  haha   gameplay was excellent  and if you  re a fan of the bond games or films alike  you  ll enjoy it  br    br   unlike some most games  these cast members portrayed their characters themselves  as opposed to fictional creations for the game  which gives it that more cinematic feel  with a very   bond   able storyline  you feel like you  re in the game as much as you get lost in a movie  br    br   enjoyable in all aspects  from start to finish  even after beating the game there  s still plenty more to be done  with the ranking system and unlockables to be achieved  as well as its multi player missions  this is a stand out game  despite being quite old now  in video game years  it  s still a good game that you can pick up   play whenever you feel the need to get a little more bond in your life  even now just thinking about it  i  ve got the theme song stuck in my head  such a great cast and well written storyline  br    br   the story comes to life on the screen  almost as if the actors were their in front of you  and is every bit as entertaining as the game itself  superbly done  in true bond fashion  which can only be named awesome  completely awesome  br    br   i  ve gotta go throw this game on now  if you haven  t played it yet  you  re missing out            helena bonham carter is the center of this movie  she plays her role almost immobile in a wheelchair but still brings across her traditional intensity  kenneth branagh was tolerable  the movie itself was good not exceptional  if you are a helena bonham carter fan it is worth seeing            i commented on this when it first debuted and gave it a   thumbs in the middle   review  remarking that i  d give it the benefit of the doubt beyond just the first episode  i  ve seen a total of six episodes now up to this point in june       and as a lifelong batman fanatic  i can say without hesitation  this show is utter crap  br    br   everything  s wrong with it  everything  getting past just the lousy animation and design  the stories are ridiculously convoluted and with no character development or apparent interest by the writers of this dreck to give any substance to any stories  br    br   and for god  s sake   is it just me  or is the joker in every episode   is gotham that much of a revolving door justice system  or  again  is it just a complete lack of interest in the writers to put any effort into other villains  see   no character development    above   br    br   and to make matters worse  every single joker tale is the same   part formula  br    br      joker gasses people  br    br      joker sets out to gas the whole city  br    br      batman saves the day  br    br   pfeh  br    br   there was one episode i saw that wasn  t a joker story  the title escapes me  but the villain was that nefarious cluemaster   the   think thank thunk   episode with the quiz show  that was the single worst batman story i  ve ever seen  heard or read  yes  worse than   i  ve got batman in my basement     br    br   i can  t really say what i feel this show is because it  s probably against the tos  but it starts with   b   and rhymes with   fastardization    thank goodness for the existence of the timm dini etc  era of bat entertainment  back from the fox and kids wb days  stuff that good  and i should have known this  just couldn  t possibly have lasted forever  unfortunately             just because someone is under the age of    does not mean they are stupid  if your child likes this film you  d better have him her tested  i am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad  this   film   is a showcase for digital wizardry and nothing else  the writing is horrid  i can  t remember when i  ve heard such bad dialogue  the songs are beyond wretched  the acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much  who decided to employ joey fatone  he cannot sing and he is ugly as sin  br    br   the worst thing is the obviousness of it all  it is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible  great children  s movies are wicked  smart and full of wit   films like shrek and toy story in recent years  willie wonka and the witches to mention two of the past  but in the continual dumbing down of american more are flocking to dreck like finding nemo  yes  that  s right   the recent charlie   the chocolate factory and eye crossing trash like red riding hood               hey babu riba   is a film about a young woman  mariana  nicknamed   esther   after a famous american movie star   and four young men  glenn  sacha  kicha  and pop  all perhaps       years old in      belgrade  yugoslavia  the five are committed friends and crazy about jazz  blue jeans  or anything american it seems  br    br   the very close relationship of the teenagers is poignant  and ultimately a sacrifice is willingly made to try to help one of the group who has fallen on unexpected difficulties  in the wake of changing communist politics  they go their separate ways and reunite in       the year before the film was made   br    br   i enjoyed the film with some reservations  the subtitles for one thing were difficult  especially in the beginning  there were a number of dialogues which had no subtitles at all  perhaps the conversational pace required it  but i couldn  t always both read the text and absorb the scene  which caused me to not always understand which character was involved  i watched the movie  a video from our public library  with a friend  and neither of us really understood part of the story about acquiring streptomycin for a sick relative  br    br   this yugoslavian coming of age film effectively conveyed the teenagers   sense of invulnerability  idealism  and strong and loyal bonds to each other  there is a main flashforward  and it was intriguing  keeping me guessing until the end as to who these characters were vis a vis the      cast  and what had actually happened  br    br   i would rate it   out of     and would like to see other films by the director  jovan acin                         after a snowstorm  the roads are blocked and the highway patrolman jason  adam beach  comes to the diner of his friend fritz  jurgen prochnow  and advises his clients that they will only be able to follow their trips on the next day  among the weird strangers  jason meets his former sweetheart nancy  rose mcgowan   who has just left her husband in los angeles  along the night  without any communication with his base  jason faces distressful and suspicious situations with the clients  and finds some corpses  indicating that among them there is a killer  br    br     the last stop   could be an average thriller  but the screenplay is simply awful  most of the characters are despicable persons and the motives of the surprising serial killer are never disclosed  and the viewers have no further explanation why the killer decided to kill the guests  my vote is four  br    br   title  brazil     encurralados      trapped               this movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about murphy  s law being applied to home ownership and construction  if a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional  since it was set in the   simpler   forties  we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era  grant of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by loy and douglas  their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment                   what can you say about the film white fire  amazing  fantastic  disturbing  hilarious  these words are not big enough to describe the event which is white fire  from wobbly  garbled beginning to profound end  this movie will entertain throughout  br    br   our movie begins in the woods of a country somewhere in the world  a family is hiding from unmarked soldiers in costume shop uniforms  when the father separates from the mother and their childen  you get a real sense of what kind of movie you  re about to watch  father makes sure to roll down hills in his all white outfit  and is polite as he gets people  s attention before he shoots them  but alas  dad is burned alive in what looks like a very unsupervised  unsafe stunt  meanwhile  mom and the kids are running down a beach with an armed soldier trailing about   feet behind them  he too gives a stern warning before action in the form of a bizarre   halt     and then promptly wastes the mother  this action sequence sets up the happy childhood of our heroes bo and ingred  br    br   so now we fast forward about    years     if you  re honest about the hero  s age  to beautiful turkey  where bo and ingred have settled as professional thieves  or diamond prospectors  or something  ingred works at a diamond mine where she helps herself to the goods  while bo  masterfully played by the dynamic robert ginty  drives around the desert in his denim outfits  bo and ingrid have an interesting relationship  they don  t seem to have any friends other than each other  and they spend all of their time together  that coupled with the fact that bo has expressed his desire to sleep with his sister as evidenced in lines such as   you know its a shame you  re my sister   he says to her while she  s stark naked  make for a very dynamic duo  bo is then crushed when ingrid is killed  as he wanders the beaches of turkey with his ceremonial pink grief scarf  a renewal of hope occurs when bo finds a girl who looks like ingrid  and gives her plastic surgery to make her look exactly like ingrid  this opens the door for bo to have sex with his sister without it being technically wrong  bo is a real fan of ethical grey areas  and he is overjoyed with his new love  br    br   so anyway  there  s a lot of fun action scenes  ridiculous violence  great acting  impossible to follow plot lines  fred   the hammer   williamson  for some reason   and a big chunk of dirty ice which is supposed to be a giant diamond  which later explodes   all of these things are great  but the bo and ingrid relationship is what makes this movie special    really special  so i heartily encourage everyone to behold the majesty that is white fire  you may be glad you did  or not             i am so disappointed  this movie left me feeling jipped out of my time and mental energy  here was the quintessential woody allen film all over again  the neurotic upper class manhattanites debating whether or not they will cheat on their spouses  woody  i  ve seen these characters already  i  ve seen the storyline from you ten times already  where did your creativity go    you need to open your eyes and look around you  the world has changed dramatically since annie hall   and you need to change along with it  br    br   there are far more interesting and funny scenarios to which you can apply your brand of angst and neuroticism   why not try them out instead of rehashing the same old slop over and over and over again  br    br   when i hear that woody allen has a new project coming out  it does nothing for me   because now i  ve come to expect his old standby  the couple who are growing tired of each other and end up cheating  depressing and same old  same old  br    br   if woody wants to win his fans back  then he has to understand that our sense of humor and intelligence has to be stimulated   not insulted             this movie is all ultra lightweight fluff  predictable from beginning to end  as a don knotts vehicle    the incredible mr  limpet   was much better  with knott  s character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant  his performance there was toned down  with none of his trademark goggle eyed stare  although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish  knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile  much as bob denver did  neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles  assuming they were simply typecast  it was probably because of the slouch  the wild stare and the high pitched voice  john ritter  whom knotts worked with in   three  s company    was able to transcend his genre  branching out successfully into dramatic roles like   the dreamer of oz    but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in   pleasantville    even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here  uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in   airplane    and   police squad    br    br   there  s also no way the then    year old knotts could pass for a    year old  as his character insisted he was  it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at    playing the college age forrest gump  br    br   the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget  very much looking like a hastily filmed tv episode  it  s especially evident in the   exterior   scenes of the   town   where roy goes after he  s fired  it  s unlikely even a pre schooler would be fooled by the mayberry like soundstage artificiality  br    br   even viewing this strictly as a children  s movie  it  s very disappointing  it  s not because it lacks action or special effects  although it does  the pace is much too slow  the situations repetitive  how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus  a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap  with breakneck gags  otherwise you risk boring them  and any adults in the theater as well   movies  even kid  s movies  have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades  even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written  disney  s   the love bug    for instance  at least had some interesting race action             if you are interested in learning more about this sort of thing happening in modern civilization  there is an excellent book called   outlaw seas   or   the outlaw sea    and it describes  in story after story  how these things do happen  the lawlessness of the high seas is a reality for a number of reasons  one  many of the world  s freighters are of questionable registry  nationality  and it  s difficult to impossible to enforce international laws when the ships owners don  t have an office in a real country  two  many ship lines employ crews from dirt poor third world countries  the crews are often  like illegal immigrant workers  threatened and bullied into complying with questionable or illegal practices  three  there is often a language barrier  not only between the officers and the crew  but also between the crew members themselves  the crew are rewarded for their compliance and their silence  four  once committing an illegal act  the ships are able to hide in plain sight with little more than a fresh coat of paint  anyway  it  s fascinating reading  br    br   horrifying story  excellent movie  does anyone else notice how hbo seems to make the best and most important movies  hollywood has trouble releasing enough oscar worthy movies in any given year  so that several of the top   contenders usually come from britain  jerry bruckheimer   the end of quality cinema  br    br   i loved the thoroughly evil performance by sean pertwee  i also  as usual  loved omar epps             gamers  dr is not a fancy made movie  it  s more like amateur video  horrible magic effect  really fake fireball  terribly made dungeon  castle  village       sword  axe  shield  robe  plate      okok    everything  you will need about    minutes to adjust your expecting on visual  then you will get     minutes of fun  br    br   i  m from hongkong and it  s really hard to find rpers  none of my friends play rpg and i always fancy to be one of the character in the world of d d  watching gamers  dr just show me what would it be like to be a gamer  you see rule books  dices  game set  etc etc etc  you hear terms like   fighter      wizard      hit point      level      character      flaming hand      chaotic evil    br    br   what rpg fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to  not bonded by software rpg  gamers  dr provide the same element  you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead  the movie goes both gamers  s real life as well as in the d d world  you will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action  which make you feel you really participle in the game  br    br   i don  t want to spoil anything  but in short  gamers  dr is a must watch movie for rpg lovers  for people never play rpg game  i  m sure you still get many fun from it             in all honesty  i haven  t seen this film for many years  but the few times i have tend to make parts of it stick in my memory  as anyone who has seen it will understand  i first saw it as a child at a ymca halloween party in the early sixties  and it scared the hell out of us kids  in a fun way  i remember feeling genuine anxiety about the unknown thing lurking in the maze  i can  t risk giving away the ending  except to say that it was surprising  to say the least  i remember vaguely the entire audience of young boys letting out a big scared holler  followed by laughter when the terrible secret was revealed  the ending has been seen by most viewers as one of the greatest unintentionally funny climaxes to a movie in film history  and yet oddly moving  in a way  you have to see it for yourself  which is not easy these days  i don  t know if it  s available on home video or not  but it would still make a great halloween feature for both kids and adults             this is the only thing i will be able to look back on from the year      and say now that rocked  it rocked hard  and yet it also rocked tasty  mr meatloaf added a nice little touch to this dish of a film before the opening credits even rolled  now that tells you something  this filmed rocked even before it started  now i don  t want to give to much away or be a   spoiler   but this movie rocked  if you have heard the new album and thought to yourself   this seems a bit substandard tenacious material it is like i a merely playing badminton with satan  what gives    then this movie will elevate your appreciation for the music and you will marvel at this steamy satanic masterpiece  for those who would want it better do not know what they want because better would no longer be the d  this movie is the d period  so venture if you dare to the local viewing theater if you to want to have your socks rocked             you  d think you  re in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel      miles or so from france to saudi arabia  going through most of europe   italy  bulgaria  croatia  slovenia  turkey  before arriving in the middle east  but this is not a tour  and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights  br    br   reda  s father is in his twilight years  and wishes to do the haj  however  since walking and taking the mule is out of the question  he chooses to travel to mecca by car  he can  t drive  and therefore enlists the help of reda  to his son  s protest  to get him there in their broken down vehicle  br    br   but reda doesn  t see the point of having him go along  when his dad could opt for the plane  he resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn  t understand  and hence  we set off in this arduous journey with father and son  being not the best of pals  br    br   the beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair  the challenges they face  the weird people they meet  having to duke it out in varied weather conditions  and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car  we see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other  the father trying to impose on his son  and the son trying to assert himself as an adult  but circumstances we see  reveal that reda is quite a fish out of water  through the many encounters  they actually team up quite well despite their differences  br    br   it  s perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with hari raya haji  and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their haj  the final scene in mecca is truly a sight to behold  and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating  the sights of europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon  so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination  br    br   it certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are  don  t miss this  and yes  book early   i was pleasantly surprised that this evening  s session was still a full house             i watched this movie based on the good reviews here  and i won  t make that mistake again  br    br   the first couple minutes shows that a group of people have been brought together by some tragedy  but you don  t see what it is  flashback    hours and we get to see the boring lives of each of these people  which in the end are totally meaningless to what is about to happen  when the ending is finally reveled  you realize that you just wasted an hour of your life waiting for a big payoff that doesn  t happen and means nothing to what you have been watching  the only connection these people have is that they have all had a   bad day    but even that continuity gets lost in the boredom  br    br   if this was supposed to be a   crash   clone  it  s a complete failure             a great bugs bunny cartoon from the earlier years has bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store  after he  s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he  ll be transferring soon  bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy   and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals  animals like say  a certain rabbit  this causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer  i found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early       s  it still remains as funny nearly     years later  this animated short can be seen on disc   of the looney tunes golden collection volume    br    br   my grade  a             i firmly believe that the best oscar ceremony in recent years was in      for two reasons   br    br       host steve martin was at his most wittiest     i saw the teamsters help michael moore into the trunk of his limo    and    i  ll better not mention the gay mafia in case i wake up with a poodle  s head in my bed     br    br       surprise winners  no one had adrien brody down for best actor   genuine applause   or roman polanski for best director   genuine jeers and boos   but they won  br    br   last year  s award ceremony wasn  t too bad but there was little in the way of surprises and i was happy to see return of the king sweep the awards even if it wasn  t the best in the trilogy   fellowship was much better  but what let the bbc coverage down was jonathan ross getting a few of his sycophantic mates round and pretending they were hilarious when they were anything but   so when i heard sky were doing the coverage for british tv i was expecting barry norman and mark kermode to be doing the links   but instead we ended up with jamie theakston and sharon osbourne   oh gawd if british tv are desperate for film critics   obviously they are   i  m sure both bob the moo and theo robertson will happily fly over to la to give their honest opinions on the winners and losers  br    br   chris rock wasn  t too bad   but he  s no steve martin while the location seemed to resemble a sports hall with seats put in   not much of a glitzy arena in my opinion   the main problem i had with the ceremony was the format with the    minor    oscars handed out to the winners who were sitting in their seats   there  s no such thing as a    minor    oscar and just because the award is for best animated short or best costume design they  re as well deserved as best picture or best director   all the winners should be allowed to march up to the podium   what a bunch of arrogant snobs the academy are becoming and i quite agree with the comments that this format is disgraceful and if it wasn  t for the surprises this could possibly have been the worst ceremony in history   as for the awards themselves  br    br   best supporting actress   cate blanchett   no great surprise for a competitive category  br    br   best supporting actor   morgan freeman   no real complaints since freeman is one of america  s greatest living character actors  br    br   best actor   jamie foxx   most predictable award of the night   yawn  br    br   best actress   hilary swank   major surprise since everyone thought annette benning was going to win simply down to academy politics but swank did deserve it and gave the best speech of the night  br    br   best director   clint eastwood   major surprise since everyone thought scorsese was going to get the award simply because he  d never won one   actually i  m glad about this because if he didn  t deserve it for taxi driver   raging bull or goodfellas he didn  t deserve it for the aviator  br    br   best film   million dollar baby   again another major surprise since everyone thought the academy would split the awards for best director and best picture while i thought the hollywood friendly plot of the aviator would have made it a dead cert for best picture while mdb  s controversial subject matter would have turned a lot of voters off  br    br   what these awards perhaps illustrate is that this year the voters have decided to ignore oscar politics and genuinely give out awards to people who deserve it something they haven  t done in the past   i mean a beautiful mind beating the fellowship of the ring for gawd  s sake   and long may the academy vote with their heads instead of their hearts            while in a plane  flicking through the large choice of movies  i came across live  almost accidentally  oh boy  what a choice  br    br   i remembered vaguely seeing the trailer over a year ago and completely forgot about it expecting no more than another cheesy nonsense movie about a stupid reality show  now i can easily say this has been a hell of a ride  i don  t remember last time i have been so excited  terrified  not sure if it was the high altitude playing with my senses  but the suspense grow gradually through the movie until reaching a climax where you can  t turn away from the screen  literally sitting on the edge of your seat and biting the remaining nails you  ve got  br    br   you will first go through a personal moral assessment of where you stand about the righteousness of the show  you will drift from thinking   how come the human being can be so vicious   to   why not after all    ask yourself would you do it  then learn about the contestants  their motives and start guessing  you will then watch contestant pulling the trigger one by one and get excited even though you know the first candidate is safe  br    br   good acting  good directing  with a movie experience that reminds you those old movies where you knew what would happen in the next scene but still were craving for more  br    br    spoilers  couple of things i would have changed  br    br     the casting of the contestants  i have really been moved by the farmer and we should have had a bit more like him  the idea of a rich writer who wants to be famous is a bit stupid  it felt like you didn  t care about some of the contestants  although this might have been done on purpose  i think the audience should have been able to associate with the majority of the contestants    game rules  a big glitch   br    br   what happens if the  th contestants doesn  t die when he pulls the trigger  do you seriously think the last standing guy will pull the trigger and execute himself    they should have given a chance to all contestants to live  ie  if  th is a blank too  then no one dies  br    br   interestingly i haven  t been bothered too much by this bad points cause i really had a good time  just wish i had some popcorn with me             ah  another movie with motorcycles  hell  s angels posse and steve a lame o as the not so cool car driver  this movie does not rely on story but lots of drinking  pot smoking  and lots of moronic acts  steve  s rendition of a dying cat during his   i love what i know   serenade had me vomiting for hours  bike chick linda  rrrr  makes out with everyone  fats did the best acting since he just grunts and makes sounds  i also dare you to try to make out what banjo is saying    you messin   wit private stock    this is scriptwriting folks  br    br   i liked the ending  what better place to have the climax than a lighthouse  you have to see this to detest it  br    br   die jeter  die               a rating of       does not begin to express how dull  depressing and relentlessly bad this movie is             i feel dumber after watching the first    min luckily i walked out and saved the rest of my brain  people should watch better films and take notes on why they are rated highly not because of the budget of the film or the special effects  just simply good acting and getting simple things right and most importantly  not being lame    but i guess this was produced for those sheeple without taste and not a clue of what is     a good movie    don  t be scared of rating films low save your under appreciated high scores for     once in a life time movies      keep in mind that many use imdb for trusted reviews and opinions don  t spoil the broth by sugarcoating turds peace   love            the most self indulgent movie i have every had the misfortune to br    br   rent  unwatchable  much of the movie is obviously improvised  br    br   and not well  it looks like toback took the first take of br    br   everything  the movie gets good for a couple of minutes when br    br   robert downey jr  shows up  then goes to hell again real br    br   quickly             this has got to be the worst movie i haver ever seen nielson in  this movie just does not have what he needs to be funny  i think the reasons that the naked gun and the like movies is that they did not require nielson to be funny  he just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual  but when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny  he isn  t  the movie had only one good part  and this may be considered a spoiler by some  and that the beginning credits were animated  if the whole movie had been animated  it might have been good  i had no intention of seeing this movie when i saw the ads for it  and the only reason i did see it was because the tickets were given to me by someone who won them in a radio contest  this is the first and probably only movie i have ever walked out on  on a scale of      i give this movie a score of                  i like ghost stories  good ghost stories of bumps in the night  voices that cannot be explained  now i  ve see many of them  as special efx have a ever more grip on todays films  some times to find a real gem   you gotta turn the clock back to the time when the writers and directors really had to use their heads to create really good ghost stories  now this one  very rare   pilot episode for the tv series ghost story called    the new house    was one of the most scariest films i ever saw  it was on once in         i was only     but nothing since then even compared to it  with all the remake going on in hollywood  some one should do this one    as is    with no more special efx than the original  this episode was down right creepy as hell  i  m lucky to find it finally on dvd today and very rare and hard to find  the only other   ghost stories to even come close was the original    the haunting    and george c  scott in    the changling      wish someone would do more ghost stories like these             okay  i  ve watched this movie twice now  i have researched it heavily on the net  i have asked several people on there opinions  i have even gone to the length of reading the original sheridan lafanu classic   carmilla    a book that this movie is supposed to be based on  i feel that the best way to review this movie is to describe a game to play whilst watching it  as the plot of the movie doesn  t seem to make any sense at all  here is the plot of the book  br    br   laura lives in a castle in syberia with her father  mr de lafontaine  they carry on with their lives blissfully and peacefully  one day they get a letter from the   general   a man who has made it his mission in life to avenge his daughters death  he makes claims of supernatural powers being at work  and explains that he will visit them soon  meanwhile  a chance encounter with a strange woman results in the lafontaines looking after her daughter  carmilla  for several months  soon laura starts to be overwhelmed by strange dreams  and begins to come down with a strange illness  who is this mysterious carmilla  and just what has she to do with laura  s condition  and the general  br    br   i have invented this game and would like as many people as possible to play it  and let me know what their results are  i even have a catchy name  and would have a jingle too  but i can  t be bothered with that  it  s called the   this movie doesn  t make any sense   game  br    br   all you have to do is  whilst watching the movie  try to come up with a complete plot that explains what is happening  i mean complete  all questions answered  everything makes sense  absolutely complete  br    br   it will have to answer such questions as      br    br     why can vampires walk around in day light  br    br     why are they all lesbians  br    br     why is a girl called bob  and why does she shoot herself  br    br     when is the movie a dream and when is it real  br    br     why does killing zombies appear to be an accepted part of life that doesn  t make anyone bat an eyelid  br    br     why does travis fontaine spot and run down a zombie without slowing down whilst driving his car  yet when faced with a woman with an obvious hostage in the back of her car  accept the excuse that she is a zombie too  br    br     and why does he then let a girl  which he later openly reveals that he knows is the head vampire  drive with him in his car  br    br     and then let her drive off  alone with his daughter in a stolen car  br    br   what the hell is the asylum scene all about  br    br     what the hell is the green goo all about  br    br     why does the head vampire suddenly start dressing like a nurse  br    br     why are there never any vampires fighting zombies  br    br     what is the significance of the necklace  what is it made of  why does it kill vampires  and how does jenna know that  br    br   in fact sod it  it  s just as much fun trying to come up with as many questions about this movie too  br    br   i have my plot  and i have to admit it is not quite there  but it is a pretty good effort  br    br   in conclusion br    br     vampires vs zombies   has no moment in it where there are actually vampires fighting zombies  everyone in the movie seems to know exactly what is going on  yet they seem very reluctant to let the audience in on this  and somehow it is based on a classic   th century horror novel  how  why  what the hell is going on             this would  ve been a  great  silent film  the acting really is good  at least in a look ma  i  m doing really big acting  sort of way  br    br   everything is huge  every line is profound  every scene is shattered by human tragedy  br    br   mostly  i felt like gagging  yet  like any train wreck  i couldn  t tear my eyes away  this dialogue might  ve worked on the stage  although i doubt it  on the screen  it was cluttered  haphazard  hackneyed and pretty much every other stereotypical negative adjective you can come up with to describe a really bad dramatic work  br    br   if you enjoy your melodrama in huge  heaping doses  you  might  enjoy the movie  be prepared to wait  however  for all that melodrama  this thing sure plods along at its own pace  br    br   this script must  ve sounded a lot different when the actors involved were reading it to themselves  it simply doesn  t work once they get around to delivering it in front of the camera  br    br   imdb does us a great disservice  at times  when it uses its goofy computer controlled   weighted score    curse of the starving class deserves less than a    br    br   character driven fiction is great  but when you develop your characters by simply pushing them through hoops with no plausible explanation for their maturation or evolution  it isn  t character development  your characters must have a motivation  being drunk for a while and waking up in a field is  not  character development  that  s a plot contrivance  br    br   stay away from this movie  or at the very least  watch it muted  perhaps you  ll get some amusement from all the arm waving the characters do  br    br   oh  and word to the wise    to prove that this is truly an artsy film  you see james woods in all his dangly male   look at me  i  m the figurative and literal representation of the naked vulnerability of  man   glory  br    br   don  t say you weren  t warned             this movie starts with the main character lying in a coma in a hospital ward  attended by two orderlies  the unconscious main character is heard in a voice over  saying that the orderlies are gay  the orderlies kiss  i watched this in a dvd version and i have the suspicion that this is supposed to be funny    it said   comedy   on the dvd case  after all and it goes on like that  had i seen this in a movie theater i probably would have heard part of the audience roar with laughter  because it is so funny    and because they are supposed to sit in a comedy  while it is fascinating to think about what it is funny and what isn  t  this movie unfortunately only delivers arguments about what isn  t  br    br   brilliant brains can make anything funny  people like ernst lubitsch  billy wilder or mel brooks have proved that fact  but you have to know the   mechanics    i suppose  director and co scriptwriter dani levy does not bother about those mechanics  he thinks that certain things simply are funny  the fact that two orderlies are gay and kiss over a man in a coma  for example  do not get me wrong  some people can make that funny  dani levy can  t  not for me  anyway  br    br   the main problem i have with this movie is that i can  t see a reason behind the way the main characters behave  i could not understand why the two brothers  one an orthodox jew from west germany one a third class carbon copy of fast eddie felson from former east germany so strongly disliked each other  they are both rather bland characters  their children are boring apart from the fact that they are sexually attracted to each other  well  one is a lesbian now but raises the daughter she has with her cousin   but even these incestuous relationships    if anything they are embarrassing   just come through as an excuse because the scriptwriters could not come up with anything better  br    br   the acting is not bad  udo semel i actually came to like quite a lot although he reminded me more of ex chancellor helmut kohl  a lighter version  than of a venerable orthodox jew  the direction in itself is not really bad either  but maybe levy should stick to directing movies  leaving the scriptwriting to someone else  now i heard he did a comedy about hitler  oi  vai             this story about three women is a very sensitive study about  muri  l  charlotte van den eynde  the youngest  laura  els dottermans  who is about    and martha  frieda pittors  the oldest who is the mother of muri  l  they live together in the same building  they have different expectations of life  the vital laura wants a child  muri  l comes from a village and wants to change her life in brussels  martha dreams about her youth when she was a young girl  in fact nothing happens in this movie so you wait for something   for instances an accident   which could dramatize this story  as times goes on  you discover that the director doroth  e van den berghe only wants to develop a psychological portrait of the three women and nothing more  this movie is disappointing because you expect the women to learn from their experiences which is not the case  so one is left with a feeling of emptiness             first and foremost  i loved the novel by ray bradbury  it  s the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later  it was one of his best books  with  you know  fahrenheit     and dandelion wine  i as just hoping that this movie would be all right  it had lots of chances  with a great cast  like jason robards and jonathn pryce  and bradbury even wrote the script himself  and on top of all that  it has pam grier  br    br   how could it fail  br    br   there may be spoilers within  br    br   first of all  it was dumbed down  much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum  all the visuals from the book   gone  everything that made you squirm   gone  br    br   and then there  s the acting  like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the   s  the kids in this movie cannot act  and  this bugged me a lot  neither of them looked    but   or     their strong friendship wasn  t addressed  it was more like they were acquaintaces   br    br   you  d think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr  halloway and mr  dark  but here it  s like they just don  t care  all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something  this is far from being some of their best performances   br    br   pam grier was fine as the witch  but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn  t well pulled off  she  s a lot less evil and doesn  t have the presence as she did in the book   br    br   and everything that was left out of the book  the ballon night chase  the marking of jim  s house  the real death of mr  dark  what happened to mr  coogan on the merry go round  the fate of the lightening rod salesman  the real death of the witch  and oh so much more   br    br   and the special effects were bad  even for the   s  the merry go round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn  t really creepy  and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything   br    br   i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel  but it makes blood boil  don  t see this movie but read the book  it  s a classic of bradbury             this film is so old i never realized how young looking ray milland looked in       i remember him playing in a great film    lost weekend    ray plays the role of michael stuart  who is a very rich banker  there are three girls in this picture who are not very happy about their father and mother separating and they find out their father is going to get married to a young blonde who is a gold digger only looking for a rich sugar daddy  they hire a man to pose as a very rich count  his name is count ariszted   misha auer  who is drunk all the time and is penniless and gives plenty of comic laughs throughout the picture  deanna durbin   penny craig  surprised everyone when she was booked in a police station and told the chief of police that she was an opera star and then penny starts singing with the most fantastic soprano voice i have every heard  the entire police department and convicts started applauding  which was a very entertaining and enjoyable scene from this film  this is deanna durbin  s first film debut and she became an instant success over night and went on to become a great movie star with universal studios after leaving mgm             i had eagerly awaited the first screening of this film ever since it was given to me on dvd at christmas  having reserved a special slot for it last night  i sat down to watch it with my daughter  aged    and a film studies student   with chocolates of course  in eager anticipation  we love jane austin  br    br   after just the first two minutes we knew we were sunk  the shaky camera shots and angles  general poor cinematography  direction and wooden performances had already left us feeling flat and dissatisfied  despondent  we viewed on  br    br   anne  played by sally hawkins  looked oddly and with no particular purpose  directly at the camera on several occasions  breaking our hard won   fantasy of the moment   and engaging us directly in an almost   i  ll find you   stalking fashion  br    br   poor rupert penry jones  who played captain wentworth  did his best with the script and direction  bless him  i hope they paid him well  however  as he was practically drowned on one occasion by a huge wave which predictably breached the seawall  drenching him and his co actor  they were nearly swept out to sea  health and safety would have had a field day  poor rupert was left spitting out sea water in order to deliver his line  presumably there was not enough money left in the kitty for a re shoot of this scene  anyone with any sense would have not attempted it on such a day in the first place  br    br   other than mr  penry jones  alice krige gave the only convincing performance as lady russell but her efforts were soon counterbalanced by those of anthony head  s unconvincing portrayal of annoying sir walter elliott  br    br   towards the long awaited end of the film  captain wentworth appeared to oddly grace anne with a visit every two seconds having taken great pains to avoid her for the majority of the movie  it was as if he had developed a memory impediment which caused him to forget his very reason for being  in contrast  anne ran  hyper ventilating  from pillar to post in search of the good captain who  in the meantime  had managed to call upon almost the entirety of bath we are told  in the course of only three or four minutes  without even having worked up a sweat  br    br   we experienced none of anne  s charms crossing the screen  indeed  we were left wondering what charismatic captain wentworth had ever seen in plain  spineless  opinion less anne and why someone  anyone  did not tell mean  winging sir walter to just shut the heck up  br    br   the crucial kiss  normally our favourite girlie moment  was painfully drawn out  as they moved in closer  anne kept opening and closing her mouth which had the effect on screen of making her look as if she were chewing gum before lips finally met  eww   br    br   the most enjoyable thing about last night was the chocolates and the half hour exchange of views between mother and daughter on just how bad the film had been  br    br   what a pity to ruin such an enchanting and engaging story  filmed in some of england  s finest scenery  br    br   sorry jane             if you like sci fi  monsters  and ancient legends  then you will love this movie    br    br   the special effects are by far the best i have seen since juarassic park hit the big screen years ago  while the acting may have been a little less than desirable  the story line and effects adequately compensated for it  br    br   i wish now i had seen this at the movies on a theater screen instead of our    inch big screen tv  br    br   if you like non stop action  awesome visuals  and taste for myth and lore    you have to see this movie              a rather silly little film you just may love  br    br   although rather corny and clich   at times  it nonetheless works and makes for good clean fun  five teams are engaged on a scavenger hunt and battle each other and their wits to win the all night contest   just for the sheer joy   knowing yours is the best team    br    br   notable for several screen debuts including david naughton  s first film role after his dr  pepper   be a pepper   commercials and before his major      hit   american werewolf in london    also features paul ruebens in what i believe is his first pee wee herman esquire roll a year before he became known for it  and last but not least  mr  spin city and alex keaton himself  michael j  fox gets his first film role here  fans will remember stephen furst as flounder in animal house  outside of that  no names  but all funny characters  br    br   doubt it has ever made it to dvd  but there are still probably some vhs copies floating around and you might even catch on a late  late show sometime  if you do  is worth your watch  you may hate it  but it may also become a quirky little movie you come to love             this is an ok adaptation of the breath taking book of dan brown  i can  t say it is novel or very good but they made a movie that you can enjoy  given the excellent story  the result could have been better though  the movie is pretty long but at the end i was feeling like some things were missing  sound effects and sound tracks were very good  acting was well done but the character development phase was very weak  for people who didn  t read the book  things may look happening too quickly  from my point of view  instead of trying to put as much as stuff from the book  they could have tried to do the important scenes more proper  what makes the book very good was all the puzzle like story combined with the excellent portrait of vatican  you see neither of it in the movie  too much rush and using the time not in a good way  these are main problems of the movie  so  it is worth watching but could have been done better             i never fell asleep during a movie  never  this movie did the impossible  br    br   while many people claim the superiority of japanese horror films over their american counterparts  this movie was a lesson in over abundance  as in  the movie was    minutes too long  it would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work  but instead  all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement  the acting was absolutely terrible  bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to ad lib something called a script  did these people even get any direction  were they coaxed to be boring and dull  either therory wouldn  t surprise me  br    br   what was even worse was the rather unscary make up involved with the creatures from the other side  either way  they all stunk  don  t watch this film  that  s all i can say  unless you  re an insomniac              what can i say  not as bad as many here have made it out to be  the only reason i even watched this film that i had previously never heard of before  was strictly for ian mcshane  br    br   i was not disappointed in the least  ian mcshane was absolutely brilliant and brings an amazing subtlety to his role  he  s always great to watch and for my money    an extremely underused actor  br    br   as for the rest of the film     every other actor in the movie delivered strong  solid performances  these people certainly weren  t being paid huge amounts of cash for their participation  as this was a fairly low budget film  but this did not mean that any of them   mailed   their appearances in  everyone was convincing and compelling with the parts given to them  br    br   i was even pleasantly surprised at adrian paul  s performance though i must admit i have only ever seen him in the highlander television series before this movie  br    br   the plot was well paced and the storyline intriguing and much like real life  not everything ends up tied in a nice neat little package for you at the end of the film  anybody who expected a clear cut  by the numbers  connect the dots   conclusion   or   answer   at the end of the movie    clearly wasn  t watching the film closely enough  this film is not going to tell you what the   meaning of life   is  the idea is that after seeing the film  you might go and discuss the unanswered questions with your friends over a coffee  i certainly did  br    br   no car chases    no explosions    no bar room brawls      sounds pretty dull  huh   but the reality is that i was completely absorbed by the film and it  s just a well written little piece with an interesting hook and solid character performances by all parties involved  br    br          warning          if you  re the kind of person who dislikes movies that dangle an enormous   question   as the central engine of the story and then end the movie without answering that particular question directly    br    br   you might not enjoy this film             originally harped as a sequel to   the slumber party massacre   series  this film falls flat on it  s face with a new title  first off  if you are going to include the word   massacre   in your film  s title  you better deliver  this one certainly does not  there is no gore  no on screen murders and no chainsaw  as the box art would lead you to believe  instead  we get a paper thin  overdone plot about a group of cheerleaders who get stranded in an abandoned cabin on the way to a football game  only to be offed one by one  again  this film could have been ok if the gore quotient was upped a bit  why directors  especially those doing direct to video flicks  are afraid to show any gore is beyond me  now  i am not a huge fan of excessive gore  but come on   why else would anyone rent a movie called   cheerleader massacre     besides that problem  the film suffers from a shot on a home video camera cheapness  it looks cheap  sounds cheap  and the actors aren  t all that good  it tries to throw us off track to who the killer may be  but even that fails  the ending ends up being a ridiculous mess  folks  if you run across this film  walk away and go find the original   slumber party massacre      out of                a killer  cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder  at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave  this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look  the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem  are back on the case  two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing  thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection  sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish  br    br   the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film  the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out  now i  m all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible  if it wasn  t for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep  there is a bit of gore but it  s never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims  the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times  there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll  the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film  it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line  br    br   the ending is extremely bad  you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does  god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel   br    br                   days of heaven is one of the most painfully boring and pointless films i have ever seen  in no way  shape  or form would i recommend it to anyone   unless you  re trying to put your kids to sleep or  god forbid  give someone an aneurysm  if i could go back in time and do one thing  i would set fire to the reels before they were sent to theaters  why  days of heaven  s plot is simple  but extremely vague  long sequences devoid of dialogue compose much of the film  the characters are too shallow and ridiculously stupid to relate with  the climax of the story does not touch you  by this time your brain has worked so hard to figure out the plot and the array of hidden metaphors that your ability to think is gone  the only things working are your eyes  and unfortunately  your ears  who must listen to the sound of linda  the little girl in the story  who talks like a man  i am now dumber for seeing this movie  don  t let it happen to you             in       director walt disney and animator ub iwerks changed the face of animation with the release of the very first installment of their   silly symphonies   series    the skeleton dance    iwerks and disney had been collaborating together since the early   s  in disney  s   laugh o gram   cartoon series  however  their friendship suffered a tremendous blow when iwerks accepted an offer by a competitor to leave disney and start his own animation studio  that was the birth of celebrity productions  where iwerks continued developing his style and technique  and where he created the character of flip the frog   while his work kept the same high quality  it wasn  t really popular and by      the studio was closed  later that year  iwerks was hired by columbia pictures  and iwerks decided to return to his old skeletons for another dance  this time in color  br    br         s   skeleton frolics   is essentially  a remake of the      classic   the skeleton dance    the movie that borough him fame and fortune  like that short film  it is set on an abandoned graveyard  where at midnight the creatures of the night come alive and begin to play  the dead rise from their coffins  ready for the show that  s about to begin  as a group of skeletons has formed an orchestra  and begin to play a happy tune  now  it  s not easy to be a musician made of just bones  as some of the orchestra members have problems with their body parts  however  the band manages to put a good show and another group of skeletons begin to dance  a lovely couple of them faces the same problems that troubled the orchestra  it  s hard to dance with loose body parts  everything ends at dawn  and just when the sun is about to rise again  the skeletons run towards their graves  br    br   directed and animated by ub iwerks himself    skeleton frolics   follows faithfully the pattern set by   the skeleton dance   years before  although with a crucial difference  iwerks did the whole film in technicolor  the bright tonalities allowed iwerks to create a more visually appealing film  and also to use the many new techniques he had been practicing since leaving disney  creating even better effects of depth and dynamism than those he conceived before  it is certainly a more experimental film than   the skeleton dance    although sadly  this doesn  t mean it  s necessarily a better film  for starters  the film is practically identical to the one he did with disney  with the only differences being the music  more on that later  and the color effects  it looks beautiful  no doubt about it  but it definitely feels kind of unoriginal after all  br    br   however  it is not the unoriginality of the concept what truly hurts the film  after all  iwerks executes it in a wonderful way   but the fact that the musical melody created by joe denat for the film is pretty uninteresting and lacks the charming elegance and whimsical fun of the one done by carl w  stalling for   the skeleton dance    in other words  while denat  s tune is effective and appropriate for the theme  it  s easy to forget about it rapidly while stalling  s song has a unique personality that makes it unforgettable  being a musical film  this is of high importance  and so the mediocrity of the music brings down iwerk  s flawless work of animation  personally  i think that with a better musical accompaniment    skeleton frolics   would be remembered as fondly as   the skeleton dance despite not being as groundbreaking  as it  s still a fun film to watch  br    br   it  s kind of sad that most of the work iwerks did after leaving disney is now forgotten due to his poor success  however  it must be said that if iwerks lacked the popularity of disney or fleischer  disney  s main rival   he did not lack the quality of those companies   films  it was probably just a case of bad luck what made the man who gave life to disney  s mouse for the first time to face failure out of disney  despite its shortcomings    skeleton frolics   is a very funny and visually breathtaking film  that while not exactly the most original and fresh film  one just can  t help but thinking of   the skeleton dance   while watching it   it definitely reminds us that iwerk  s skeletons are still here to haunt us  and inspire us  br    br                   yes  indeed  it could have been a good movie  a love biangle   sorry for the poetical license  but is not a triangle   an interesting story  unfortunately badly told  the image is sometimes weird  sometimes ok  the picture looks crowded and narrow sighted  the sound needs more attention  it usually does in romanian movies   the light and color filters are sometimes badly chosen  the soundtrack is short and is not helping the action  about the acting    sorry but the best actress is the landlady  the others are acting immaturely and cannot convince the viewer  the acting is poetical when it should be realistic  and realistic when it should be poetical  it  s a picture for adults  told by the children  bother

two of the most beautiful women in the world  your pocket watch doubles as a nuclear explosive  while your trusty pen can also be used as a semi automatic     caliber gun  you snow ski in the alps  go

queen  bad boy of the british ss  and perhaps the most desired man in the world  the character of james bond was created by ian fleming  and is the movie industry  s longest lasting icon  being the subject of over fifteen films spanning over four decades  the latest man to play the role is pierce brosnan  who took over the role of james bond from timothy dalton in       and made his     debut in goldeneye  br    br   this is the setting for the first major title developed by a third party on the nintendo     goldeneye  developed by rare for nintendo  has been on the market for some time  its continued dominance in the sales charts is just one testament to how good this game is  and no review library would be complete without it  br    br   let  s face it    most of the time movie licensed games are flops  although the two seem like a good mix  the results  for the most part  have been horrendous  games like cliffhanger  true lies  lethal weapon  and not to mention all the star trek flops  are ammunition enough against this mix  and for the record i am not a fan of movie licensed games  especially if i  ve seen the movie  at least that  s how i used to think  in the case of goldeneye  i had more reservations than normal  while not a bad movie  goldeneye the film didn  t have that much appeal to it  and i don  t rank it in the top ten amongst bond movies  as a game  however  let  s just say it  s a completely different story  br    br   the game is a first person shooter  and in order to be successful  you  ll need at least as much brains as brawn  for those who have seen the movie  which i imagine is most of you reading this  the story is very consistent and follows the path of the movie with little variation  a plot to control the world  s most dangerous

to get you through the most grueling missions the world has ever known  m will brief you as soon as you  re ready  good day  james             this is an excellent film about the characters in a adult swimming class  their problems  relationships and interactions with each other  it should have managed a wider distribution as it  s much better than similar films from major studios out at the same time  br    br   the swimming instructor is an almost olympian  reduced to teaching adults basic lessons  and often the target of horndogging from his female students  he attempts  more or less  to fend them off  with varying results  br    br   the students characters are mainstream u s a  teachers  policemen  college students and retired people  all of whom haven  t learned to swim for some reason  the movie covers their relationships  including friends  relatives and romantic conquests as they go through the class  several subplots provide amusing fodder  including a teacher going through a divorce  some high school students making a documentary  and a girl who is only in the class to meet guys  br    br   this is a good date movie  or just one to watch when you  re in the mood for a romantic drama with overtones of reality             this mostly routine fact based tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole  this is the story of a highly trained military man  unhappy with his wife and children  fakes his demise and runs off with the other woman  to support her in the manner in which she is accustomed he robs banks  predictable  but not a bad watch             i watched six of a kind for w c  fields   he  s only in it for around    minutes and has one long scene  the infamous pool sequence he made famous in vaudeville  and several other great moments  the reamaining    minutes are also delightful  thankfully  mostly due to the hilarious charlie ruggles as the bumbling banker j  pinkham whinney  he is everyone  s foil  he stutters and stumbles about to our pleasure  also  his comedy partner  mary boland plays his wife  flora  joining in the proceedings are george burns and gracie allen  boland is particularly funny near the beginning and near the end  but gracie and ruggles use up most of the picture  gracie  s funny  quite  but she can also get tiring  and poor george burns has absolutely nothing to do except repeat gracie all the time  i don  t remember laughing at him once  although he has one great scene with ruggles  where ruggles tries desperately to get george to take gracie and leave him and his wife alone for a while  and one with fields  where he asks fields to sell him a sweater  that bit is exclusively fields    though   the situation is constantly funny  the whinneys are going to drive to california  but to help them with expenses  george and gracie are recruited                   edmund lowe  who reminds me somewhat of warren william   heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour  br    br   douglas walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise  hypnotism  anyone    and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast  everyone from virginia bruce  kent smith  frieda inescourt  gene lockhart  jessie ralph  benita hume  rosalind ivan and h b  warner  as an added bonus  there  s nat pendleton as a dimwit detective  and furthermore  get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home  must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film  br    br   on the plus side  the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled  it  s all suddenly clear to detective philo vance  and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense  br    br   nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner             this movie is lame and not funny at all  the plot doesn  t even make sense  some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension  maybe hell     and his daughter gets sucked through it or something  then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a skimpy outfit  i guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her   the main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she  s more interested in her new girlfriend  and they stumble upon this witch spell book  they want to be witches or something     and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the bikini top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop apparently  there is topless scenes for no reason and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely unnecessary  obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this pointless movie  i  m sure the topless girls doesn  t hurt there either  the extra features on the dvd were even more confusing than the rest of the movie  i thought it might help explain what was going on but it actually just made things more confusing  who are these people and what are they doing  basically this is a go camping to make out then fight a monster movie but there are a bunch of things  like the other dimension and book seller  than make it confusing  i didn  t like the movie but it was only like five bucks so big deal  i don  t recommend watching it though it was just too stupid  i can  t think of any part of the movie that was good             although i was hoping that i  d like it a little more  this was still certainly an impressive film  there were great performances by all the leads  and the story  while not what i  d call chilling  was still effective and it kept me interested  for me  the best part of this film was the look of the picture  for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well  i also thought that the low budget suited this movie  for i don  t think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim  all things considered  it fell a little short of my expectations  but i  m still very glad that i finally sat down to watch this movie             imagine this  a high school  except it  s boarding school  and the kids don  t have parents around  oh  and it  s in malibu  and the kids are all thin  white  and gorgeous  with the exceptional token minority or fat kid to play the   weird   outcast  and there aren  t any reasonable rules  like how they have co habitation  nuclear weapons in their dorms  coffee stands  a sushi bar  and a complimentary laptop per student  br    br   here  s the story  a girl  zoey brooks  attends pca  a formerly all boys school  absolutely perfect in every possible way  she is smart  pretty  thin  athletic  creative  and everything a perfectionist wants to be  almost all the boys in school want her  and every girl wants to be her friend  she  s the one everyone comes to for advice  the one who saves the day with a simplistic plan  and is just wonderful  too bad none of this makes her likable  br    br   are we supposed to believe that if we don  t even come close to zoey  s perfection  we  re bad people  in the show  nothing  s her fault  and if anyone contradicts her  they  re portrayed as the bad guy logan   he may be a jerk  but at least he has some kind of brain that thinks for himself instead of simply agreeing with the princess every time  br    br   her loyal group of blind followers are  chase  the average dumb ass that has a secret crush on her  michael  the token black guy  and the only decent actor on the set   lola  a wannabe actress and anorexic  snobby airhead  quinn  the smart but clueless girl when it comes to teen stuff  and logan  the rich jerk who has a soft side  yeah  this show basically spews out stereotypes  br    br   what ticks me off  though  is that they all try to pretend they  re normal kids  they complain that logan gets too much money while they have to work themselves  even though they already go to a too good to be true boarding school and have relatively nice things that many teenagers can  t afford  they drink coffee and eat sushi on a regular basis  hardly have homework  and suntan almost every day  wow  they have it hard  any other problems  i  m too good looking  rich  and stress free  i guess zoey      what  s the     for  anyway   is nick  s attempt at trying to portray teens realistically  except they caught a glimpse of reality  didn  t like it  and decided to give the kids lives like the asses on the hills  br    br   but hey  at least the set  s pretty             i had been amazed by director antal  s kontroll back in       his first american project  vacancy  was less impressive but a decent start  armored is his second feature and while the visual signature is recognizable  the film never rises above the level of a b movie   br    br   it  s a shame because the main premise has all the ingredients for twists and turns and the ensemble cast featuring many quality actors should be able to deliver  antal could have made a great heist film but instead goes for an action flick  then again he could have shot a cool action flick but it doesn  t really deliver in that department either   br    br   what you are left with is one implausible situation after another  a group of poorly sketched characters bicker and fight over a sum of money  if you look past the sharp cinematography  cast and the tight music score  you  re left with what could have been a below average direct to video featuring van damme or seagal   br    br   this was probably the most disappointing movie for me in quite some time             first of all  the reason i  m giving this film   stars instead of   is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo  he alone can get    stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie  br    br   i was initially all fired up at reading one poster  s comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave   the performance of his career    to me  it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie  and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment  then i thought to myself  what else has stevens done  so i checked and  you know  that person was absolutely right  in the    years since this columbo movie was made  apparently every one of the    projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap  so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career  br    br   if you like columbo  see every other of the    titles before watching this one  do yourself a favor and save the worst for last             this movie must be in line for the most boring movie in years  not even woody harrison can save this movie from sinking to the bottom  br    br   the murder in this movie are supposed to be the point of interest in this movie but is not  nothing is of any interest  the cast are not to bad but the script are just plain awful   i just sat in utter amazement during this movie  thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie entertaining  br    br   the producers of this movie were very clever  they made a boring movie but hid it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast  people will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think  woody harrison  kristin scott thomas and willem dafoe this must be good and rent this movie  boy are they in for a horrible time  br    br   if you like getting ripped off go and rent this movie  some people actually did enjoyed this movie but i like to watch a movie with meaning            down at the movie gallery  i saw a flick i just had to see  it looked like a fun low budget horror action western that i could get into  yeah  i knew it would suck  but i rented it anyway hoping for laughs  only a few laughs were to be found  this was an extremely stupid movie  it begins with a bounty hunter  our protagonist  who is possibly the weakest main character in the history of film  he looks acts like he could take on chuck norris  but he can  t  his dialogue sucks too  anyway  he goes into a village  shoots some zombies  you could tell they tried to make this longer by putting in these boring scenes where he takes     minutes to reload or watch some zombies  at least the zombies look cool  so anyway  some people get shot  some zombies die  and in the end  everyone is dead except our main character  who should have died at the beginning when he was shot down by four people             i am finally seeing the el padrino movie  from what i can see it is an incredible film  and lots of action damian chapa is good director  but i must admit i love his acting the best  br    br   also i saw the behind the scenes it was edited by some lady named kinga  she needs to go back to school and learn how to edit  br    br   however the film el padrino is a pure    action epic  why cant most people who direct put together films that keep you wondering what the plot is  i am so happy to see someone i know to be a real great actor become a great director also  br    br   i am one of those people who love to see artists make it  br    br   b s            i thrive on cinema    but there is a limit  a name isn t enough to make a movie   the beginning of the movie puts us in a mood to expect the unseen yet  but we remain hungry   or angry    till the end   things are getting so confused that i admit that i did not understand the end or was there an end to this nonesense  the opportunity to make an outstanding movie was there but the target was totally missed  next              michael callan plays a smarmy photographer who seems  nonetheless  to be regarded as a perfect   catch   by any woman that runs across him  could this have anything to do with the fact that he also co produced the film  he  s a   hero   whom it  s very difficult to empathize with  so the movie is in trouble right from the start  however  it  s troubles don  t end there  it has the production values of a tv movie  check out that head made of clay or something  near the end   and the ending cheats in a way that i can  t reveal  in case anyone wants to see the movie  highly unlikely   let  s just say that the killer knows more than we were let to know he knows                    i was drawn to   friends   by the soundtrack scored by a very young and yet to be famous elton john whom i had see in a club in nearby houston  i had no idea of the emotions and impact the movie would make  recently i was brought back to the movie by a song that heart did called   seasons    then i found the elton john song   friends   thinking it was the same song   it  s been    years of so  anyway  the flood of the emotions of   friends   came back like seeing an old photograph of your first real love  i have more recall of the way the movie hit me than i do of the actual details of the production  plot  etc  so forgive me for a rather poor review  i remember taking a couple of special friends on a date to see the movie and them being as moved and teary eyed at the end as i was  i  m both anxious and nervous to find a copy and see it now  so many movies which seemed so important to me back then  i e    the graduate     easy rider    now just seem silly and i don  t want this to fall into the same category  but  i will find it and if it turns out silly  then at least i  ll be able to turn my wife onto a great   no  outstanding soundtrack  when we met  we went through this with   last tango in paris    the youngsters i work with  i  m     respect my opinions but it  s hard to explain the feelings of the sixties and the movies and songs that reflect such strong feelings but seem a little   aged   now  i just can  t figure out if the the aging process is the movies    or me    friends   is a very special  sensitive and wonderful movie  it will bring back a lot of special feelings i  m sure  by all means  rent or buy a copy    indies were not near the strong genre then that they are today             during the clete roberts preface  i was beginning to think this was an ed wood production  however  what rolls out here is some pretty hard hitting stuff  the story of crime and corruption in a southern town is told using a cast culled from hollywood  s poverty row  and this makes the movie all the more realistic  there are no punches pulled here  and at times the film is reminiscent of   the well          the black and white texture gives a newsreel like quality  for certain  younger viewers will be reminded of   the blair witch project   but this one is based on real events             i decided to watch this one because it  s been nominated for oscar this year  i guess as many folks here i really wanted to like this movie  but ended up bored and disappointed  first scene was ok but the whole rest of the movie in   shaky hands   camera mode is really annoying  br    br   i guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for oscar is this  br    br   american   military machine    people  who makes money on war  urgently need an excuse or justification of war in iraq by bungling up something  sort of  patriotic  br    br   why these   heroic   efforts of director and the main character to  inspire  the audience with an idea of   loving war like a drug      oh  please  come on  what a bore   br    br   watch this to get an idea of how low the movie academy can fall               mom should really be given a different title to distinguish it from all the other movies out there called mom or with the word mom in the title  br    br   this is a vastly superior zombie movie to so much of the rubbish that gets churned out time after time and all end up much the same as every other zombie movie out there  br    br   it is so different and refreshing it almost defies categorisation  br    br   the kind old lady who takes in a creepy lodger  who just happens to be a flesh eater  who then infects the old lady who also turns into a flesh eating zombie  or ghoul  quite which exactly is not defined  br    br   there is pathos in the story as her son realises what she has become and while at first horrified  attempts to help her by supplying   food     i shall say no more about that  for fear of inserting a spoiler   it is one of those   quiet   movies as opposed to guns blasting  explosions raging  car chases  etc boring etc that makes so many movies all the same rubbish  but still with enough gory moments to satisfy horror fans  whilst also inserting sadness into the story  along with nice touches of humour as opposed to downright silliness of some so called   horror   movies  br    br   there is a particularly nice atmospheric shot at the beginning of the film  where the old lady is sitting alone in her room with only her christmas tree for company and looks so   innocent    but  what she becomes   oh my   br    br   a gem of a movie and even if not your thing  should at least be viewed if only once by any true horror fan             empire of passion starts out deceptively   that is  if you  re immediately expecting it to be a horror movie  it  s like a riff on james m  cain  s the postman always rings twice  at first  seki  kazuko yoshiyuki  is a mother of two and a dutiful  hard working wife to rickshaw driver gisaburo  takahiro tamura   but when he  s not around  and she  s at home with the baby  the feisty and aimless young man toyoji  tatsuya fuji  comes around to bring some goodies for seki    and a little extra  they  re soon sleeping together  but after he does something to her  let  s just say a   shave     he knows that he  ll find out  and immediately proposes that they kill gisaburo  they drink him up  strangle him  and then toss him down a well  naturally  this will come back to haunt them   but that it  s literally  at least to them  at first super terrified seki and then only later on skeptical toyoji   changes gears into the   kaidan    a japanese ghost story  br    br   this is a film where the horror comes not simply out of   oh  ghost  ah    but out of the total dread that builds for the characters  in a way there  s the mechanics of a film noir at work throughout  if only loosely translated by way of a   th century japanese village as opposed to an american city or small town  i e  the snooping cop  the   evidence   found possibly by another  word getting around  suspicions aroused  etc   it  s compelling because seiko actually was against the plan from the start  manipulated by the lustful but ill prepared toyoji  and her reactions to gisaburo  s re appearances are staggering to her  take the one that comes closest to poetry  gisaburo  s ghost  pale blue face and mostly silent  chilling stare  motions for seiko to get on the rickshaw  she does  reluctantly  and he pushes her around on a road she doesn  t know  in the wee hours before dawn  surrounded by smoke  most japanese ghost stories wish to heavens they could get this harrowingly atmospheric  br    br   while it starts to veer into hysterics towards the end  there  s so much here that director oshima gets right in making this a distinctive work  after hitting it huge in the international cinema world with in the realm of the senses  which  ironically  got banned in his own country   he made something that  he claimed  was even  more  daring that   senses    maybe he was right  empire of passion has less graphic sexual content by far than its predecessor  also starring tatsuya fuji  a magnificently physical actor with an immense lot of range   but its daring lies in crafting a world of dread  you can believe in ghosts in this story  but you also have to believe how far down to their own personal hells these two would be lovebirds will go  the snooping detective or the gossiping townspeople are the least of their worries  the fate of their very souls is at stake  br    br   and oshima takes what in other hands could be merely juicy pulp  sadly  it wouldn  t surprise me if an american remake was already in the works  and crafts shot after gorgeous shot  with repetition working its way into the mis en scene  i e  the shots of seiko and toyoji walking on that road  the camera at a dutch angle  the world tilted and surrounding them in a grim blue hue  as well as some affecting movements that will stay with me long after i finish typing this  i e  toyoji throwing the leaves by one hand into the well in slow motion  or how seiko  s nude body is revealed after she becomes blind   it  s daring lies in connecting on a level of the spirit  not to be confused with the spiritual  though there may be something with that as well  about life and death  s connections to one another  inextricably  it  s a classic waiting to be discovered             i am not a big music video fan  i think music videos take away personal feelings about a particular song   any song  in other words   creative thinking goes out the window  likewise  personal feelings aside about mj  toss aside  this was the best music video of alltime  simply wonderful  it was a movie  yes folks it was  brilliant  you had awesome acting  awesome choreography  and awesome singing  this was spectacular  simply a plot line of a beautiful young lady dating a man   but was he a man or something sinister  vincent price did his thing adding to the song and video  mj was mj   enough said about that  this song was to video   what jaguars are for cars  top of the line  perfecto  what was even better about this was  that we got the real mj without the thousand facelifts  though ironically enough  there was more than enough makeup and costumes to go around  folks go to youtube  take    mins  out of your life and see for yourself what a wonderful work of art this particular video really is             oh  my goodness  i would have never thought it was possible for me to see a thriller worse than domestic disturbance this soon  but here it is  armed with rotten plot  terrible editing  stilted acting  and headache inducing   style    sorry  i have no other words for it   sanctimony is the kind of movie that almost forces you to re evaluate an entire genre  that is  this film is so bad that even the thrillers i condemned as complete failures now seem a little better  br    br   now  not only sanctimony is a terrible film in itself  it also succeeds in the difficult task of ripping off better movies and do a pathetic job with it  right from the main titles    nothing but a blatant attempt to reproduce the ones from se en    i was under the impression that something didn  t smell quite right  as soon as the movie started with a series of corny  wanna be hip quick cuts full of gory images and bombastic colors  i knew where that smell was coming from  br    br   it turns out that two policemen  or rather policeman jim renart  michael par    and policewoman dorothy smith  jennifer rubin   are investigating on a murder spree in vancouver  a serial killer  known as   monkey killer    what a menacing  chilling nickname  uh   for his working methods  has killed quite a lot of people  you see  this nut apparently works following the proverb   see no evil  hear no evil  speak no evil   and cuts eyes  ears  and tongues out of his victims  so far  six eyes  six ears  and three tongues  in very ingenious fashion  renart and smith figure out that the monkey killer is probably going to kill other three people    well  because he probably wants to complete the number      so suddenly the film focuses on tom gerrick  casper van dien   a young  successful  good looking businessman  with a dreadful temper  and that  s where the rip off of american psycho kicks in  br    br   so we follow the life of the two police officers and the young psychopath  none of which is interesting in the least  until they finally meet  along the way to that  a disco where renart barely misses gerrick unintentionally offers us one of the funniest scenes in recent memory  renart goes in the back of the disco club  because    well  just because the script tells us it  s a suspect place  then  with one single punch in the stomach  renard gets rid of a big guard who blocks the path  and the guard is never heard of again  does this scene strike anyone else as completely unrealistic  br    br   anyway  after another murder  gerrick turns in as a witness  but smith and especially renart immediately suspect he might be the killer  in typical basic instinct fashion  smith gets some dates with the young businessman  under the assumption that she might discover his true identity  br    br   i won  t spoil the ending but it is  quite simply  an embarrassment  there are contradictions  some plot holes  issues that never get resolved  and especially there is one last scene where a brutal mass murder  supposed to be shocking and sad  comes off as such laughably overdone and nonsensical that i frankly can  t imagine how anyone could not laugh at it  br    br   at    minutes  sanctimony is really pushing it  you never care about one single character  because they are all so flat  not to mention boring  that you know exactly who is who the first time you meet them  you are never pulled into the story  because the scenes are connected through weak plot devices when not downright unnecessary and out of place  the acting ranges from average  van dien  to downright atrocious  rubin  and most of the supporting cast   the music is abysmal generic techno  and the photography is one of the worst i have ever seen  of course  like every fiasco of the genre  we are provided with a little bit of gratuitous nudity  br    br                   the man with a golden arm was one of a trio of great films around that same time that dealt with drug addiction  the other two were monkey on my back and a hatful of rain  but i think of the three this one is the best  br    br   maybe if otto preminger had shot the thing in the real chicago instead of those obvious studio sets the film might have been better yet  who knows  maybe preminger couldn  t get enough money to pay for the location  it  s the only flaw i find in the film  br    br   frank sinatra is a heroin addicted card dealer who was busted for covering for his boss robert strauss when the game was raided  he took the cure while in jail and wants a new life as a jazz drummer  but a whole lot of people are conspiring against him  br    br   first bob strauss who wants him back dealing  especially because a couple of heavyweight gamblers are in town  he uses a few underhanded methods to get sinatra  s services back  secondly darren mcgavin is the local dope dealer who wants sinatra good and hooked as a customer again  and finally eleanor parker his clinging wife who  s working a con game to beat all  just to keep him around  br    br   frank sinatra got a nomination for best actor for this film  but lost to ernest borgnine in marty  sinatra might have won for this one if he hadn  t won for from here to eternity in the supporting actor category a few years back and that marty was such an acclaimed film in that year  his scenes going through withdrawal locked up in kim novak  s apartment will leave you shaken  br    br   eleanor parker does not get enough credit for her role  she  s really something as the crazy scheming wife who wants sinatra tied to her no matter what the cost  if she had not been nominated that same year for interrupted melody  she might have been nominated for this       marked the high point of her career   br    br   darren mcgavin got his first real notice as the very serpentine drug peddler  his performance is guaranteed to make your flesh crawl  br    br   elmer bernstein contributed a great jazz score to accentuate the general dinginess of the bleak chicago neighborhood the characters live in  not a place you  d want to bring up your family             this film was basically set up for failure by the studio  one  anne rice  author of the book  offered to write the screen play but was refused by the studio  two  they tried to stuff   in depth novels in to a  hour movie  br    br   i maintain the only way for these two books  vampire lestat and queen of the damned  to work in a live action form would be through a mini series  first off the the vampire lestat alone takes place from the       s to the       s and has a plethora of character vital to the plot understanding of the main character  lestat  the entire book vampire lestat sets up the events of the second part queen of the damned  without that full understanding the premise of a movie is destroyed  br    br   lestat was not cruel and vicious to all  he was not wanting to go along with akasha  s plans  marius did not make lestat  lestat did not love jesse or make her  lestat could not go remain unscathed by the light  marius was not after david nor the other way around  every character was completely represented wrong  basically same names different story  br    br   if they wanted to make a vampire movie  fine  even if you wanted to be inspired by these novels  fine  but don  t piggie back into the theaters off the success of rice  s great novels and characters just to destroy what her loyal readers have come to love  br    br   if you haven  t read the books you won  t understand the film really  if you have read the books you will be insulted  that being said  i am such a huge fan i had to see the movie knowing full well this was going to be the case and still went for it  catch     must see it  will hate it             have previously enjoyed wesley snipes in several action flicks and i had expected a lot more  even from a score of     imdb  the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal  the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a   worst case scenario   of playing   strong   feelings accompanied by some bad acting    don  t waist your time this movie   xadsnt entertaining  if you wanna cry it might suffice though  even though your tears will be wept due to seeing wesley snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy    br    br   i give this      it really was awful  if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it  its all the good things this movie isn  t             an intense thriller about a mute movie make up artist who witnesses a snuff film being made when she is working late in the studio one night  after she tries to get away from the murder scene  she realizes she is in for more than she bargained for when the entire mafia is out to kill her for being a witness  this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat             don  t listen to most of these people  ill give you a better review of this movie which me and my friend love  its about jill johnson  played by camilla belle  who babysits at the mendrakis   house and someone breaks in  if you  re wondering how he got in the house  he went through the garage most likely  so anyway  don  t listen to    the worst acting    it has amazing acting  with a great story  i think that there are   benefits that jill has     shes a fast runner and is on the track team    she got out alive  lol  br    br   it is a cool movie and quite scary  check it out  you will be happy with this masterpiece  don  t listen to the other people on the site  its very good  trust me  i am good at reviewing movies  i  m a future movie critic  i totally want to buy this movie  and you will too when you see it  it is amazingly awesome             what a frustrating movie  a small southern town is overflowing with possibilities for exploring the complexities of interpersonal relationships and dark underbellies hidden beneath placid surfaces  as anyone who has read anything by carson mccullers already knows  this does none of that  instead  the writers settled for cutesy twinkles  cheap warm fuzzies and banal melodrama  the thing looks like a made for tv movie  and was directed with no particular distinction  but it  s hard to imagine what anyone could have done to make this material interesting  br    br   the most frustrating aspect  though  is the fact that there are a lot of extremely competent and appealing actors in this cast  all trying gamely to make the best of things and do what they can with this  well  there  s no other word for it  drivel  a tragic waste of talent  in particular that of the great stockard channing             this movie starred a totally forgotten star from the     s  jack pearl  radio  s   baron munchausen    as well as jimmy durante  however        decades later  it  s being billed as a three stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today  film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful edna may oliver as well as zazu pitts  br    br   as for the stooges  this is a film from there very early days  before mgm had any idea what to do with the team  at this point  they were known as   ted healy and his stooges   as healy was the front man  fortunately for the stooges  they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man  read up on him  you  ll see what i mean  and the rest is history  within a year  they were making very successful shorts for columbia and executives at mgm were soon kicking themselves for losing the team  this sort of thing was a common occurrence at mgm  a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy  such as the films of buster keaton  laurel and hardy  abbott and costello and others   in fact  up until they left for columbia  mgm put them in a wide variety of odd film roles  including acting with clark gable and joan crawford in dancing lady  and  oddly  in this film they didn  t act as a team  they just did various supporting roles  such as larry playing the piano  br    br   this particular film begins with pearl and durante lost in the african jungle  when they are rescued and brought home  all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show  punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there  as for pearl  i could really see why he never made a successful transition to films  as he has the personality of a slug  but slightly less welcome   as for durante  i never knew what the public saw in him  as least as far as his films are concerned  he was loud and   loud  he apparently took time off from helping mgm to ruin buster keaton  s career to make this film  together  pearl and durante rely on lots of verbal humor    and vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat  br    br   in this film  the stooges they didn  t yet have the right chemistry  seeing healy doing the job that moe did in their later films is odd  what they did in the film was pretty good  but because all the segments were short  they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines  stooges fans might be very frustrated at this  though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything stooge  even the rotten joe derita and joe besser films  oh  and did they got bad after the deaths of shemp and curly   br    br   overall  the film is rather dull and disappointing  however  there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess  at about the    minute mark  you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing  look carefully  as this is walter brennan in a role you  d certainly never expect  another unusual thing to look for in the film is the   clean as a whistle   song starting at about    minutes into the film  this song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called   pre code   scene that never would have been allowed in films after       when the production code was strengthened   despite the word   clean   in the title  it  s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh  enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything  it  s quite shocking when seen today  though such excesses were pretty common in the early     s  finally  at the    minute mark  see jimmy durante set race relations back a few decades  see the film  you  ll see that i mean             when carol  vanessa hidalgo  starts looking into her brother  s death  she begins to suspect something more sinister than   natural causes    the closer she gets to the truth  the more of a threat she becomes to her sister in law  fiona  helga line   and the rest of the local satanists  they  ll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways  br    br   if you  re into sleazy  satanic themed movies  black candles has a lot to offer  the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft core sex  one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed  unfortunately  all the sleaze in the world can  t save black candles  most of the movie is a total bore  other than the one scene i  ve already mentioned  the numerous sex scenes aren  t shocking and certainly aren  t sexy  the acting is spotty at best  even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance  the plot really doesn  t matter  its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together  i  m only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz  compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror  black candles comes off as amateurish       is about the best i can do             one of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history  zodiac killer offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers  the filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer  and anyone who remembers zodiac will be intrigued  others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal  unlike many serial killers  zodiac was not insane at all but very methodical and a self promoter  the director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off  the film is constructed as a murder mystery  or a   cold case   style thriller  it is an intelligent investigative procedural style horror film that will put off gore hounds in search of cheap thrills  br    br   some people dislike any movie that is shot on video  this attitude is very old style and provincial  it is an attitude and view of movies that puts technical issues above entertainment value or artistic value  these attitudes are on the way out  zodiac killer is a low budget film  no doubt  but discerning viewers will look beyond that and find a carefully crafted gem             i  ve read the other reviews and found some to be comparison of movie v real life  eg what it takes to get into music school   britney bashing  etc  etc  so let  s focus on the movie and the message  br    br   i have rated this movie   out of    for the age range   to    years  and for a family movie  for the average adult male       out of     br    br   i like pop rock music  i  m     i know of britney spears but never realised she actually sang stronger until i read the credits and these reviews  i didn  t recognise her poster on the wall so i was not worried about any   self promotion    br    br   i watch movies to be entertained  i don  t care about casting  lighting  producers  directors  etc  what is the movie and does it entertain me  br    br   i watched this movie for the message  the world  s greatest epidemic is low self esteem  which is a whole other story  so watched with the message in mind  as that is an area of interest  the movie is light  bright and breezy  great for kids  i found the texan twang began to fade throughout the movie and of course there are only so many ways to convey the give up don  t give up message  so yeh  it was a bit predictable  great message though   should be more of them  br    br   this movie is a great family movie  but for a bloke watching by himself  get hannibal             i like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema  made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies  it is filled with super surfer greg noll  s home movies  and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his    year passion  nevertheless  it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory  it is filled with artistic talent  and athletic talent  however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic  surfers are not astronauts nor test pilots  nor are they surgeons perhaps  or ph d  s again  perhaps   it believes in the quest of the surfer  it believes in the beauty of human goofiness  it believes in the great gift of peace  which comes from the cessation of war  surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an hawaiian island attacked by japanese zeroes fifteen years before  it celebrates the down time of a country which fought a cold war instead of a hot war   with the russian socialists  surfing is the ultimate narcissism  it is dangerous  but only slightly historical  i suspect alexander the great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique  he had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received  this movie has no military heroes  it has no guns  the only beach head surfers conquer has a beer stand and and a surfboard shop  this is not a problem  peace is not desperate  it is the joy of exhalation             i had a hard time staying awake for the two hour opening episode  it was dumbed down to such an extent  i doubt if i learned a single thing  the graphics were rudimentary  any small idea was repeated ad nauseum  contrast this to the cosmos series hosted by carl sagan  that had a good musical theme  there was no music coming from these infernal    dimensional strings             although the plot of this film is a bit far fetched  it is worth seeing just for the performances of michaels caine and gambon  the latter delivers a truly wonderful dublin accent  caine hams it up   which is exactly what the character he is playing should do  entertaining and fun  this is a hour and a half of easy watching             this movie was so badly written  directed and acted that it beggars belief  it should be remade with a better script  director and casting service  the worst problem is the acting  you have jennifer beals on the one hand who is polished  professional and totally believable  and on the other hand  ri  chard  who is woefully miscast and just jarring in this particular piece  peter gallagher and jenny levine are just awful as the slave owning  and keeping  couple  although both normally do fine work  the actors  and director  should not have attempted to do accents at all  they are inconsistent and unbelievable  much better to have concentrated on doing a good job in actual english  the casting is ludicrous  why have children of an   african   merchant  thus less socially desirable to the gens de couleur society   been cast with very pale skinned actors  while the supposedly socially desirable marcel  has pronounced african features  including an obviously dyed blond   fro    it  s as if the casting directors cannot be bothered to read the script they are casting and to chose appropriate actors from a large pool of extremely talented and physically diverse actors of color  it  s just so weird  this could be a great movie and should be re made  but with people who respect the material and can choose appropriate and skilled actors  there are plenty of good actors out there  and it would be fun to see how jennifer beals  daniel sunjata and gloria reuben would do with an appropriate cast  good script and decent direction             when i was a younger oh about   i watched barney for the first time  and liked it  but  back then i didn  t exactly have a brain  either  and now i look back and see what a horrible show   barney   really is  first of all  everything on that show is creepy  barney  the main character  is a horrendous   foot tall talking  purple dinosaur that teaches    year olds about   imagination        shudders   b j  i know what your thinking about his name  is a smaller yet creepier yellow dinosaur that is put in to be   supposudly   cool  but in fact  he is the exact opposite  after watching a few episodes with b j  dumbly trudging in with his slightly turned back cap  and making a few no so funny jokes  i wanted to scream  baby bop oh oh god   vomits  oh oh oh anyway baby bop is the worst idea of a character ever  she is a green triceratops it  s a dinosaur  that carries a yellow blanket  her remarks of   hee hee hee   and barney  s praises cries of   super deeee doooper    make it hard to sit through each episode  as the seventh graders learn about shapes and manners  br    br   and that  my friend  is what makes this show truly horrible             steve mcqueen has certainly a lot of loyal fans out there  he certainly was a charismatic fellow  one of the most charismatic the big screen ever knew  but even mcqueen can  t save this turkey of a film  shot with what looks like a brownie camera in the actual locations in st  louis  br    br   mcqueen  s a new kid with no criminal record brought into the planning of a bank heist by one of the other gang  there  s more than a broad hint that there  s a gay relationship going on between young steve and david clarke  he  s not liked at all by the other heist members  mainly because of his lack of criminal resume   br    br   steve also has a girl friend in molly mccarthy and she suspects something afoot  especially when he starts hanging around with crahan denton and james dukas as well as clarke  all pretty rough characters  that would certainly get my suspicions aroused  br    br   the great st  louis bank robbery had two directors charles guggenheim and john stix  guggenheim did mostly documentaries and stix didn  t do much of anything  one of those two jokers decided steve  s performance was best served by doing a bad marlon brando imitation   br    br   this film may go down as the worst ever done by steve mcqueen  i  m willing to bet that dick powell and four star productions had already signed him for wanted dead or alive because i can  t believe they would have if they saw this  br    br   or they would have seen something the public would have overlooked except for the dressing for this turkey             this is a bad film  as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts  as a result  it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film miss dunne or mr  huston should have been proud of making  however  the film is worth watching if you are a fan of   pre code   films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls do put out  even if they aren  t married and even if their partner is    br    br   the film begins with miss dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to europe for wwi  in the process  she meets a scalawag  bruce cabot  who eventually convinces her to sleep with him  she becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman  however  miss dunne does not want him back  as she realizes he  s not worth it  but later her baby dies at child birth  while all these very controversial plot elements are used  they are always alluded to  almost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way  kids in the audience will be clueless  after all  films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this time   br    br   surprisingly  this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and cabot ends about     of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to  it was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned it  tacking it on to still another film  in this second phase of the film  miss dunne unexpectedly begins working at a women  s prison  though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there   what we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate  and  as a result of all this violence  miss dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writer  br    br   but then  out of the blue  another type of film emerges and the women  s prison reform business goes by the wayside  dunne meets a judge  walter huston  who is married but he desperately wants her  now throughout the film  dunne is portrayed as a very good girl  even though she did have unmarried sex with cabot  she was more or less tricked into it   but now  single irene  who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man  he tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only  but she never thinks to investigate if this is true  and with his assurance  off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business  but  while she  s pregnant with his love child  he  s indicted for being a crooked judge  he assures her he  s innocent  but he  s convicted and it sure sounds like he  s a scoundrel  using inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune  then  in the final moments of the film  miss dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until huston is released  the film then ends  br    br   so  we basically have three separate films and a bizarre early   s idea of what a nice girl should be like  i gathered that she should be a strong minded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships  this really undoes all the positives about dunne  s character and it  s really hard to imagine anyone liking the film  a strong women  s rights advocate might easily be offended at how weak minded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect  with a decent re write  this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film  but it couldn  t make up its mind what it wanted to be and was just another dull pre code film             i caught this movie on the sci fi channel recently  it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as b list horror suspense films go  two guys  one naive and one loud mouthed a    take a road trip to stop a wedding but have the worst possible luck when a maniac in a freaky  make shift tank truck hybrid decides to play cat and mouse with them  things are further complicated when they pick up a ridiculously whorish hitchhiker  what makes this film unique is that the combination of comedy and terror actually work in this movie  unlike so many others  the two guys are likable enough and there are some good chase suspense scenes  nice pacing and comic timing make this movie more than passable for the horror slasher buff  definitely worth checking out              very mild spoilers  a basic plot outline  no real details   br    br   if you go into this movie with sufficiently low expectations  i saw this film at a free screening a few days ago in maryland  and the only reason i agreed to go   was because it was free  i expected a few chuckles  but as i have never been a huge fan of tenacious d  not much more then that  br    br   the first ten minutes of the film are hilarious  as we are given a look at jack black  s humble christian origins in a midwest american town  the film then takes us years into the future  to the first meeting between jb and kyle gass  the second half of tenacious d  we see the formation of the band and the genesis of its name  finally  as the title suggests  the second half of the film details their quest to obtain the fabled   pick of destiny    again  the beginning of the film was laugh out loud funny  and most of the movie at least kept a smile on my face  that said  there were times it felt a bit long  it  s only     minutes  but it still felt like it should have been a bit shorter  the story is every bit as absurd as it sounds  and this is not a film you see if you want a real plot  which is fine  except it means that many of the jokes are very hit or miss   and when they miss  they miss bad  same thing with the songs  it is a musical  but many of the songs lost their appeal after the first minute or so   then kept going anyway  br    br   i will say that the r rating really saved this movie from bombing  the d  s humor simply couldn  t work without cussing  sex  and drug references  but unless you  re a real fan of the band  or at the very least know you appreciate their style of comedy  i would recommend you save yourself some money and rent    pick   will make you giggle a bit   but is it worth   bucks  i don  t think so  i was tempted to rate it a    but since i do think that many would enjoy it enough to justify seeing it in theatres  a   seems more appropriate  just be sure it  s your style             i shall begin with a disclaimer  this movie is not recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played ff  the game before watching  the movie relies on the audience  s knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements  and it does so very subtly  do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of cg film and i promise it  ll be that much better  br    br   with that in mind  this film has some of the most spectacular cg sequences i have ever witnessed  the whole experience felt like an extra long fmv sequence from the game  on steroids  yeah  the attention to detail in each scene  especially in the heavy action oriented ones  is so impeccable it left me with a sense of awe  br    br   i believe the soundtrack is simplified so as to help the audience focus on the animation quality more than the music  again  for those who are familiar with the ff  story and background  the music should not surprise anyone  although the timing and placement of each soundtrack from the original accompany each scene and mood to the point where the music simply enhances the animation   br    br   once again  i myself having only played through ff  once  thoroughly enjoyed this piece of art from square enix  and that is the feel in most scenes  choreographed and organized  like a dance  br    br   in short  if you enjoyed the music or the game final fantasy    this film will blow you out of the water  if you  re in the unfortunate majority who has not experienced the goodness known as ff  on playstation or pc  doing so before watching the movie will allow for an exponentially greater experience  br    br   finally  i just want to make a note of the quality in animating this film  characters move with fluidity  each scene background comes to life and tells its own story  for those who criticize the thinness and dependency of the story plot  i urge you to reexamine the animation  facial reactions  subtle clues that bring about another level of entertainment above the typical narration method of story plot delivery  br    br   square enix and the great tetsuya nomura has set a new bar for quality animation and storytelling  advent children has ushered in a new era for cg animations  allowing the subtleties that lie in each character to speak volumes in and of themselves  br    br   thanks square enix  the wait was well worth it             this is quite possibly one of the worst movies ever made  everything about it  acting  directing  script  cinematography  is dreadful  the alien  a human in sparkly suit  claims to be from a nearby universe  one assumes the scriptwriter meant   galaxy   but didn  t bother to get a dictionary to check his terms  a better title for the film would be   it came from the planet of plot contrivances    the plot is excessively silly and nearly nonexistent  the humans are all given magical macguffins that conform to a tortuous series of unlikely restrictions just to move the bare plot  any thought to the passage of time is ignored  now it  s a couple days after meeting the alien  then bam  all of a sudden there  s only a couple hours left until zero hour  do yourself a favor and miss this movie  you will make yourself stupider for having watched it  the ending is particularly silly  and should have been accompanied by someone going   ta da       as the scriptwriter just pulls something random out of his butt  i think the real alien plot is that this movie sucks so bad you  ll get cancer watching it  if you can watch the last    minutes without crapping yourself    enemies of freedom    honestly  laughing  you  re retarded             if you really really really enjoy movies featuring ants building dirt mirrors  eating non ants  and conquering the world with a voice over narrative  then this is the movie for you  basically  a couple of scientists working out of a bio dome communicate with highly intelligent ants  the most intelligent actors in this film  in an attempt to try to thwart their plans of conquest and extermination  throughout the movie the two scientists  and a girl they rescued from the ants  use everything at their disposal  computers  green dye  and horrid acting   but to no avail  i guess they just couldn  t afford any pesticides because the movie would be over too quickly  br    br   the title of the movie   phase iv   is something of a mystery  this is not a spoiler  but   phase i   starts right after the opening credits whereas you don  t reach   phase iv   until the end credits roll  apparently the director knew the movie would be tedious to get through and so placed phases       throughout the movie as a kind of progress report    hang in there buddy  only   more phase until final credits    as a mst k episode  this one wasn  t very good for two reasons     this one is from the season   on ktma when they were first starting out so the riffing is not as good as in later seasons  and    this movie is so bad not even j tb can lighten it up  there are one or two gamera references as they had just finished riffing   gamera movies  br    br   the movie does have a trick surprise ending  but i was so glad to reach the end the effect was lost on me             joseph brady and clarence doolittle are two sailors  who have a four day shore leave in hollywood joe knows everything about girls and can  t wait to see lola  while clarence is shyer and needs some advice from his buddy on how to meet girls they then run into a little boy  donald martin  who has ran away in order to join the navy they take him home and meet his beautiful aunt susan  who wants to be a singer clarence wants susie to be his girl  but his shyness gets in the way but he doesn  t feel shy with a waitress  who comes from brooklyn  like he does soon joe notices he  s in love with susie the boys are in a fix when they lie to susie on meeting with a big time music producer they don  t even know as they are in a fix with their feelings george sidney  s anchors aweigh        is a great musical comedy gene kelly is top notch  once again  in his singing and dancing routines frank sinatra is terrific as the shy guy from brooklyn shy isn  t the first thing that comes to mind when you think of frank sinatra  but he plays his part well kathryn grayson is fantastic as susan abbott we sadly lost this gifted actress and operatic soprano singer last month at the age of    the   year old dean stockwell does amazing job as the little fellow wanting to become a sailor jose iturbi does great job performing himself it  s magic what he does with the piano edgar kennedy plays chief of police station sara berner is the voice of jerry mouse there  s a lot of great stuff in this movie and some fantastic singing and dancing numbers just look at kelly and sinatra performing   we hate to leave   it  s so energetic   if you knew susie  like i know susie    is quite funny it  s a nice moment when frank sings brahms   lullaby to little dean stockwell it  s lovely to listen to grayson singing the tango   jealousy    the most memorable sequence is the one that takes into the animated fantasy world  and there gene sings and dances with jerry mouse also tom cat is seen there as the butler they originally asked mickey mouse but he refused the movie was nominated for five oscars but georgie stoll got one for original music score anchors aweigh is some high class entertainment             from director barbet schroder  reversal of fortune   i think i saw a bit of this in my media studies class  and i recognised the leading actress  so i tried it  despite the rating by the critics  basically cool kid richard haywood  half nelson  s ryan gosling  and justin pendleton  bully  s michael pitt  team up to murder a random girl to challenge themselves and see if they can get away with it without the police finding them  investigating the murder is homicide detective cassie   the hyena   mayweather  sandra bullock  with new partner sam kennedy  ben chaplin   who are pretty baffled by the evidence found on the scene  e g  non relating hairs  the plan doesn  t seem to be completely going well because cassie and sam do quite quickly have richard or justin as suspects  it is just a question of if they can sway them away  also starring agnes bruckner as lisa mills  chris penn as ray feathers  r d  call as captain rod cody and tom verica as asst  d a  al swanson  i can see now the same concept as sir alfred hitchcock  s rope with the murdering for a challenge thing  but this film does it in a very silly way  and not even a reasonably good bullock can save it from being dull and predictable  adequate             things to come is an early sci fi film that shows an imagined world  or   everytown   through     years  you can break it up into about   different scenes or parts  the film spans from      to      and is mainly about how this ruler or the   boss   wanted to get the capability to fly in airplanes again  after everytown was bombed and war broke out  br    br   this film only has about   faults  it  s audio is muddy and video had some quirks  the characters aren  t deep at all  and the overall plot isn  t altogether solid  the plot is lacking something that i can  t put my finger on    it just seems a little   fluffy    but if you love sci fi and are interested in what h g  wells though might happened in the next hundred years  this is a must see  it  s worth seeing just to learn of what everyone was fearing  a long  drawn out war  because they were just about to go to war with germany  and there was a threat of biological weapons and everything  br    br   things to come is a pretty good movie that most people need to see once             weak stale  tired  cliched  wants to be basic instinct  but misses opportunity after opportunity for fresh perspectives  new insights  insipid  trite  grotesque  and without the possibly redeeming value of brevity  oh  wait   it was only    minutes long   it must have just  seemed  a lot longer  i  d rather clean bus station toilets with my toothbrush than have to sit through this again  i  m expressing an opinion here  i guess this means i didn  t like it             one word can describe this movie and that is weird  i recorded this movie one day because it was a japanese animation and it was old so i thought it would be interesting  well it was  the movie is about a young boy who travels the universe to get a metal body so he can seek revenge  on the way he meets very colorful characters and must ultimately decide if he wants the body or not  very strange  if you are a fan of animation science fiction you might want to check this out             while i was the video store i was browsing through the one dollar rentals and came upon this little gem  i don  t know what it was about it but i just had a gut instic about it and wow was i ever right  br    br   the story centers around two girls who have just survived a school shooting  one of the girls is alicia a teenage reble who is the only witness for the full attack and another is deanna another survivor who survived a bullet to the head by some miracle  thrown together by fate  they slowly begin a painful and beautiful display of healing and moving on  br    br   i just hate it when amazing movies fall through the cracks  because wow what a performance by busy phillips and erkia christensen not to mention the rest of the cast  my only complaint is that the dvd was sorely lacking in special features  oh and some of the jump cuts in the movie were kind of jarring  but all in all a excellent movie             this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today  not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors  so what went wrong  i don  t know and simply i don  t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all  be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish  but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot  a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father  s company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid  very stupid plot twists devices  i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience  if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather  what about lock  stock     thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film                 i  ll not comment a lot  what  s to    stereotype characters  absolute ignorance about colombia  s reality  awful mise en scene  poor color choice  not funny  it supposed to be a comedy and they expect that you will laugh because some distend music it  s beside the nonsense scenes   very poor actors direction  if you see somewhere those people  i mean the interpreters  you  ll know they are at least good  but seeing this so call film  it is impossible to guess it   you get tired of the music    this   comedy   has no rhythm  the only good rhythm in it  it  s the rap sing in the final credits    pathetic  doesn  t it  etc   etc    it has been a long time i haven  t seen a movie so bad              this movie is a riot  i cannot remember the last time i had such a great time at the movies  i  ve seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny  but this one is wall to wall great lines  i think best in show is the last movie that i laughed so hard and so much in  the movie was non stop until the end when they did the   minutes of sentimental plot clean up  other than that it  s a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations  i  d like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the zucker movies where you don  t get all the jokes the first time around  you have to see it two or three times to get it all in  br    br   as far as the actual film goes  it could have used a better edit  it  s choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that  all the characters are great  it  s not like an adam sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke  i think i will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable  no victims in this movie  also  thank god they got a    year old actress to play his girlfriend  catherine keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film  you just wish that women like her really existed  she  s not a        like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than julia roberts overdone overbite  br    br   if you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it  i assure you  the trailer does not do it justice  they do not give away all the good jokes  just some of the mediocre ones  br    br   oh and one more thing  i hope critics put this on their top ten list  many of them complain that comedies don  t get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they don  t put it on their list  this means you ebert               a fey story of a martian attempt to colonize earth   things must be pretty bad back on mars   two state troopers investigate the scene of a reported ufo crash  whatever landed is buried under the ice at tracy  s pond but there are footsteps in the snow leading to a nearby diner  br    br   the diner has had no customers since eleven o  clock that morning  now there are a handful of bus passengers sitting around waiting for permission to cross a structurally weak bridge  the bus driver insists that six passengers were aboard the bus  although he didn  t notice who they were  the problem is that there are now seven people waiting for the journey to be resumed  one of them is an alien  but which one  all of them are suspect  there  s the crazy old man  jack elam   of course  who seems to exercise a sub rosa wit  there  s a blustering businessman who must get to boston  john hoyt   a young couple on their honeymoon   execrable performance by the husband  ron kipling   except for the couples  nobody has noticed anyone else  and even the couples are suspicious of each other  bride to newly minted husband    i could have sworn you had a mole on your chin    the story continues in a sprightly but slightly spooky way    the phone rings for no reason  the lights go on and off  the juke box turns itself on    and none of it is to be taken seriously  br    br   it  s a thoroughly enjoyable ensemble play and the climactic revelation is worth a chuckle  there is no discernible   depth   to it  it  s not a moral message about pod people masquerading as normal citizens  it  s not a warning of any kind  just a fairy tale that diverts and amuses  br    br   i always enjoy it when it  s on  it  s especially interesting to see john hoyt as the irritable and impatient businessman  knowing that in      he was the roman senator who masterminded the assassination of julius caesar in mgm  s version of shakespeare  s play  and here he is    with three arms  br    br   oops             it  s rare that i feel a need to write a review on this site  but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created  and how bias its product was  br    br   i felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film makers to display the palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy  we hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression  yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the jewish israeli population  we see no evidence that parallels the position of the palestinian teenager  we only hear from other palestinians in prison  i understand restrictions are in place  but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace  br    br   i came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence  so to speak  she continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber  s parents  and her angry and closed minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control  it is more realistic  in my mind  to see the israeli mindset to be a root of the problem  ignored pleas for understanding and freedom  ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the jewish population acquired the land  br    br   i have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother  which normally would be admirable in a documentary  however in the light of the lack of impartiality  it all seems exploitative  also for the poor edits  lack of background in the actual instance  and finally the lack of proper representation of the palestinian side  ultimately  it is a poor documentary and a poor film  i acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation  but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart wrenching and sad subject matter             relentless like one of those loud action movies  the entire cast seems to be on speed  i didn  t quite get the director  s intentions if any  i wonder if she  s ever seen a stanley donen  vincent minnelli or even a george sidney musical  structure  please  this is one hell of a mess and i loved abba  the costumes the unflattering photography   unflattering towards the actors but loving towards the locations  the one thing that makes the whole thing bearable is the sight of meryl streep making a fool of herself  no chemistry with her friends  christine baranski and julie walters  think of streep with lily tomlyn in the altman film and you  ll understand what i was hoping for  i was embarrassed in particular by pierce brosnam and colin firth  the audience  however  seemed to enjoy it so it probably it  s just me             this movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space  as a history of space flight  it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it  disney has shown it on   vault disney   and i wish they would do so again             in an alternate     s  where an outbreak of the undead  caused by a mysterious   space dust    has been contained through the use of special electronic collars  a young loner  timmy  finds a friend in fido  billy connelly   his family  s recently acquired domesticated zombie  br    br   fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy  whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son  or for his hot to trot wife  played by the gorgeous carrie anne moss  having been psychologically scarred as a child  when he was forced to shoot his own father  who tried to eat him    br    br   timmy runs into a spot of bother  however  when his putrid pal  s collar goes on the blink  and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour  with the authorities on fido  s trail  trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies  and his mother forming a bond with their undead house help  will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend  br    br   a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick  fido is a thoroughly entertaining  deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour  taking the romero zombie verse and transplanting it into     s small town america is a stroke of genius  and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole   reanimated dead   theme that i have seen  br    br   connelly  s fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame  along with day of the dead  s bub  and return of the living dead  s tarman  it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse  but the big yin  s performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus  the rest of the cast also give commendable performances  with young k  sun ray  as timmy  and ms moss deserving special mentions  ray  because  for one so young  he puts in a particularly assured turn  and moss because she is so bloody yummy  br    br   this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week  the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead   and  to my surprise  it is also the best  director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future  br    br       out of     rounded up to   for imdb             an extremely down to earth  well made and acted   rodeo   western  no gussied up stars needed here as all cast members were regular people telling a real life story about a rodeo hustler and his entourage in the     s and     s west  but hats off particularly to slim pickens for giving what i think was his signature performance  especially given the fact that he had been a rodeo clown in real life  his role went far beyond the mere clown role as he deeply dealt with all the   ups and downs   of the hard nosed rodeo life and the psychological devastation that so frequently surrounds such a life style  he and mr  coburn teamed up extremely well as partners  not only on the circuit itself  but also in the real world outside the corral  also  check out anne archer as coburn  s native american love interest in the latter part of the movie  must have been one of her first roles   br    br   not as flashy  perhaps  as   junior bonner    but equally heart rendering and impacting in its portrayal  thanks to the encore western channel for showing this true grit of an under rated movie from time to time             despite some reviews being distinctly luke warm  i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as   mills and boon    so what  it is good to see a warm  touching story of real love in these cynical times  many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes  you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other  even though  for political reasons  it was an arranged marriage  i did feel though that sir john conroy  who was desperate to control the young queen  is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain  as it is rumoured that he was in fact  the real father of victoria  as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent  it would have been interesting to explore this theory  emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess  trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her  she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england  which prospered as never before  under her long reign  i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie               american nightmare   is officially tied  in my opinion  with   it  s pat    for the worst movie of all time  br    br   seven friends  oddly resembling the k mart version of the cast of   friends    gather in a coffee shop to listen to american nightmare  a pirate radio show  it  s hosted by a guy with a beard  that  s the most exciting aspect of his show  br    br   chandler  monica  joey  and    oh wait  i mean  wayne  jessie  and the rest of the bad one liner spouting gang all take turns revealing their biggest fears to the bearded dj  unbeknownst to them  a crazed nurse serial killer is listening    br    br   crazy nurse then proceeds to torture ross and rachel and    wait  sorry again    by making their fears come to life  these fears include such stunners as   voodoo   and being gone down on by old ladies with dentures  br    br   no  really  br    br   this movie was  in a word  rotten  crazy nurse  s killing spree lacks motivation  there  s nothing to make the viewer   jump    the ending blows  and  again  voodoo  br    br   if you have absolutely no regard for your loved ones  rent   american nightmare   with them  br    br   if you care for your loved ones  even a little bit  go to your local blockbuster  rent all of the copies of   american nightmare   and hide them in your freezer             first off  i have to say that i loved the book animal farm  i read it with my  th grade class  and it was great  we also decided that watching the movie would be beneficial  the movie was so disappointing to me  the movie cuts out some characters  and misses a lot of the main points of the book  it skips around a lot  and doesn  t explain anything in detail  if someone was watching this movie without having first read the book  they would be confused  the most disappointing thing in this movie to me  was the ending  the ending in the book was the most powerful  and in the movie  they changed it  it was supposed to be the pigs and men in an alliance and sort of   melting   together  but instead  the movie made it seem like the animals were going to rebel against the pigs  to sum up  i don  t think that this movie captured the real meaning that orwell portrayed in his book             this movie was extremely boring  i only laughed a few times  i decided to rent it when i noticed william shatner  s name on the cover  it  s all about this little kid who gets picked on all the time by his classmates  when wandering the streets looking for old ladies to assist  he meets a prostitute  she takes him to a club called the playground  where he befriends several pimps  when mayor tony gold  shatner  decides to take over the pimp business  lil   pimp must lay down for his homies  br    br   the animation isn  t very good in this  it looks like it was made with macromedia  which i  m sure it was  it doesn  t suck  it  s just the sort of choppy flash animation that people have gotten used to over recent years  the humor in this is not very good  i didn  t think any of it was funny             i was disgusted by this movie  no it wasn  t because of the graphic sex scenes  it was because it ruined the image of artemisia gentileschi  this movie does not hold much truth about her and her art  it shows one piece of art work that she did  judith beheading holofernese  but shows that being entered as testimony in the rape trial when she did not paint her first judith for a year after the trial  br    br   i don  t know if you understood this from the movie  probably not  tassi was not a noble character  he raped artemisia  it was not love  it was rape  he did not claim to accept false charges of rape to stop her from suffering while she was tortured  according to the rape transcripts he continued to claim that he never carnally knew artemisia  aka had sex with  while she states over and over again   it  s true    br    br   i encourage all of you people to go out and find about the real artemisia and see what she is really about  don  t base all of your knowledge on this fictional movie  i encourage you to do some research  artemisia really does have interesting story behind her and some amazing art work  br    br   don  t see the movie  but find out the true story of artemisia             such a joyous world has been created for us in pixar  s a bug  s life  we  re immersed in a universe which could only be documented this enjoyably on film  but more precisely a universe which could only be documented through the world of animation  for those who have forgotten what a plentiful and exuberant world animation can offer    when it  s in the right hands that is    a bug  s life is a warm reminder  we walk out of the film with an equally warm feeling  and a sense of satisfaction derivative of only high calibre film productions  br    br   it is only pixar  s second animated feature  the sub group of disney made their spectacular debut and perhaps entirely inadvertent mark on the film world three years prior in       with their landmark movie toy story  it was a movie which defied convention  re invented and breathed new life into animation and defined a whole new level of excellence  now  they return with their sophomore effort which  to be honest  draws a creeping sense of cynicism in us all prior to seeing the film  br    br   after all  it  s a film about ants  well  all walks of the insect and bug world are covered in a bug  s life  but it is the ant which is the focal point in this film  as humans are the focal point in dramas  romances and so on  how can such an insignificant species of animal such as an ant act as the protagonist of a movie  let alone provide the entire premise of a feature film  surely they jest  however  we forget that in toy story  a bunch of toy box items were able to become the grandest  most inspiring and lovable bunch of animated heroes and villains ever concocted  the guys at pixar manage to pull off the same feat  and manage to turn a bunch of dirty and miniscule bugs into the most endearing and pleasant gang of vermin you  ll probably ever encounter  br    br   not only are they all entirely amiable and likable    there isn  t an unpleasant character in sight  even the villains are riveting characters    but they  re colourful  they  re eclectic  and they  re idiosyncratic  and the array of characters is also gargantuan for lack of a better term  only adding the rich layers of distinctiveness already plastered onto a bug  s life from the beginning  we shall start with our main character  and our hero  his name is flik  david foley   and his character is rather generic to say the least  out of the thousands of faithful and obedient worker ants residing on the lush  beautiful ant island  he is the one considered the   black sheep   of the clan  as seen in the opening moments of the movie when he inadvertently destroys the season  s harvest with his antics  br    br   the problem arises in the fact that the ants   harvest is for a bunch of greedy grasshoppers led by hopper  kevin spacey   who are eager to continue to assert their wrath and autocracy amongst the puny little ants  when they show up to ant island for their annual banquet and see that their offering is gone  they go insane  for lack of a better term  hopper offers a proposition to save the ants from total extinction at his pack  s hands  however  it  s a negotiation which is simply impossible to fulfil  the cogs and clockwork in flik  s mind run at full steam now despite his guilt and shame  and he offers to leave ant island in search of some mighty bug warriors who can come to the colony  s rescue and fight off hopper and the grasshoppers  br    br   if you think about it  a bug  s life bears some heavy resemblance to the plot line  s of akira kurosawa  s classic seven samurai  or the american remake the magnificent seven  in which a village of hapless but good hearted folk are threatened by malevolent and wicked enemies    one lone village dweller goes in search for help in the big city  finds it and returns to the colony to drive off evil  in a bug  s life  the help comes in the form of a down and out circus troupe who is mistakenly perceived by flik as warriors in a bar room brawl  br    br   much amusement comes out of these scenes  and much amusement comes out of these circus troupe bugs  among them are an erudite stick insect  david hyde pierce   a side splitting obese german caterpillar by the name of heimlich and a quasi femme fatale ladybug who  s in fact a gritty and masculine ladybug  dennis hopper   it  s exceedingly enjoyable watching these bugs on screen  as it is watching the bugs and the insects interact on screen  as is the entire movie collectively  br    br   as i  ve said  much amusement and mirth comes out of their characters and joyous interactions with one another  which give way to a bevy of hilarious lines  wonderfully suspenseful and riveting situations and overall a dazzling movie  what makes a bug  s life even better is that the film isn  t restricted simply to children as many may perceive it to be  although children would indeed find more entertainment out of this film    the clich  d kid friendly situations are a bit more abundant than we  d like  however  it  s easy to ignore this fault  and it  s incredulously easy to enjoy this film  br    br   although a bug  s life may not reach the dizzying and landmark standards set by its predecessor  this is still a superb movie  and the start of something promising here  pixar have proved that they  re not just a one hit wonder  but instead a much gifted and talented group of film artists in hollywood  they raise the bar endlessly  and when someone always manages to top their standards  it  s only always by themselves  what more is there to say about a bug  s life other than  see it  it  s not quite the best which we  ve seen from the folks at emeryville  california  but this beats out the lot of its year    and i  ll be damned if this isn  t the best animated feature of       br    br                    what an empty and lack lustre rendition of the classic novel  i do wish people would stop messing about with classics when they clearly have no idea of the real intention or point of the original  this version is no different  i felt that the ralph fiennes version is much worse though as the casting of juliette brioche as kathy has got to be the worst casting decision ever   anyway back to this version  it aims to make the story relevant to a contemporary setting and in a musical style  it succeeds in both but high art it is nit  throwaway viewing for a rainy day maybe   the direction was average and the editing abysmal  worse than the old quincy  deepak verma does a great turn as hindley and is in fact one of britains wasted talents  the part of heath was played with great charm and belief and i think that the casting is the strongest point of this project  although a more talented director would have made better use of the facilities he had  its clear that he was a director for hire and didn t instill the project with the passion that it deserved            my father the hero used to be my favorite movie when i was younger  it  s about andre  a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter  katharine heigl  on a vacation  hoping to get a little closer to her  but of course  nicole isn  t that easy to get along with  she just started puberty  i  m guessing  she is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time  one day at the beach  nicole meets handsome ben  and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad  the whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie  i would give my father the hero                 it is surprising that a production like this gets made these days  especially for television  considering the strong sexual themes and explicit lovemaking scenes  not to mention lesbianism  this has been given superb treatment and direction  br    br   the sets and costumes are flawless  the direction is stylish and the characters are likeable  there is a fair amount of humor but it has surprisingly dark interludes  the protagonist is really a tragic figure  but not devoid of happiness  also  this production avoids the mistake most films shows make when dealing with homosexuality lesbianism  the characters are very human  it seems that to allow people to be comfortable with watching gays and lesbians on tv and movies most shows fill it full of cliches and make the characters obsessed with being gay  not so with this  in tipping the velvet  the protagonist is hardly aware of what being lesbian means  br    br   the bbc have made some wonderful productions in the past  and this adventurous period piece only confirms their standard of excellence on all fronts             i just don  t get some of the big premises of this episode   that miranda is so remarkable  and that there  s anything so ugly it would make you insane  someone here made the remark that maybe it  s the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness  miranda is just a jerk  the episode is slow  inconsistent and way too talky  i also don  t quite understand why kolos is an ambassador   why doesn  t the federation just leave the damn medusans be  there  s one part i do like  when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience  overall  i love tos and even at its lamest  i  ll always tune in  this episode though   mmm  i wouldn  t purchase it except for a used copy under                this is one of my all time favorite movies and i would recommend it to anyone  on my list of favorite movies  mental list  mind  the only ones on par with it are movies such as the lord of the rings series  spirited away and fly away home  br    br   i can really relate to the main character jess  at the start of the movie she  s a shy girl with a slightly odd background who has a lot more friends who are boys than that are girls  she really sucks you into her life  i also certainly can  t fault any of the protagonist  s acting  or anyone else  s in the film  br    br   the soccer was interesting to watch even for someone like me who has no idea of the rules  the movie is never boring  the romance is really cute and didn  t make me blush tooooo hard  one thing that really made it though was the indian factor  jess   parents are indian and there are many colourful indian conventions throughout the film providing a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else  the indian people are also hilarious  essentially this is a coming of age film about choosing the path you want and fighting for it  br    br   feel good comedies are becoming my favorite movie genre thanks to this film  they  re funny  they  re refreshing and they make you feel good                 i know that you  ve already entered this in film festivals  or at least i think you have  i may just be making that up  but i think this should get   best animated short film   in every one  bravo  i can  t wait for the full film  i realize that you may not hear this often enough because of the bizarre nature of your animations  but hear it now and accept it as the truth  kudos  my friend  okay  now i  m just trying to get ten lines of text    though i still mean it  and here comes yet another  shoe   and i cannot stop here yet  this is extremely annoying and yet at the same time i have nothing better to do  in fact  i  ll probably watch all of your movies in yet another spasmodic   jason steele marathon    i do have a lot of those  br    br    r            this is probably the first entry in the   lance o  leary nurse keat   detective series  in subsequent o  leary films  he was played by much younger actors than guy kibbee  br    br   a group of relatives  all played by well known character actors  gathers in an old house  on a rainy nite  of course   to speak to a wealthy relative  who goes into a coma  br    br   while they wait for him to recover  all sorts of mysterious goings on happen  including a couple of murders  br    br   a creepy film  worth seeing             this animation has a very simple and straightforward good vs  evil plot and is all about action  what sets it apart from other animation is how well the human movements are animated  it was really beautiful seeing the fleeing woman running around on the screen from left to right and look around  her movements were done so well  why don  t they use this rotoscopic technique more these days  it  s quite effective  br    br   fire and ice  in it  s prehistoric setting and scarcely dressed women  was clearly devoted to showing the beautiful damsel in distress in various sexy ways  her voluptuous body serving as pure eyecandy  some may hate this and regard it as yet another moronic male sexual fantasy  others  including plenty of women  will adore it  s esthetic quality  i for sure did not mind  bakshi just loves animating lushious  voluptuous babes  as can also be seen in cool world  and i don  t think he has to apoligize since it  s pretty much animation for adults  but i had also enjoyed this animation as a child and i never forgot it  br    br   this one was just special  so different from the standard disney or anime fare  and for that reason alone well worth the watch since it  s possibly bakshi  s finest  for those who like animations with lushious women  try space adventure cobra as well  br    br   i give fire and ice   out of                my ratings  acting        suspense        character attachment        plot        character development        overall        br    br   this show sucks very much officially  for me  csi miami is the best  csi ny  nd and csi    th  i don  t know  in the other csis you get into the episode you  re watching  but in this one  you just can  t get into the episode  no matter how much you try  so in my opinion  this show is not worth watching  i know people have different opinions  and i respect that  but for me  this csi ain  t good enough  so if you like suspense  real acting performance  good plot  direction  character development attachment and you an overall good show  i suggest you to watch csi miami             i am not a faulkner fan  which is considered sacrilegious  especially since i grew up near the author  s hometown   however  i think this is an excellent movie  on par with the quality of the movie   to kill a mocking bird    if you haven  t seen it  buy it anyway  it  s well worth having in your permanent collection  tcm recently played the movie as a part of the race on film series  i wish they  d play it more often  very moving  br    br   on a side note  the folks from oxford  mississippi  will also enjoy seeing the footage of the town square as it was back in the       s  the courthouse  city hall  etc   they  re all on screen  i never knew the movie was filmed there until i noticed the familiarity of the buildings  when i saw the arch in the front of city hall  i began to get suspicious  look closely at the pennants on chick  s wall  you  ll see two for ole miss              chinese ghost story iii is a totally superfluous sequel to two excellent fantasy films  the film delivers the spell casting special effects that one can expect  but fails painfully on all other fronts  the actors all play extremely silly caricatures  you have to be still in diapers to find their slapstick humor even remotely funny  the plot is predictable  and the development is sometimes erratic and often slow  towards the end  the movie begins to resemble old godzilla films  including shabby larger than life special effects and a  well  yet another  ghost with a godzilla head  maybe i would have grinned if i was expecting camp  br    br   it is astonishing to see what trash fantasy fans have to put up with   in this case because somebody thought they could squeeze a little extra money out of a successful formula  they won  t be able to do it again  the cash cow is now dead as a dodo             i can  t stand most reality shows and this one is worst than the one with paris hilton  and sure it  s his company  but   you  re fired   or   you  re hired    for how many seasons now  after watching the show i wouldn  t want to work for the guy with his ego and all and i think watching paint dry has more entertainment valve  br    br   i  d love to hear just one person get up and say   donald i quit and take some of your money and buy a decent hairdo    i see he  s even trying to buy fame in the wrestling wwe  i hope he gets hurt so i don  t have to see his pathetic face anymore  it must be sad to want fame so bad and have no talent and make an ass of yourself trying to buy it  i  d give this show a negative mark if i could but it gets a   and it doesn  t deserve that             if i had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing dogme    style  i would never have rented it  nevertheless  i took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot  i lasted a very  very  very long forty minutes before giving up  it  s just boring  pretentious twaddle  br    br   the last french movie i saw was   romance   and it too was pretty dismal  but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time  i am baffled at the continuing popularity of dogme    overseas    it  ll catch on in america about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy   it  s called dogme    because that  s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera   br    br               the story and the show were good  but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies  ri  chard is great  he really put on a top notch performance  and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous  seriously  i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile  i can  t say anything bad about peter galleghar  he  s one of my favorite actors  i love anne rice  i  m currently reading the vampire chronicles  but i  m glad i saw the movie before reading the book  this is a little too  real   for me  i prefer lestat and louis  s witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves  eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me  i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show   sorry for the ambiguity  but i don  t want to give anything away  sorry  but it  s just not my type of show             first  let me just comment on what i liked about the movie  the special effects were fantastic  and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game  there  that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film  in fact  i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can  t even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing   br    br   i have innumerable complaints about the film  but four major complaints jump to mind  my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the   plot twist    if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away  where lois  s   year old son turns out to be the super powered child of superman  when the crying super child throws a piano at lex  s henchman to save his mother  i almost got up and left the theater  singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super powered illegitimate child  it  s been   days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit   br    br   my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space  it doesn  t take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what  s wrong with that  i don  t know how many comic books brian singer has read  but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet  whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman related projects ever again  the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun  why not just have superman eat kryptonite  he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it  and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas  that  s not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground   br    br   my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie  i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god like jor el sent to earth to be a savior  jor el wasn  t all wise  he was just a scientist  and he didn  t send his son to earth to be a savior  he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode  i  ll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode  and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ  s primary weakness  furthermore  the   crucifixion   scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite   spear   just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i  m too brain dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future  they might as well rename this movie   superman returns  the passion of the christ    br    br   and speaking of luthor  my last major complaint has to do with singer  s depiction of lex luthor  lex luthor is a shrewd  cold hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president  which he does in the comics  than try to destroy the world  the man wants money and power  he wants to be in charge  not wreck everything  yet the luthor we see superman returns  as well as all the previous superman movies  is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world  if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the  quite awful  previous superman movies  this film might not be such an unbearable travesty  maybe singer  s next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from     s tv show  zam  whap  pow   br    br   to summarize  i don  t know what i hate more  the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews  everyone is entitled to their opinion  but if you don  t hate this movie then your opinion is wrong  i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven  t already  don  t see it  don  t buy it when it comes out on dvd  don  t rent it   basically don  t contribute any money towards it in any way  this movie does not deserve to make any money  in fact  i think that for every person that sees this movie  bryan singer should be fined    billion dollars  if you  re a superman fan and you really want to see this movie  just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you  ll get the same experience without having to waste   hours of your time             this is one of the best tv productions of a musical ever  i have heard the merman cast album  the angela lansbury album  i have seen tyne daly live  and i  ve seen the rosalind russell movie countless times  i think bette is if not the best  then tied with the best  she captures not just the bravura  but also the pathos of mama rose  i was never a natalie wood fan  so i really enjoyed cynthia gibb  in what is arguably her best role  everything from the costumes to the sets to the supporting performances is wonderful  the three strippers  led by the always dependable christine ebersole are hard to top  there was supposed to be a tv production of mame a few years back  with cher  but i think bette would be the best bet  pun intended  for auntie mame             i am sorry to say that this film is indeed bad  it reminds me of a c grade porn movie with one major difference  no porn  br    br   the story and dialogue needs a complete overhaul  maybe then the bad acting would not have been as noticeable  at the very least  the pacing should have been picked up  br    br   while i accept that this had a low budget and the director did a good job visually given what little resources he had  he should have spent more time on the story or better yet  get someone else to write it  many of the action scenes were just pointless  br    br   it was a complete waste of my time             is it a perfect movie  no  it is a weird adaptation from a sci fi book and it features vampires from space  naked beauties and the british army efficiency  br    br   when i first saw this movie i was rather young and all i can remember is the feeling of awe for the movie and mathilda may  actually  if it weren  t for this gorgeous lady being naked the whole movie  i probably wouldn  t have rated it so high  but given her sheer magnificence  i am now actually considering voting it up  br    br   lucky for me i got reminded of the movie and watched it again now  imagine raiders of the lost ark or poltergeist special effects splattered unto a rather decent sci fi story  but with completely over the top performances  i still enjoyed the movie tremendously  as well as mathilda may   but it was a mixture of nostalgia  comparing with the crap movies they make today and actually wanting more when it ended  br    br   bottom line  if you are a sci fi fan you are not allowed to miss this movie  oh  and did i mention mathilda may is young  beautiful and naked             overall i was rather impressed with the pilot  the initial first fifteen minutes were worrying  as it did feel the creators were trying to create a science fiction version of the o c but this fear is rectified when a terrorist incident occurs and from here the show steps into themes and situations that i very rarely see television tackle  br    br   bsg dealt with themes such as monotheism  existentialism  reality  death and terrorism but they were primarily subtext  there for the viewer to contemplate on or ignore if they so choose  here on the other hand these subjects are the focus of the show and i personally found myself evoking such works as ghost in the shell and the matrix as reference points while watching and being surprised by how well the themes were being discussed  i think if you are a fan of the two i just mentioned or other films television shows  which deal with the subjects i referenced  i think you will find at least something here  br    br   in terms of a starting point to explain how the situation we know in bsg came about i believe they handled it in a very interesting way  i especially liked how they explained where the cylon  s belief in one god came from and the creation of caprica had just enough advanced and contemporary technology thrown in to make it appear in the future but not completely alien to us as viewers  br    br   the only real weak points i noticed were the relationship between the greystone parents and the actress who plays   lacy rand    while i like eric stoltz and paula malcomson individually  together their scenes seemed to lack chemistry  at this point it could simply be down to developing their characters  but this is something i think needs work  i also found magda apanowicz to be unconvincing in her role  this again could be down to experience and time needed to develop  but throughout the episode her acting appeared forced and not completely confident  br    br   based on the pilot i greatly look forward to seeing where   caprica   goes in the future and hopefully it will touch the greatness that bsg once did             i  m the type of guy who loves hood movies from new jack city to baby boy to killa season  from the b grade to the hollywood  but this movie was something different  i am no hater and this movie was kinda enjoyable  but some bits were just weird  well the acting wasn  t to good  compared to silkk the shockers performance in hot boyz  quite good  and ice t in new jack and svu  great   the scene where corrupt  ice t  kills the wanna be jamaican dude he says something and lights himself on fire burning both ice t and the other dude  this kills the jamaican  however ice t is unharmed  very similar to ice  s other movie urban menace  which stars both of these actors  were snoops character is supernatural  however after this there is nothing suggested that corrupt is like a demon  when mj  silkk  gets stabbed at first he struggling but after that he fights normally and was stabbed in the thigh with out blood  and when mj confesses killing a cop cos the cop was beating up his friend benny was weird  benny isn  t introduced in this movie and the scene isn  t in the film  it does hold weight to the fact why corrupt wants to kill mj but is still makes u scratch your head  wen jody writes a letter to miss jones character explaining what happened to them afterwords doesn  t mention what happen   other main characters mj and lisa  the film did show the horror and poverty of the ghetto which plagues the lives of latinos and blacks word wide was a good part of the film  even though the clip of the projects was re used thousands of times  and the scene where miles kills the latino brother by crashing his bike at full speed  not wearing a helmet  and running into my latino brothers car would of killed him  the movie was similar to the film urban menace and half the actors were in both of these movies as well as the production team  it was ok tho  but me being from poverty i love hood films  however if u don  t love em like i do don  t watch it  only thing saving me from walking out is it reminded me of the first movie i made which was made with     dollars  and my love of the genre  br    br   nathaniel purez            i am a huge fan of the farcry game  huge fan  it still holds a place in my top    games list of all time  the story line was new  fresh    a truly brilliant foundation to base a movie on    or so i thought    br    br   farcry the movie is no less than another directors attempt at cashing in on a successful game franchise  see doom  the movie  and many more      br    br   the video game begins as the player  jack carver  awakes in a sea side cave after been shot off his boat by an rpg from an unknown soldier  jack then finds a communication device where  harlan doyle  guides him across islands  shipwrecks  jungles  installations and volcanoes  to find his  lady friend    valerie constantine   all the wile battling mutated super soldiers  and genetically enhanced animals  br    br   the movie plays out very  very differently     there  s a needless    mins      of the movie  of   backstory   before we even get to the   boat blowing up   scene     jack then walks onto the beach  kills some goons  then drives off    nothing like the game       there is no communicator with doyle on the other end       the   modified soldiers   look like albinos with singlets on    and there was no mutated   monkey like   creatures jumping out of the bushes  a part of the farcry game i enjoyed allot       there is no sun filled beach scenes  no aircraft carrier  no communications stations on huge cliffs  little reference to any in game contents  characters items vehicles   in fact no attempt to follow the story line at all     the climactic volcano scene from the game is replaced with an old industrial building     there  s an ending scene    where everyone  except krieger  live happily ever after    what the  br    br   i recommend avoiding this movie at all costs  if you are a gamer  you will hate this movie will all your soul  it is a movie clearly intended for males  so girls  stay away    so if your a male        years of age  have never played farcry  and are not disgusted by directors attempts at porting books games to the cinema    then this is for you               one of the best ensemble acted films i  ve ever seen  there isn  t much to the plot  but the acting  incredible  you see the characters change ever so subtly  undr the influence of the rented villa in italy  and love  and happiness  the film casts a mesmerizing spell on you  much as the villa does on all the women  truly   enchanted               i haven  t seen this movie in about   years  but it still haunts me   br    br   when asked about my favorite films  this is the one that i seem to always mention first  there are certain films  works of art like this film    dark city    and   breaking the waves    that seem to touch a place within you  a place so protected and hidden and yet so sensitive  that they make a lifelong impression on the viewer  not unlike a life changing event  such as the ending of a serious relationship or the death of a friend    this film   shook   me when i first saw it  it left me with an emotional hangover that lasted for several days             today  i wrote this review in anger at uwe boll and hollywood  br    br   hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation      changed everything  it changed our perception of security  it changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity  most importantly and devastatingly   it changed our world  br    br   however  i can  t not stress how utterly repulsed  disillusioned  and angry i am at the careless  blatant ignorance of hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction  this film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike  most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press  hollywood has sunk to a new low  even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty  behind it all is uwe boll  i am very angry at this movie  how dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost  how dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy      how dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post     world       how   dare   they   br    br   to those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty  i say this with a heavy heart with all my strength  remember  think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person  think back to that day  ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day  think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones  think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes  think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks  br    br   ask yourself if you have a soul  br    br   think  remember  respect the memories of the lives lost on     by not seeing this film at all             you cannot deny that we have an affinity for speed  that  s why movies like fast and the furious  dhoom  rempit get made to play to the satisfaction of audiences  especially local ones  we live on a tiny island  and i cannot fathom why  for the relative efficiency of the public transportation system  most of us want to get into debt by owning a set of wheels which come with      tax when they reach our shores  and the myriad of taxes and bills to pay when operating one  not only that  the high end sports cars were once quipped by a prominent politician up north that they will never reach fourth gear  lest they reach the sea  br    br   and these movies are relatively easy to make  hot wheels and hot chicks always go down well together in targeting the required demographic  for once  those plunging necklines exposing uncanny buxom and short skirts accentuating legs two meters long  can  t compete with the attention given to those beautiful curves that exotic cars possess in movies such as these  of course there are amongst us  ahem  those that go for the sexists portrayal of women as mere sexual objects  otherwise explain why motor shows come with truckloads of models  and movies such as these cannot do without a leggy model in a frame   however  they don  t warrant the kind of collective orgasmic sighs whenever the four wheelers come on screen  even when they do exactly nothing and have their gears into park  the guy sitting beside me  i swear he wet his pants every time his dream car s  appear  and creamed his pants even more when he hears those growling engine moans  br    br   so there we have it  the fan boys who turned up in droves just to watch which of the latest cool cars get featured in the movie  with the fast and the furious franchise  the japanese models like the evos and the skylines take centerstage  as does the gt  here  the ford gt takes on an incredibly drool worthy facade modification  that even i  m impressed  alongside the latest models like the ferrari enzos  porshe carerra gts  koenigsegg ccxs  and every car out there that has wings for doors  but seriously  my heart goes out to the cars each time they  re mercilessly wrecked just for entertainment  i mean  this are perfectly fine  high performance models that are at the apex of motoring  but yet because whoever financed the movie had millions to blow  they do so because they can  br    br   there  s no story in redline  just excuses to put together a movie full of beauties  the cars that is  that can rip down the tarmac in probably the most boring fashion possible  and with the usual shots of pedals  always the accelerator  mind you  tapping the brake pedal is tantamount to blasphemy  and earn you no respect   steering wheels  gear shifts  always shifting up and not down   all these while having the actors make pretend that they  re the baddest asses with an engine  snarling and giving each other dirty looks  not a very tall order for an actor  and that  s why we get the most woeful performances ever  with lines that seem to be written by elementary schoolkids  br    br   the heroine  yes  it made a statement that girls can drive  natasha  a very plasticky looking nadia bjorlin  is one of those million dollar finds   a girl with model looks who don  t mind getting down on fours and immersed in oil  who has racing pedigree within her  and performs with a rock band singing songs with lyrics that are just plain laughable  every line had to do with cars  and when singing about love  just had to string those innuendos like shifting gear shafts  lubricants and going for rides   introduced against her wishes to illegal racing by a gangsta called infamous  eddie griffin   she gets drawn into family squabbles involving a leo dicaprio lookalike iraq war veteran  and some sleazy lecherous looking rich uncle  everything else  well like i said  just serves as an excuse for the movie to go from race to race  br    br   and it  s almost always the same  as there  s very limited to what you can do to heighten tension between race cars  especially when you know the race is rigged  for narrative reasons  and can see the race outcome a mile away from the finishing line  while fast and furious had quite charismatic actors  and i will put my head on the chopping block by naming paul walker  sun kang  and of course  the star it created   vin diesel  redline had none  just pretty faces with lots of air unfortunately  it looks like a tv movie in its treatment from the get go  with a very insipid opening sequence where it  s one man  one car  and a     minutes race against time to get to vegas  br    br   if not for the cars  then this movie seriously is a piece of junk  with bad acting  bad lines and bad action  strictly for the car fans  or those who like their movies with countless of bevy beauties who pimp their bodies without any speaking lines             im the type of person who always goes   to horror section when i  m picking a film  so i picked five across the eyes  i was disgusted with this film and thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it it made my skin crawl to think that people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it it was low budget and very rubbish  i think i could of done better myself  i think that it was the worst film i have ever seen in my life and you should not bother to watch it the actors were rubbish the camera was awful the picture was bad and the sound was not up to scratch  i think it was a little bit like a cheep rip of off the baler which project and it has not worked at all it was foul             seven ups has been compared to bullitt for the chase scene  but does not come anywhere near matching bullitt  bullitt has a beginning that builds builds builds  when mcqueen leaves the seedy hotel  gets into his mustang  which is parked under the embarcadero freeway  now torn down  and notices the charger sitting nearbye  you know you are about to see something spectacular  from that moment on  when mcqueen starts that car  begins the best car chase sequence ever filmed  adding to it is a terrific lalo schriffin if i remember correctly sound track  this goes on for a long time before you actually hear the first tires squealing  that shot of mcqueen  s mustang suddenly appearing in bill hickman  s rear view mirror is unmatched for visual impact  hickman  s look of surprise and double take really adds to the effect  then of course  san francisco is unmatched for the setting of cars racing up and down hills and around bends  also  bullitt being filmed in the   s when cars were still   hot    mustang gt and dodge charger  made for a better set of wheels then two boring  smog device laden pontiacs in the     s seven ups  bill hickman was the driver of the bad guy car in both movies  i saw him sitting at an insider movie preview once on the univeral lot when i was doing movie reviews for a paper  they gave it a good try in seven ups though with the chase scene  seven ups had a few   jumps   over little hills   yawn  but of course they were not san francisco hills  the seven ups chase  where they are actually going fast  is longer than the go fast sequence in bullitt  but the scene of a single shotgun blast totally blowing the hood off of roy schieders pontiac is the height of absurdity  strictly hollywood  i would say  except that it was filmed in new york             have you ever heard the saying that people   telegraph their intentions    well in this movie  the characters   actions do more than telegraph future plans    they show up at your house drunk and buffet you about the head  this could be forgiven if the setting had been used better  or if the characters were more charismatic or nuanced  embeth davidtz  s character is not mysterious  just wooden  and kenneth branagh doesn  t succeed in conveying the brash charm his character probably was written to have  br    br   the bottom line  obvious plot  one note performances  unlikeable characters  and grotesque   southern   accents employed by british actors               night of the living homeless   was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season     obviously a parody of various zombie movies  most notably dawn of the dead  this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead  as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains  br    br   kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he  out of the goodness of his heart  gives a     to a homeless man in front of his house  more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park  until the town is completely overrun with them  this is a very strong randy marsh episode  as he assumes the role of the shotgun wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center  but before randy makes it to the community center  he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming   i don  t have any change     unfortunately  the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless  when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town  and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people  then he becomes one of them  asking everyone for change  br    br   the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park  and find a man who is a director of homeless studies  they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless  so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem  unfortunately  homeless people break into the man  s house  and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself  however  he fails several times  as he shoots himself in the jaw  in the eye  in the chest  in the neck  in the shoulder  screaming horribly until he finally dies  this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in   fantastic easter special   two weeks ago  br    br   meanwhile  a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem  the property values have nosedived  thus the bank has foreclosed on his house  making him homeless  randy immediately turns on him  holding the gun to the man  s head  when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out  randy pulls the trigger  br    br   in evergreen  the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park  and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country  the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica  california  br    br   the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re watchable                   br    br   i  m not sure who decides what category a movie fits into  but this movie is not a horror movie  as for the story  it was fairly interesting  but rather slow  i was especially disappointed with the ending though  br    br     spoiler   br    br   tell me why on earth does she run over to her uncle  s    home without at least calling the detective or the police first  she knows exactly what  s going on at that point  plus she has a video tape as proof  instead  she runs over there and starts going nuts and saying   i know everything  i have proof  you didn  t expect proof  did you     then she acts surprised when her uncle stands up and starts walking over to her as if he  s going to harm her  well duh  of course he  s going to harm you idiot  you just told him you know everything and have proof to expose everything  what a dumb ending            i gave this a    there are so many plot twists that you can never be sure to root for  total mayhem  everyone gets killed or nearly so  i am tired of cross hairs and changing views  i cannot give the plot away  convoluted and insane  if i had paid to see this i would demand my money back  i wish reviews were more honest           not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is paula sage s touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline  this gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think you ve seen something special                  i read the book before seeing the movie  and the film is one of the best adaptations out there  very true and faithful to the book  sean penn and sarandon are amazing  robbins is a talented filmaker and i wish he would add more to his repetoire  he made the film very haunting and intentionally slow paced to add depth  an especially brilliant bit of filmaking was the reflection of the victims appearing in the glass of the execution room at the very end             docteur petiot  starring michel serrault  is a brutal story about a brutal man  a doctor who heals the sick in occupied france  even if their ability to compensate is not there  yet  he preys on the weakest amidst the populace  the imagery and cinematography are superb  and lend an additional macabre feeling to this complex story  he is the perfect psychopath  seductive and altruistic  intelligent and caring  calculating and murderous  a movie certain not to be forgotten soon by the viewer  kudos to mr  serrault  for his chilling portrayal             i just got this video used and i was watching it last night  the acting started out extremely bad  hey      hey      twister  but got very good soon after wards  the tornadoes looked extremely fake  and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy  but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done  and just about on par with movies like twister  the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too  the story was very well written  and it  s refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old   disaster formulas   movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for    years  br    br   while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality  this merits an a in my book             this film is really vile  it plays on the urban paranoia of the   s   s and puts it into a school context  i  m not saying that urban crime wasn  t a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren  t aren  t problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit  violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it  s not a case of social issues but a white  upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol  and of course he knows how to play the system  does that sound familiar  yes  this turd is pure violent exploitation  a really nasty piece of work  it  s disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment  this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator  death wish     and so on and so on  the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this             what a horrible  horrible film  the worst collection of cliches i have seen in a long time  not that i saw much  i left the theatre screaming after about    minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves  meryl streep was awful as usual  how many hurt and tortured expressions can   person have  aidan quinn  s talents were   as so often   totally wasted  and who told gloria estefan she could act  trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes   brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school   the kids weren  t even cute  just written in to suit the appalling script  aaargh  wes craven really made me cringe for once  real horror this one             motocrossed was fun  but it wasn  t that great  i guess i just didn  t understand a lot of the motocross racing   lingo    and there was a lot of that in the film   the plot wasn  t what i expected from the disney channel previews  so that could account for some of my disappointment             sixth escapade for freddy krueger in which he has finally managed to kill off virtually every youth in springwood  now he wants to broaden his horizons and    spoiler    needs a family member in order to do it  br    br   a failure as a horror movie because it simply ain  t scary at all  works better as a dark  macabre black comedy  to tell you the truth  freddy krueger has now been stripped of all of his ability to chill this viewer   too many wisecracks  that  s for sure   the actors aren  t interesting  save robert englund  as always  and an obviously slumming yaphet kotto  and there are simply far too many visual effects  the finale is ok but doesn  t provide as many sparks as i think one might hope  br    br   in adding a new twist to the familiar dream killer  s story  it provides englund the opportunity to do more non makeup scenes than ever before  br    br   there are cameos worth noting  a joint cameo by then couple roseanne and tom arnold that is devoid of entertainment value  an appropriate appearance by veteran shock rocker alice cooper  and a funny cameo by johnny depp that also sort of acknowledges the pop icon that he had become  br    br   film debut of breckin meyer  who plays spencer  br    br   one of the best things about it is the replaying of key scenes from earlier entries during the closing credits  br    br                   ok  i  m italian but there aren  t so many italian film like this  i think that the plot is very good for     of the film but the final is too simple  too predictable  but it  s the only little mistake  the consequences of love in my opinion have great sequences in particular at the beginning and great soundtrack  i  d like very much the lighting work on it  the best thing on it is a great  great actor  you know  if your name were al pacino now everybody would have still been talking about this performance  but it  s only a great theater italian actor called toni servillo  yes  someone tell me this film and this kind of performance it  s too slow  it  s so boring  so many silences  but i think that this components its fantastic  its the right way for describing the love story between a very talented young girl  the grand daughter of the italian actress anna magnani  olivia and the old mysterious man toni  one of my favorite italian films             if you only see one ernest movie in your life  make it this one  this is by far the best in the series  with its nonstop laughs and clever humor that is suitable for all ages  the other   ernest   flicks were good too  but most people tend to get tired of him quickly  not me  however    br    br   in this movie  ernest p  whorrel is assigned jury duty for a murder case  the murderer  nash  just happens to look exactly like our bumbling hero ernest  mr  nash finds this a good opportunity to escape from jail by knocking him out switching identities with him  and so we get to see how ernest reacts in the slammer  br    br   a great flick  if you haven  t already seen it  watch it             an idiotic dentist finds out that his wife has been unfaithful  so  no new story lines here  however  the authors managed to create a stupid  disgusting film  if you enjoy watching kids vomiting  or seeing a dentist imagining that he is pulling all his wife  s teeth out in a bloody horror type  go see  or rent  the film  if not  move on to something else  my fair lady  anyone              the first cube movie was an art movie  it set up a world in which all the major archetypes of mankind were represented  and showed how they struggled to make sense of a hostile world that they couldn  t understand  it was  on the non literal level  a   man vs  cruel nature   plot  where the individual who represented innocence and goodness came through in the end  triumphing to face a new  indefinable world beyond man  s petty squabbles  a world where there were no more struggle  but peace  i rated cube a    out of     and it  s a movie that was never meant to have any sequels  br    br   the second movie  hypercube was a massive disappointment  some of the ideas were kind of cool  but in the context of the original movie  both the story and the setting made no sense and had no meaning  still  for being fairly entertaining  i rated it a   out of     br    br   the third movie  cube zero  while ignoring the second  plays like a vastly inferior commercial b movie rehash of the first  sans the symbolism  there is no   homage   or   tribute   here  there is only ripping off  the same kind of plot  with some elements idiotically altered  like having letters instead of prime numbers between the cubes   an idea which shows more clearly than anything else that this is a rip off with absolutely no originality and nothing to say   br    br   that we see something from   behind the scenes   means nothing  because the watchers are just part of the big bad experiment  the architects of which we hear nothing of  and  in this movie  those who get through to the exit  like kazan did at the end of the first movie  are just killed   where the  bleep  is the sense in that   that  s just flippin   stupid  i  m glad i didn  t pay to see this  br    br   the production values and acting in cube zero are not too bad  but the story and the ideas are so utterly devoid of any inspiration that this movie can only get from me a rating of   out of                i have just watched this movie on dvd late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience  in other words   the creators planed to make comedy not drama  howsoever  at the end i realized that mr  tony giglio was earnest about this movie  it  s a pity because  the dialogue is ridiculous  the acting is poor and lifeless  the story is a fishy tale  poor ryan phillippe   despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance  what to say for jason statham   lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction    for this reasons i vote                  i believe shakespeare explained what i just read beautifully  me thinks he  the lady  doth protest too much  the whole thing sounded to me as if the author was trying to convince himself  he sites profane literature  writings from the same time period but not connected with the bible  a number of times however i can think of at least three references off the top of my head which lend historical accuracy to events contained in the bible  anyone can skew data   prove anything they like but it doesn  t make it true  customs change  word definitions change over time  look at english   german where it is very obviously a common root  nothing stays the same  it  s always growing and changing  the bible has many different translations but the king james version is the one i  ve found to be the best when it comes to any kind of research  in the king james version you will notice there are certain words written in italics  these words have been added by the translators and can be dropped   the mean of the entire verse changes  writings from around the time of christ were written without spaces  without punctuation  without paragraphs   without numeric verses  these writings look like one long word   the translators added all of the above  for example how would you read this  godisnowhere do you read it as god is nowhere or do you read it as god is now here  same string of letters two entirely different meanings  this is why many biblical researchers use a   lexicon   to assist them in translation as it provides a word for word translation from the original arabic  greek or hebrew depending on the language in which the scripture was originally written  it  s also interesting to note that when translated into symbolic logic you can prove god exists but you can not prove he doesn  t exist  in the end i just love listening to people who think they are so smart that they are qualified to judge the almighty  talk about ego  putting soapbox away  god bless maegi              i presume you are here for damage to your mental circuitry      val br    br   mike nelson made me watch this   he mentioned it in his book    movie megacheese    i asked myself    why would mike nelson steer me wrong    i now know why the bots never trusted mike nelson  br    br   the music is by john williams  which is probably part of his payment to the devil  in fact  i  m sure anyone who worked on this movie is probably in league with ol   slewfoot  or is now cursed  from the executive director down to the guy who ran the catering truck outside the studio  don  t watch   for the love of god   don  t watch    not even making a copy and showing someone else will un curse you   i  m doomed now  i understand this  i accept this  but save yourself               this movie was flippin awful    i wanted those hours of my life back  for god  s sake   stay far away from this awful crumb ball movie at all costs  its not worth mentioning the title  but the ratings on this movie are pretty generous for a vomit scum movie like this  and where do i begin  the dumb a   kids in the movie     the zero plot or story    the garden variety college frat boy esquire scenes of towel slapping  or the very bad acted  teen angst innuendo           my god  it never ended      i remember thinking i would have rather kissed the movie theater floor  then sit through this one again  br    br   but what do you expect  most people with the brain power to look up reviews  are not going to be the target audience here at all  so go see pirites   again  or the jet lee one   if your debating to yourself  look  this movie will just cost you your soul  your money  your energy  and your brain cells  heed the warning             this is a movie that i can watch over and over and never ever get tired of it  it has lot  s of laughs  guns  action  crime   good one liners  and a decent plot  with an over the top  donald sutherland in a rather comedic role as an assasain  tia carerra looks as hot as she ever did and can act too  thomas ian griffin is great in this as the lead character   max   a dea agent diane is the fbi agent  played by carerra  and john lithgow from frazier on tv  plays the bad guy     livingston    the plot centers around max and diane trying to capture livingston while they fight and argue with each other about who gets the money for the respective agencies  throw into the mix the assassain sutherland  who pretty much has all the good one liners  this is the perfect crime caper  there is the usual love story   but played very differently than you would think by carerra and griffith  you also have the russian mafia  italian mafia  and chineese mafia here thrown into the mix   the film is shot in boston   where you have some great shots   and locals   great photography and music in this film  this movie is just the epitome of a crime comedy   it has everything that one could ever want  check out sutherland  s toilet in a particular scene   very unusual  this film is a riot and will make you laugh real hard    plus for me             if you like to see animals being skinned alive  their heads smashed  dogs throats being crushed my men stomping on them  then this one is for you  but if you are somewhat normal  and don  t need to see real footage of animal cruelty  pass this one up  this movie tries to shock the viewer  and it sure does with the animal snuff at the beginning  and the killing of babies in the movie  fake at least its was enough to make myself turn it off i  ve seen movies like this before that show slaughterhouse footage  btk movie  and this kind of footage should not be allowed in a horror movie we watch gore and horror because we know its just make up  and special effects  so we shouldn  t sit down to watch a movie and see the real killing of animals  its not what we rented the movie for if anything  there should be a large warning label put on these types of garbage movies so people won t be surprised by it  as a very hardcore horror fan  this one turned my stomach  the entire movie cast and crew need their heads checked             another spanish movie about the      civil war  this time we  re told about the story of carol  lovely played by d  butant clara lago   a little girl which comes to live to a little spanish village from new york  it is such an initiating trip  and soon she  ll find about the injustices of the human race  their stupid fights and conflicts  their contradictions  br    br   imanol uribe makes his best film since   d  xadas contados          with such a sober pulse  a beautiful photography  and a nice script  he tries not to take part in the conflict  he just shows us some facts and let us decide  ok  the facts are explicit enough to make us decide in which band are we in  and he takes a huge advantage of the presence and the freshness of the young starring couple  clara lago and juan jos   ballesta  br    br   a well cared production  br    br   my rate                  a response to previous comments made by residents of the region where this motion picture was lensed  one person suggested that the closing and destruction of the ocean view amusement park led to a downturn in the surrounding neighborhoods  this is simply not true  prior to the construction of interstate     which bypasses the ocean view area  the primary route for traffic went through the heart of ocean view  once the interstate was completed  ocean view rapidly became a ghost town with businesses closing up and an increase in crime  this led to a huge reduction in revenues for the park  which also faced new competition from nearby busch gardens in williamsburg  meanwhile  in the past few years  the city of norfolk has done a remarkable job of fostering redevelopment so that the area has become a sought after location for construction of high end housing  br    br   it has also been said that the destruction footage of the roller coaster was used in the film   rollercoaster    this is also untrue  footage was shot of two coaster cars careening off the ride for that film  but the actual explosions and collapse are exclusive to   death of ocean view park    br    br   as to the film itself  the storyline of a   supernatural   force in the water adjacent to the park was certainly silly  but somewhat typical for b grade movies of the time  with the cast involved  there should be no surprise that the scenery was gnawed in almost every scene by the primary actors  i don  t believe this film was intended to be another   citizen kane    i believe playboy was experimenting with a new non nude format to determine if this was an area for the company to expand into  apparently not    a strange force in the water causing strange events in an old amusement park probably sounded good at the conference table  but proved unmanageable in execution  the roller coaster and the rest of the park was destined for the wrecking ball anyway    let  s come up with a weird way to justify an explosive demise     br    br   for the casual movie viewer  this would be a   see once and forget about it   film  except for diana canova fans   but for the thousands of people who live in the region and have fond memories of the park  this movie is like a   walk down memory lane   for footage of the park as well as old footage of downtown norfolk  the first   harborfest    and old dominion university  even a limited release of this film on dvd would be welcome             i was expecting a lot from mr amitabh bachan  s role of sarkar  but am disappointed  being a ram gopal verma  s direction i was not ready for this kind of a movie  sarkar is supposed to be a strong character  but the movie shows that amitabh is too dependent on others power rather than his  there is a movie in tamil called nayakan based on the theme of god father and kamala hassan has played the lead  the movie is well directed and the power till the end remains in the hands of kamala hassan  not his son  amitabh bachan seems to be too helpless in the movie and he just accepts everything instead of changing things  the movie fails to show the strong impact of god father             a trio of buddies  sergeants all in the british army  carouse   brawl their way across imperial india  intensely loyal to each other  they meet their greatest   most deadly challenge when they encounter the resurgence of a hideous cult   its demented  implacable guru  now they must rely on the lowliest servant of the regiment  the water carrier gunga din  to save scores of the queen  s soldiers from certain massacre  br    br   based more on the three musketeers than kipling  s classic poem  this is a wonderful adventure epic   a worthy entry in hollywood  s golden year of       filled with suspense   humor  while keeping the romantic interludes to the barest minimum  it grips the interest of the viewer and holds it right up to the  sentimental  conclusion  br    br   it is practically fruitless to discuss the performance nuances of the three stars  cary grant  victor mclaglen   douglas fairbanks jr   as they are really all thirds of a single organism   inseparable and  to all intents   purposes  indistinguishable  however  this diminishes nothing of the great fun in simply watching them have a glorious time  br    br    it  s interesting to note  parenthetically  that mclaglen boasted of a distinguished world war one military career  fairbanks would have a sterling record in world war two   mostly in clandestine affairs   earning himself no fewer than   honorary knighthoods after the conflict  while grant reportedly worked undercover for british intelligence  keeping an eye on hollywood nazi sympathizers   br    br   the real acting laurels here should go to sam jaffe  heartbreaking in the title role  he infuses the humble man with radiant dignity   enormous courage  making the last line of kipling  s poem ring true  he is unforgettable  br    br   montague love is properly stalwart as the regimental major  whilst eduardo ciannelli is evil incarnate as the thuggee guru  the rest of the cast  joan fontaine  robert coote  lumsden hare  are effective but have little to do  movie mavens will recognize cecil kellaway in the tiny role of miss fontaine  s father  br    br   the film picks its villains well  the demonic thuggee cult  worshipers of the hideous  blood soaked kali  hindu goddess of destruction  was the bane of indian life for   centuries  ritualistically strangling up to        victims a year  in      the british military  in cooperation with a number of princely states  succeeded in ultimately suppressing the religion  henceforth it would remain the stuff of novels   nightmares             this movie pretty much sucked  i  m in the army and the soldiers depicted in this movie are horrible  if your in the military and you see this movie you  ll laugh and be upset the entire movie because of the way they acted as a squad  it was ridiculous  they acted like a bunch of normal people with army uniforms on not knowing what to do  it was a pretty gory movie i  d have to say the least  there was a couple scenes where they try to make you jump  i  d recommend seeing it if you are bored and want to see a violent  gory movie  it will be a better movie also if your not in the military  i also would have to say i liked the first one better than this one            if you watched pulp fiction don t see this movie  this movie is not funny  this is the worst parody movie ever  this is a poor attempt of parody films  br    br   the cast is bad  the film is bad  this is one of the worst pictures ever made  br    br   i do not recommend plump fiction  i prefer the original pulp fiction by the great quentin tarantino  this is one of the worst parody films ever made  br    br   plump fiction is not a good movie  it is not funny  it is so dumb and vulgar            i went to see   passion of mind   because i usually get a kick out of the genre of alternate reality romances  i e    sliding doors      me  myself  i    etc   br    br   but this was the worst one i  ve ever seen  i had to force myself to sit through it  i didn  t even stay through the credits which is unheard of for me  br    br   the magical realism was completely missing because demi moore was grim and the lovers she was two timing were guys who usually play villains  though each was kind of sexy and appealing  br    br   there was actually a psychological explanation provided for the dual lives  with a distasteful frisson of the elektra complex  maybe the magic shouldn  t be explained for this genre to work  br    br    originally written                       i thought that rotj was clearly the best out of the three star wars movies  i find it surprising that rotj is considered the weakest installment in the trilogy by many who have voted  to me it seemed like rotj was the best because it had the most profound plot  the most suspense  surprises  most emotional  especially the ending  and definitely the most episodic movie  i personally like the empire strikes back a lot also but i think it is slightly less good than than rotj since it was slower moving  was not as episodic  and i just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as i did with the third movie  br    br   it also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for rotj being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole  i have heard many strange reasons such as  a  because yoda died b  because bobba fett died c  because small ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d  because darth vader was revealed br    br   i would like to debunk each of these reasons because i believe that they miss the point completely  first off  who cares if bobba fett died    if george lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die  don  t get me wrong i am fan of bobba fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not lucas   intention to make him a central character in the films that star wars fans made him out to be  his name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie    you had to go to the credits to find out bobba fett  s name    judging rotj because a minor character died is a bit much i think    secondly  many fans did not like yoda dying  sure  it was a momentous period in the movie  i was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic  all the good guys can  t stay alive in a realistic movie  you know  otherwise if all the good guys lived and all the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy saturday morning cartoon  another aspect to this point about people not liking yoda  s death   well  nobody complained when darth vader struck down obi wan kenobi in a new hope   many consider a new hope to be the best of the trilogy  why was obi wan  s death okay but yoda  s not    hmmmmmmmmmmmm     another reason i just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible  that is utterly ridiculous   i can not believe this one   first off  the ewoks are in their native planet endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there  if you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage   since you lived in the forest all your life i hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage  they had swinging vines  ropes  logs set up to trip those walkers  and other traps  the stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest  the only thing they had was their blasters  to add  it was not like the ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves  they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest  i thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the star wars heros  the band of rebels  as well as the huge clan of ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain  that would have been a great upset  lastly  if this scene was still unbelievable to you   how about in empire strikes back or in a new hope where there were several scenes of a group consisting of just han solo  chewbacca  and the princess  being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view   and not only that  the heroes   of course  always hit the stormtroopers with their blasters  the troopers must have very  very bad aim then  at least in empire strikes back  the battle of endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not   heroes against a legion of stormtroopers  don  t believe me  check out the battle at cloud city when our heroes were escaping lando  s base  or when our heros were rescuing princess leia and being shot at  somehow they missed as han solo and luke were trying to exit the death star  br    br   the last reason that i care to discuss  others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here   is that people did not like darth vader being revealed  well  in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie  luke was trying to find whether or not darth vader was his father  annakin skywalker  it would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without luke getting to see his father  s face because it made it complete  by annakin  s revelation it symbolized the transition darth vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side  in his helmet  and to the good person he was annakin skywalker  by removing the helmet   the point is that annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about  in fact  that  s is what i would have done in that scene too if i were luke  s father   isn  t that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmet  br    br   on another note  i think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel must be worse  even if it is better  that preceding movies is another reason that rotj does not get as many accolades as it deserves  i never go into a film with that deception in mind  i always try to go into a film with the attitude that   well  it might be better or worse that the original    but i can not know for sure   let  s see    that way i go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really was  br    br   i am not sure who criticizes these movies but  i have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite star wars movie and they all tell me  except for one person that said that a new hope was their favorite  that it is rotj  i believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleading  br    br   bottom line  the return of the jedi was the best of the trilogy  this movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its     minutes  there was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful  exciting  surprising  or all of the above  for example  the emotional light saber battle between luke and his father in rotj was better than the one in the empire strikes back any day    br    br   finally  i hope people go see the phantom menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky  insignificant details  or see it as   just another sequel    to trash the movie such as   this movie stinks because luke is not in it    then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like rotj suffered unfortunately  br    br               crossfire remains one of the best hollywood message movies because  unlike the admirably intentioned gentleman  s agreement  which it beat to theatres by a few months  it chooses to send its message via the form an excellent noir thriller rather than have an outraged star constantly saying   it  s because i  m jewish  isn  t it    it  s much easier to get the message that hate is like a loaded gun across when the dead bodies are actual rather than metaphorical  somewhat shamefully  the brief featurette on the warners   dvd doesn  t mention that novelist richard brooks disowned the film over the shift from a homophobic murder to an anti semitic one  but it  s interesting to note that while the victim is killed primarily because he is jewish  there  s little doubt in sam levene  s performance that the character is in fact also gay    not a mincing caricature  but there  s definitely a two lost souls aspect to his scenes with george cooper  s confused soldier  there  s not much of a mystery to who the murderer is  even though the killing is carried out in classic noir shadows  the body language of the killer is instantly recognisable  but then the film has its characters drift to the same conclusion before the halfway point  the tension comes from proving it and saving the fall guy  br    br   there  s an element of ealing films to the gang of soldiers teaming together to get their buddy out of a fix  you could almost see that aspect as a blueprint for hue and cry   but the atmosphere is pure rko noir  set over one long sweltering night  the film has a great look filled with deep dark blacks and shadows born as much out of economy as style  it cut back on lighting time and allowed director edward dmytryk more time to work with the actors  and the excellent cast make the most of the fine script  a laid back but quietly charismatic robert mitchum  robert young  s maigret like detective  gloria grahame  s tramp and the perpetually creepy paul kelly as her compulsive liar admirer  a guy who tries on stories the way other people try on ties  but the lasting impression is of robert ryan  s excellent performance as a guy who could do with a good leaving alone as he does his best to help the wrongly accused man all the way to death row  a big surprise hit in       as a reward  dmytryk and producer adrian scott found themselves investigated by the huac  which itself had a notable tendency to target jews  so much for crusading              this movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved  it  s always interesting to see the story from the   other   side for a change  this movie concentrates on a group of german soldiers who after fighting in the north africa campaign are send to stalingrad  russia  where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of ww ii is being fought  br    br   it  s interesting to see the other side of this battle  since we mainly just always see the germans simply as the   villains    in this movie those   villains   are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy in war is war itself and not necessarily those who you  re fighting against  at first it  s kind of hard to concentrate on the movie because you always just have in the back of your mind that the german  s are the evil villains  but of course you get accustomed to it quickly and you soon adapt the germans as the main characters of the movie and you even start to care  and be interested in them  br    br   the way this story is told isn  t however the best  it  s hard to keep track of the story at times  as it jumps from the one sequence and location to the other  the movie isn  t always logic in its storytelling and features a bit too many sequences that remain too vague  it also is most of the time pretty hard to keep the characters apart and see who is who  it doesn  t always makes this movie an easy on to watch but than again on the other hand  there are plenty enough sequences and moments present in this movie to make it worthwhile and an interesting one  just not the most coherent one around  in that regard hollywood movies are always better than european movies  br    br   the production values are high and features some good looking sets and locations  though the movie wasn  t even shot in russia itself  it helps to create a good war time situation atmosphere  br    br   the character are mostly interesting although perhaps a tad bit formulaic  but i don  t know  for some reason formulaic characters always work out fine in war movies and strenghtens the drama and realism  it also helps that they  re being played by well cast actors  all of the actors aren  t the best known actors around  thomas kretschmann was also at the time still a fairly unknown actor  but each of them fit their role well and gives its characters an unique face and personality  br    br   all in all not the best or most consistent ww ii drama around but definitely worth a look  due to its original approach of the german side of the battle of stalingrad and its good production values  br    br                   so i rented this from netflix because somebody gave me roger ebert  s book   i hated  hated  hated this movie   and he gave this one a rare zero star rating in the book and said at the end of his original review   mad dog time should be cut up to provide free ukulele picks for the poor    so i figured from ebert saying that i would see if it was really as bad as he said it was  i know most society says not to listen to critics and to judge for yourself but i could not express how much i hated this piece of junk like ebert did and never since ebert  s review of rob reiner  s   north   where he said he hated that movie ten times had i ever heard such a brilliant hatred movie review  here we have richard dreyfuss as a gangster which i don  t think it would be terrible to see dreyfuss as a gangster if the screenplay for this movie were written well  but above all the other things that were awful about this   movie   i can certainly tell you the script was not written well at all  while the movie starts off with jeff goldblum saying that he enjoyed watching dreyfuss  s girlfriend while dreyfuss was at a criminal hospital the movie starts off with some decent dialog after the opening credits  but after that first   or   minutes the other    minutes just consists of dumb characters talking pointless garbage for    seconds then someone gets shot  then there are a whole bunch of jokes about dreyfuss being mentally ill  haha  not funny  then we get an unpleasant and unfunny scene parodying frank sinatra  s   my way   sang by gabriel byrne apparently to insult dreyfuss  of course because the screenplay was written on the level of a sixth grader dreyfuss shoots byrne over five times and byrne just will not die  are we as the audience supposed to even care or find that mildly funny  i can certainly tell you i did not care or find that funny  not only am i disappointed in dreyfuss  who i admire much as an actor  for producing and starring in this tripe but i am also extremely disappointed in jeff goldblum because this was released the same year that   independence day   was the top grossing film of the year and ultimately one of the most successful films in history  did goldblum feel that   independence day   would be a flop and then just take the next role that was offered to him to make some money if   independence day   were a bomb  what did an oscar winner and the star of two of the biggest money making films in history find remotely enjoyable about this  the opening sequence of   mad dog time   says that the movie is set on another planet  i only wish now that i have wasted    minutes watching this trash that it would have stayed and opened in theaters on the planet where it supposedly takes place so that way everyone on this planet would never here of this ridiculous waste of    minutes out of my life that i will never get back  ebert saying the movie should have been cut up is not good enough i am afraid  every copy of   mad dog time   should have gasoline poured all over it and be lit on fire  i have yet to top a worst movie i have ever seen because this one has won it  s honor as the worst movie ever             what a boring film  to sum it all up  its was basically just nana patekar beating up his daughter in law karisma kapoor  while she tried to flee from the village  with her son  can someone say boring    the concept wasn  t too bad  but it was poorly executed  the canadian locales  and some of the village scenes were nicely shot  however  overall the cinematography came up short  the story could have been great  but the movie just seemed to drag on  there is only so much stupidity a person can take  let alone three bloody hours of it  br    br   the best part of the whole movie was the song   ishq kamina    and that was only five minutes long  other than that  this movie was a piece of crap              rant start  i didn  t want to believe them at first  but i guess this is what people are talking about when they say south korean cinema has peaked and may even be going downhill  after the surprisingly fun and moving monster movie   gwoemul    aka   the host    of        which actually succeeded in making a sharp satire out of a b movie genre   successive korean blockbusters have become more and more generic  even though their budgets  mainly spent on special effects  have become more and more fantastic  do south korean movie makers really want to squander all the audience and investor goodwill  which their industry has built up since the      break out film   shiri swiri    by making a whole series of big budget mediocre movies like mainland china did   rant end  br    br   the only   reason   i can fathom for making this movie is to dupe the investors into financing the most detailed and fluid digital animation of a korean  east asian styled dragon i have seen to date  for the final scenes  now if they had introduced that dragon at the beginning and given it more personality and purpose like in the        dragonheart    the movie might have had a few more redeeming qualities other than having lots of digitally animated dragons  remember   dungeons   dragons   in       hasn  t anyone learnt that the trick is not how much special effects you use  but how well you use it  i hope there are more  and better  korean legends they can use  because they have just killed a lot of international interest in korean dragon legends with the way they filmed this one  br    br   in short  i agree with all the negative reviews gone before and wonder how koreans felt about having their folk anthem   arirang   being played at the very end  as a creature feature  i would have given it at least   stars out of    if the special effects or action sequences had been worth it  but i  ve seen many video games with better camera work and scripting  just less dragons              as a native chinese  i can not accept this kind of idea that some people must die for a   better world    i said   better world   because it is a lie that chinese people have been indoctrinated for thousand years   br    br   i guess most western audience may don  t know qin shihuang means the first emperor   the king in this film is the most notorious tyrant in ancient china  the tianxia chinese word was spoken by the king  means   the land and the people    spoken from his mouth is totally lie  from then on  one after another  all the king in ancient china spoke the same thing but very few of them did as what they said  br    br   another fact is  qin shihuang  s empire only lasted about twenty years before it was destroyed by people  br    br   well  i do like the beautiful scenes of this movie  but it can not make me accept the idea that people should die for a tyrant             this had a great cast with big name stars like tyrone power  henry fonda  randolph scott  nancy kelly  henry hull and brian donlevey and a bunch more lesser but known names with shorter roles  it also had technicolor  one of the few movies made with it in       br    br   now the bad news       regrettably  i can  t say much positive for the story  it portrayed the james boys in a totally positive light    and hollywood has done that ever since  why these criminals are always shown to be the   good guys   is beyond me  this film glamorizes them and made their enemies   the railroad people   into vicious human beings  the latter was exaggerated so much it was preposterous  well  that  s the film world for you  evil is good  good is bad  br    br   hey hollywood  here  s a news flash   the james boys were criminals  really   look it up             i remember watching this series avidly  every saturday evening  it was the highlight of the week  i loved everything about it  the location  the costumes  the actors and the wonderful music by clannad  i still have their legend album   i loved the way they solved the problem of michael praed leaving by creating another robin  this time the earl of huntingdon  i believe there were legends of several robins in medieval times  another thing i loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors  i  m sure robin and his men would have young  after all people didn  t live that long in those days  other robins always look too old  kevin costner with his ridiculous accent looked like robin  s granddad   the only sad thing was the ending  it  s a shame they couldn  t at least have done a one off special to tie up all the loose ends and give it a happier ending             i don  t normally write reviews  but this   film   was special  i couldn  t turn it off  i don  t believe i  ve ever seen a worse movie  but there i sat  watching  it was like a horrible car wreck with blood flowing all over the highway  it was disgusting  but i couldn  t turn away  where do i start  the movie seems to think it  s a sports thriller  but it  s so utterly ridiculous  it can only be a comedy  but it  s not funny  not even in a dumb silly way  it  s like watching your cousins try to act out a skit on family get togethers  it  s painful to watch  but at least it  s only for a minute or two  second string went on for over an hour   br    br   whoever was involved with making this movie should not work again  the writing  directing  acting  and everything was just terrible  the problem is i can  t describe how bad it was  you just had to see it  and i  m sure this will never be shown again  so unless you saw it  you  re out of luck  i mean it was almost worth seeing just for the fact that it gave me some appreciation for every other   bad   film i  ve seen over my lifetime  and for every film i see in the future that i can  t stand  i will think to myself  well  at least it wasn  t bad as the second string             few would argue that master animation director hayao miyazaki is one of the few to hold this ability  br    br    no  too many are focused on john lassiter  s   amazing   ability to steal other movies plots  turn them into pretty puppet shows and then be lauded as a genius       but i digress   br    br   miyazaki has given us film after film that deals with important mature issues  usually ecologically themed   and has an intelligent script that even the most jaded viewer who would normally despise any film that was animated could thoroughly enjoy if given the chance  still  miyazaki  almost  never forgets who will undoubtedly be in the audience of these movies  children  br    br   that said  i am at a loss to think of another filmmaker with this ability  where else are you going to have a film where a three year old  my nephew link  will sit still throughout the move  enthralled  a   year old  my niece amber  loving it all her own  and able to appreciate the   star power   of frankie jonas and noah cyrus  a    year old  my nephew aaron  who  s review was   of course it was good  everything miyazaki san does is good     a    year old animation fan brought to tears by the powerful directing and gorgeous animation  er  that would be me   and a    year old woman  my mother  able to connect with the mother characters  and i  m betting the older charas too  and loving the   cuteness   of the child characters  br    br   and that is what i respect most about miyazaki san  he seems to speak to his audience in a completely different way than the average filmmaker  on the surface    ponyo   could be seen as a simple story about a little fish girl who gets a taste of the human world and wants to join it and the friend she makes there  a little boy names soske  somewhat like   the little mermaid     but there is an entire different level at play here  true to form  miyazaki populates his film with intensely strong female characters ponyo  s mother  soske  s mother  the older ladies in a nursing home are all genuine characters with minds of their own and extremely strong willed  br    br   but the girl who takes the cake is ponyo herself  once she decides that she likes the human world  she simply uses her own will to achieve her dreams  her father is trying to keep her innocent  and keep her a magical fish  but young ponyo knows what she wants and becomes human out of simply her own determination   br    br   once human  she teams up with her friend  soske  whom she loves very much  although maybe not as much as ham   soske is asked to be the man of the house  at age five  when his mother lisa decides she has to help the people at the rest home where she works during a typhoon that has been inadvertently caused by ponyo on her quest to become human  frankie jonas  yes  he  s related to the jonas brothers  can we just get past that please   gives  perhaps  the best performance in the film as young soske  which is good since he has the most lines   his character is also strong willed  but also very respectful and friendly  characteristics you  re not likely to find in a child character on this side of the pacific  br    br   in the end  ponyo  s father  fujimoto must cope with his daughter  s decision and his estranges wife  s wishes to allow her to be human  he hopes that ponyo and soske will   remember him fondly    and once again  miyazaki refuses to allow a character to become the stereotypical   bad guy    although miyazaki has  for some reason  received some criticism for this  it is  honestly  what makes his movies magical and yet relatable  no one in real life is completely a   bad person    all humans are various shades of gray  and that is exactly what miyazaki does with his characters   br    br   and then there  s the animation itself  in a time when cgi would certainly have helped with the copious amounts of effects shots in this film  especially the water  miyazaki has chosen to incorporate no cgi whatsoever  certainly the hand drawn animation was colored by digital means  but every film in this was hand drawn and i  for one  was extremely grateful for that  the character animation was extremely fluid  and there even appeared to be some lip sync going on  quite unusual for an anime film   the backgrounds seemed to be rendered with colored pencil and had an effect all its own on the audience  this is what animation used to look like  and what it should look like   br    br   in the end  i found ponyo to be thoroughly enjoyable  certainly not miyazaki  s best  in my opinion  that honor is still held by kiki  s delivery service   but still a    star fun movie for the entire family             attractive marjorie farrah fawcett lives in fear after being accosted by a lone biker  she is mortally shaken with the fact her attacker knows her address  as expected  joe james russo   the attacker forces his way into marjorie  s home and subjects her to humiliating terror  bruised and bloody  marjorie manages to get an upper hand on her attacker  knocking the living daylights out of the jerk and renders him helpless thanks to wasp spray in his eyes and throat  hog tied and battered himself  joe tries to explain himself to marjorie  s roommates diana scarwid and alfrie woodard  when they get home  there is almost a hint of mercy  but it is not coming from marjorie  should she continue to render her own punishment  violence  sexual abuse and rough language makes for an r rating  fawcett really gets away from the ditsy roles that would forever stain her career  kudos to director robert m  young             i find it sad that just because edward norton did not want to be in the film or have anything to do with it  people automatically think the movie sucks without even watching it or giving it a chance  i really hope norton did not do this  he is a fine actor and all but he scared people away from a decent movie  br    br   i found it entertaining  it wasn  t mind blowing or anything with crazy special effects  but it was not a bad  it was fun to watch  but yea  definitely not a bad horrible movie  br    br                   i watched this movie on tv last night  hoping for a realistic account of what could happen if there were an outbreak of some highly transmittable disease  i was disappointed  and i think the movie was garbage  it did not seem real to me  some of the acting was awful  in particular that of the doctor  she was about the worst i  ve seen  the whole thing played like a cnn   worst case scenario    even the obligatory disaster movie human relations bits didn  t seem sincere  i have seen some disaster movies  in particular those weather ones  which are actually so bad they are amusing  this one is almost as bad  but it is not even amusing  it is tedious and boring don  t bother with this one             for those out there that like to think of themselves as reasonably intelligent human beings  who love film  have good attention to detail and enjoy indie movies with funny  smartly written dialogue then this is a film for you  br    br   for those with a poor attention span  high expectations and no brains   well   um   you may get bored and find things dragging at times  br    br   this is a charming  modest and well paced movie with the actors bestowing a real sense of depth and warmth to their roles  i chuckled to myself pretty much the whole way through   br    br   this film is a little gem             the great caruso was the biggest hit in the world in      and broke all box office records at radio city music hall in a year when most   movergoers   were stay at homes watching their new     motorola televisions  almost all recent box office figures are false     because they fail to adjust inflation  obviously today  s     movies will dominate  in      it cost   c to       at radio city    c to   c first run at loew  s palace in washington dc  or   c to   c in neighborhood runs  what counts is the number of people responding to the picture  not unadjusted box office   media spin    the genius of the great caruso was that the filmmakers took most of the actual life of enrico caruso  really not a great story anyway  and threw it in the trash  instead      of the movie  s focus was on the music  thus mgm gave us the best living opera singer mario lanza doing the music of the best ever historic opera singer enrico caruso  the result was a wonderful movie  too bad lanza would throw his life and career away on overeating  too fat to play the student prince  edmund purdom took his place     with lanza  s voice dubbed in  and with the formerly handsome and not fat lanza pictured in the advertising  if you want to see the great caruso  it  s almost always on ebay for       or less  don  t be put off by the low price  as it reflects only the easy availability of copies  not the quality of the movie             i attended an advance screening of this film not sure of what to expect from kevin costner and ashton kutcher  both have delivered less than memorable performances   films  while the underlying   general   storyline is somewhat familiar  this film was excellent  both costner and kutcher delivered powerful performances playing extremely well off each other  the human frailties and strengths of their respective characters were incredibly played by both  the scene when costner confronts kutcher with the personal reasons why kutcher joined the coast guard rescue elite was the film  s most unforgettable emotional moment  the   specific   storyline was an education in itself depicting the personal sacrifice and demanding physical training the elite coast guard rescuers must go through in preparation of their only job   responsibility   to save lives at sea  the special effects of the rescue scenes were extremely realistic and   wowing     i haven  t seen such angry seas since   the perfect storm    co star clancy brown  hbo  s   carnivale     great to see him again  played the captain of the coast guard  s kodiak  alaska base in a strong  convincing role as a leader with the prerequisite and necessary ice water in his veins  the film wonderfully  and finally  gives long overdue exposure and respect to the coast guard  it had the audience applauding at the end                i am not weapon expert  but even i can see difference between u s  army riffles in wwi and wwii  in movie we can see privates  armed with   m  garand    invented in year         not authentic        springfield    aka   silent death     who privates use until wwii  difference   m  can load     times more ammunition and   times more fire rate  m  was semi   automatic  springfield requires reloading after every shot  little difference      german army uniforms has borrowed from      year too  especially   helmets  german helmets until end of wwi have significant pike on top  we cannot see even one in movie  and if we make little additional search in archives   how much truthful is this   true story    i am surprised  how much   truthful   can be film directors in a pursuit of cheap propagation             do you ever wonder what is the worst movie ever made  stop wondering  i  m telling you  michael is it  br    br   it is not   heartwarming      entertaining    or   travolta at his best    it just sucks  if i had kids  i would let them watch deep throat before michael  br    br   a sold out john travolta  a washed up and balding william hurt  and an about to die any time now jean stapleton highlight this turd of a film  br    br   but wait   you  ll get to hear andie mcdowell sing  yeah  hollywood really s  t all over us with this one             the film began with wheeler sneaking into the apartment of his girlfriend  her aunt  edna may oliver  a person too talented for this film  didn  t like wheeler  a sentiment i can easily relate to  the aunt decided to take this bland young lady abroad to get her away from wheeler  they left and wheeler invested in a revolution in a small mythical kingdom because they promised to make him their king  at about the same time  woolsey was in the same small mythical kingdom and he was made king  so when wheeler arrived  it was up to the boys to fight it out  but they refused because they are already friends  which greatly disappointed the people  as killing and replacing kings is a national pastime  br    br   i am a huge fan of comedy from the golden age of hollywood  the silent era through the     s  i have seen and reviewed hundreds  if not thousands of these films and yet despite my love and appreciation for these films i have never been able to understand the appeal of wheeler and woolsey  the only comedy team that might be as bad as the ritz brothers  despite being very successful in their short careers in hollywood  cut short due to the early death of robert woolsey   i can  t help but notice that practically every other successful team did the same basic ideas but much better  for example  there were many elements of this film reminiscent of the marx brother  s film  duck soup  yet cracked nuts never made me laugh and duck soup was a silly and highly enjoyable romp  at times  woolsey talked a bit like groucho  but his jokes never have punchlines that even remotely are funny  in fact  he just seemed to prattle pointlessly  his only funny quality was that he looked goofy  surely not enough reason to put him on film  additionally  wheeler had the comedic appeal of a piece of cheese  a piece of cheese that sang very poorly  a missed opportunity was the old vaudeville routine later popularized by abbott and costello as   who  s on first   which was done in this film but it lacked any spark of wit or timing  in fact  soon after they started their spiel  they just ended the routine  so prematurely that you are left frustrated  i knew that   who  s on first   had been around for many years and used by many teams  but i really wanted to see wheeler and woolsey give it a fair shot and give it their own twist  br    br   once again  i have found yet another sub par film by this duo  while i must admit that i liked a few of their films mildly  such as silly billies and the rainmakers  which i actually gave    s to on imdb   this one was a major endurance test to complete  something that i find happens all too often when i view the films of wheeler and woolsey  where was all the humor              i was really hoping that this would be a funny show  given all the hype and the clever preview clips  and talk about hype  i even heard an interview with the show  s creator on the bbc world today   a show that is broadcast all over the world  br    br   unfortunately  this show doesn  t even come close to delivering  all of the jokes are obvious   the kind that sound kind of funny the first time you hear them but after that seem lame   and they are not given any new treatment or twist  all of the characters are one dimensional  the acting is   well   mediocre  i  m being nice   it  s the classic cbc recipe   one that always fails  br    br   if you  re muslim i think you would have to be stupid to believe any of the white characters  and if you  re white you  d probably be offended a little by the fact that almost all of the white characters are portrayed as either bigoted  ignorant  or both  not that making fun of white people is a problem   most of the better comedies are rooted in that  it  s only a problem when it isn  t funny   as in this show  br    br   canada is bursting with funny people   so many that we export them to hollywood on a regular basis  so how come the producers of this show couldn  t find any             first of all   mexican werewolf in texas   is not a werewolf movie  this title is bullcrap  the story is actually about a chupacabra that kills all the local villagers in the little town of furlough in texas  i suppose the distributors renamed the original title so that it would make some extra bucks or something  and i guess it actually works because that  s the reason why i bought this piece of crap  it sounded so stupid  anyway the movie isn  t any good  actually it  s bloody awful  but i didn  t expect anything else when i bought it  it  s a low budget horror movie with a chupacabra monster  if you enjoy low budget horror with bad dialog  actors and some gore then you should check into this movie  but i must warn you  this movie is really baaaaaaad  br    br   this movie has some of the worst acting i have ever seen  the actors try to hard and t it gets completely ridiculous  they almost never say a line in a normal way  they always have this completely wrong tone about just everything they say  it  s so stupid it almost looks like a freakin parody  it  s like they shot each scene only one single time and were happy about it  the worst of them all is the blond girl which is supposed to play a bimbo  she  s the worst of them all  i have never seen an actor as bad as her  and i  ve seen pteradactyl   even when her boyfriend dies she can  t stop being a bimbo about it  i hate her  br    br   some of the shots in this movie were actually quite good  the ones that where shot in the daytime are all pretty decent for a low budget project  but most of the movie is shot in the night when the chupacabra strikes and the lighting is way too dark  the gore scenes are few and short  but really grizzly and violent  the effects are pretty hilarious really  but that  s the way i like it  the chupacabra looks pretty messed up  and it  s easy to see that it  s a guy in suit  br    br   overall this movie should only be watched by extreme fans of low budget flicks and it  s very important to not watch this alone because you will probably be bored to death  i recommend watching this flick with your friends and some beer             this movie is so god awful that it was literally a chore to watch  i wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room  but kept thinking  foolishly  that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right    you lose  we win  yay    this movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that jackie mason was funny  after that  beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks  and if you  re even considering renting this turd  or worse yet  have   i have one thing to ask of you  didn  t you even look at the cover  i mean  with crap like this you can tell with just a glance how bad it is    oy vey    this movie sucked             the symbolic use of objects  form editing  the position of characters in the scene    these were all used with such joyous abandon by hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had  the way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses  the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger    while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards  in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken  even the title has a least four meanings that i can see  the boxing ring  the wedding ring  the bracelet the lover buys  and the love triangle at the heart of the story             i found this movie to be very good in all areas  the acting was brilliant from all characters  especially ms stone and morissey  tramell  s character just gets smarter and more psychologically twisted by the minute  the plot is interesting even though  this movie is more for the mind playing between the main characters and how catherine continues her writing with new ways and twists for her novels  the setting was also fabulous and the whole atmosphere of the movie was that mysterious thriller like masterpiece  go see this film now   it deserves better than what it got from the audience  which was misled by some faulty terrible reviews about the movie before it even started      you won  t regret it if you go see it               rather like paul newman and steve mcqueen with their racing car movies this has all the appearance of a   jollies   project for robert redford  as he gets to ski up hill and down dale in the alpine sunshine  br    br   the story is as light as powdered snow with redford  s small town boy david chappellet  what kind of lead name is that   who with his eyes on the prize of olympic glory  gets up the nose of  in no particular order  his coach  father and team mates  women are a mere side show in his insular world as evidenced by a fairly distasteful pick up scene with an old girlfriend in his hometown and then his selfishly petulant pursuit of  heavens above  a free thinking  independent woman  played by camilla sparv  the ski ing sequences are fine with some good stunt work involving numerous bumps and scrapes on the piste but their effectiveness is dimmed by our subsequent familiarity with top tv coverage of skiing events down to the present day  plus i  m not convinced that the winter olympics has the same mass identification with the general public as the summer games so that when redford eventually wins his gold medal in the final reel  i couldn  t really be that excited for him one way or another  br    br   of the actors  redford  best profile forward  doesn  t need to do much and indeed doesn  t  while gene hackman does better with equally meagre material  ms sparv does well as the chief female interest well who treats redford the way he  s doubtless treated every other woman in his chauvinistic way  br    br   in truth though  there  s a lack of dramatic tension throughout for which the action sequences don  t fully compensate and you don  t care a fig for any of the leading characters  one of those films where the actors probably enjoyed making it more than the viewers did watching it             i would recommend this film to anyone who is searching for a relaxing  fun filled  thought provoking movie  the absence of sex  vulgarities and violence made for a most pleasant evening  i especially enjoyed the buffalo scene  but that  s probably because i live a short distance from there  even so  this film could have been produced in any city  it  s the theme that  s so important here  i  m just grateful that manna from heaven dropped down on us  try it   you  ll like it             this is an art film that was either made in      or       the national film preservation foundation says      and imdb says        regardless of the exact date  the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period  with some camera work and pop art stylings that are pure late   s early   s  br    br   the film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks  these distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely no dialog or plot of any sort  this was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art  and like most performance art  it  s interesting at first but quickly becomes tiresome  the film  to put it even more bluntly  is a total bore and would appeal to no one but perhaps those who made the film  their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and   with it   to be understood by us mortals             i read the book and saw the movie  both excellent  the movie is diamond among coals during this era  liebman and selby dominate the screen and communicate the intensity of their characters without flaw  this film should have made them stars  shame on the studio for not putting everything they had behind this film  it could have easily been a franchise  release on dvd is a must and a worthy remake would revive this film  look for it in your tv guide and if you see it listed  no matter how late  watch it  you won  t be disappointed  do yourself another favor   read the book  same title   it  ll blow you away  times have changed dramatically since those days  or at least we like to think they have             a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town  leading to all kinds of complications  cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can  t escape the title town  hopper does what he does best  playing a psycho known as   lyle from dallas    the real hit man  walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast  the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns  and john  s direction creates a terrific   neo noir   atmosphere  witty and very entertaining  it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up             i really liked this movie  i have seen several gene kelly flicks and this is one of his best  i would actually put it above his more famous american in paris  sometimes it seems the story gets lost in gene kelly movies to the wonderful dance and song numbers  but not in this movie  it is definitely worth renting             although promoted as one of the most sincere turkish films with an amateur cast  ice cream  i scream is more like a caricature of sincerity  br    br   the plot opens with the dream of ali  a traveling ice cream salesman in a western anatolia town  in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big ice cream companies  he dreams of playing in his product  s tv commercial with beautiful models in bikinis  dancing around him  as his dream turns into a nightmare  he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife  who rejects to make sex with him for   years with no apparent reason  is it because he is not successful in his job  apparently  because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global ice cream companies  but this is what he says  we actually don  t see him suffer that much  he still sells good  traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop  selling ice cream to the people in the town  ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real   sahlep    powdered roots of mountain orchids   ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor  and gives ads to a local tv channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect  his wife is not fond of his ways of doing business  they always quarrel  and ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzy  br    br   in a very successful day  his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town  in search of his stolen bike  ali goes to the police  blames the big companies for the theft  but  of course  nobody takes him seriously  annoyed by the nagging of his wife  ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk  one of his friends at his table  a wannabe socialist of the town  gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism  and with no real connection  jumps to the subject of global freezing  ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison  his wife wakes up and prevents him  an old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life  according to him  ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing  when he returns home  suddenly we see that his wife understood his value  treating him like a hero and praising his manhood  meanwhile  the thief boys got sick eating too much ice cream  they confess to the doctor that they stole ali  s bike  ali forgives them and there comes the happy end  br    br   although the plot may look promising in a way  it  s the story telling which makes this film insincere and cheesy  first  the director doesn  t show much of an effort to tell the story visually  everything is based on dialogs  and the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art  even ali  s troubles are not convincing because we don  t see it  we just understand it from his words  the director markets his film as a righteous fight of ali against big ice cream companies  but there is nothing in the film about big companies  we don  t see their pressure enough  the film actually ridicules ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft  and when his motorbike is found  it solves every problem  ali becomes a happy and powerful husband  not a real criticism of globalism  br    br   second  the film is cheesy because of the crude humor  maybe the people of that part of turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life  but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny  i may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and   clever   but they are not clever jokes at all  they are just cheesy  maybe i  m wrong  maybe american people may like oriental version of american pie style humor  but american pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the oscars  or to have a political message  if you think that you can laugh by just seeing a man  s big erection in his shorts  and we had to endure this joke twice   or an old villager woman saying   f  k you    then you may find this film funny             stan laurel and oliver hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history  and deservedly so  so i am happy to see any of their films  ollie is recovering from a broken leg in hospital  and with nothing else to do  stan decides to visit him  and take him some boiled eggs and nuts  instead of candy  chaos begins with stan curiously pulling ollie  s leg cast string  and manages to push the doctor  billy gilbert  out the window  clinging on to it  getting ollie strung up to the ceiling  when the situation calms down  stan gets ollie  s clothes  as the doctor wants them both to leave  and he also manages to sit on a syringe  accidentally left by the nurse  filled with a sleeping drug  which comes into effect while he is driving  which you can tell is done with a car in front of a large screen  filled with some likable slapstick and not too bad  although repetitive and a little predictable  classic comedy  it isn  t great  but it  s a black and white film worth looking at  stan laurel and oliver hardy were number   on the comedians   comedian  okay             ok i have to admit that i quite enjoyed house of the dead despite its well documented failings  this however was the worst film i have seen since demons at the door  compared to datd the effects are vastly superior  however the plot is weak  the acting reminiscent of everyone  s favourite  the porn film  and the decisions and actions of the   characters   consistently verge on the moronic  i feel like trying out uwe boll  s latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over hotd   i am not suggesting that he is really the cure  more a case of a different disease  but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up  ok there it is  i have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is house of the dead               i was  unlike most of the reviewers  not born in the     s  i was born on may   th       despite this  my life was very much in the style of the     s  when other kids had playstations  i was playing zelda on my nes etc  now  this movie holds a special place in my heart already despite me being only    years old at the time of writing this review  i  because of my     s style early childhood  watched many tv shows and saw many movies that other kids didn  t see  and this movie was one of those  and one of the greatest too  br    br   it starts off in the los angeles home of alvin seville  simon seville  theodore seville and david seville  david  the chipmunk  s adoptive father  is in a rush to get to the airport as he is going on a business trip around europe  his taxi is almost there and the chipmunks help him pack  while they are talking  alvin expresses his will to come with dave and to see the world  even though  technically dave is only going to europe  so to alvin  apparently only america and europe qualify as     the world       david is leaving the chipmunks in the care of miss miller  much to the displeasure of the boys  soon dave is off to the airport and the chipmunks are left at home with miss miller  later  at a local caf   the chipmunks are playing a game of     around the world in    days     against the chipettes brittany  jeanette and eleanore   after losing the game to brittany after having his hot air balloon eaten out of the sky by a crocodile  alvin get  s in an argument with brittany about who would really win a race around the world  two diamond smugglers sitting at a nearby table  klaus and claudia furschtien overhear their argument and  needing a safe way of transporting their diamonds over the world  decide to fool the children into delivering them for them  they set up a race around the world  where each team will have to deposit a doll in their own likeness  secretely filled with diamonds  at drop offs around the world and receive a doll in the opposing team  s likeness  secretely filled with the payment for the diamonds  to     varify that they were there      the winning team would then receive a         dollar reward  they do this because they believe that jamal  an interpol agent who has been hot on their heels for some times now  would never suspect them because they are just kids  however  this seems to be redundant  because on their travels  the kids do not have to go through any security checks and are never even questioned about the dolls  i suspect that neither would klaus or claudia if they had taken the diamonds there personally   and so begins a great adventure  this film is a classic and i see no reason why anyone would not like it  it features great animation and top notch voice acting  not to mention the kick ass music  pardon my french  p   my favorite song is without a shred of doubt     the girls and boys of rock and roll     an amazing rock song that cannot be topped  it  s also my favorite moment in the film  other notable songs include     getting lucky     kind of suggestive for a kid  s film eh   and     my mother     as well as     wooly bully     and     off to see the world     not to mention the main theme of the movie heard during the opening credits performed by the royal london philharmonic orchestra  the scene with     my mother     still brings a tear to my eye  in relation to the song     getting lucky     i first didn  t think anything of it  but when i grew older and learned about life  it became clear that that song was a little bit suggestive  that song  along with the fact that the animators insist on the audience knowing the color of the chipettes panties  this is especially apparent in the scene in egypt when the chipettes are being chased by the arabian prince  s men  when eleanor leans over the side of the hot air balloon basket and her skirt defies gravity completely  while this does nothing to draw from the overall quality of the film  it  s one of those unexplained things like why nobody in the world seems to mind that there are   feet tall chipmunks walking around and speaking in incredibly high pitched voices and treat them just like they would any human child  anyway  a bit after that scene  the chipettes discover the diamonds in the dolls and decide to go find the chipmunks and get home  the direction of janice karman perfects this movie as she and her husband  ross bagdasarian jr  know the characters better than anyone  they even do the voices of the chipmunks and the chipettes  ross doing the voices for alvin and simon  as well as dave  and janice doing the voices for all the chipettes and theodore  speaking of male characters that are voiced by female voice actresses  nancy cartwright  the voice of bart simpson  makes an appearance in this movie  she plays the part of the arabian prince  a very small  but important role  the ending is of course  a happy one  the crooks have been caught  the loose ends tied and the film ends when the children  dave and miss miller are driving into the sunset  alvin complaining about not having gotten his         dollar reward for winning the race  which annoys dave until he finally yells     alvin      and the screen fades to black br    br   classic ending  by the way  i hope you found my review of this movie useful  and if you haven  t seen this flick  give it a watch  it  s worth the money  this nostalgic classic from the     s gets a solid    out of      br    br       headin   for the top  don  t you know  we never stop believing now                just when i thought i would finish a whole year without giving a single movie a   bomb   rating  a friend brought this notorious turd to my house last night  i feared the worst knowing its reputation  and it was as god awful as i  d anticipated  this is a mexican made mess  dubbed into english  and produced by k  gordon murray  it  s got terrible sets and effects  and features a rather frightening santa who doesn  t operate at the north pole  but instead from a cloud in outer space  and who doesn  t have little elves helping him make his toys but rather all different groups of children from practically every country there is  the opening sequence  where st  nick chuckles heartily as he observes monitors showing all these kiddies working hard while singing terrible holiday songs in a variety of languages  seems to go on forever  and with no story  obviously  this santa claus doesn  t observe the child labor laws  br    br   eventually we get some nasty and slinky red suited apprentice of the devil himself traveling from hell to earth  just to make little kids naughty and turn santa  s christmas eve rounds into a nightmare  watching this movie is a trippy and twisted experience  and it  s bound to frighten little children and turn them off santa claus and the holidays forever  oddly  the name of jesus christ is mentioned often in this christmas film  which somehow makes it all the creepier in the context of all the bizarre things that are going on  this easily makes my personal list of the   worst movie i  ve ever seen    but i  m sure that  s nothing unique             as is often the case when you attempt to take a     plus page book and cram it into a two hour film  a lot is lost  here director john madden  shakespeare in love  takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off  what we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete  br    br   there is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic  the cinematography by john toll  cinematographer for braveheart and legends of the fall  winning oscars for both  is splendid  working with madden  the choices for locations on the greek island of kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful  madden also uses numerous greek actors as the townspeople  giving the town an authentic feel  the soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the italian soldiers are marvelous  br    br   madden does an excellent job of bringing us the italian occupation and the romance  which take up the greater part of the film  there are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment  however  by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold  there isn  t much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated  while the battle scenes are well done  subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long  by the time we reach the post war scenes  the treatment is merely skeletal  another negative is that the dvd is particularly sparse on features  br    br   nicholas cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight  when fight he must  cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas  br    br   penelope cruz  whom the camera loves  gives an uninspired performance as pelagia  in part this is because cage so dominates the screen  but cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic  she allows the character to be objectified as corelli  s love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right  br    br   john hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor  who knows as much about human nature as medicine  however  christian bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as pelagia  s fianc    br    br   i rated this film an       despite some drawbacks  this is a touching film that is well worth seeing  the photography alone is worth the price of admission             my father grew grew up watching george reeves as superman and when i was a little kid he had episodes on vhs and let me view them including this movie  passing them down in the family if you will   and i loved it  br    br   clark kent and lois lane get sent to a small town with and oil mine and from the mine emerge mole men radioactive and targeted by the town assumed to be deadly and it  s up to superman to stop this mayhem  br    br   it  s just so wonderful and fun to view  the old style special effects and sound   the crew pulled off such a beauty with such little technology  george reeves was my hero when i was a little kid  and i  m    now  it just goes to show how timeless and classic these adventures are            this unpretentious horror film is probably destined to become a cult classic  much much better than     of the scream rip offs out there  i even hope they come up with a sequel            i read the book before watching the movie and it left me emotionally drained but i felt that it truly transported me to afghanistan  a culture i know very little about  i had great hopes for this movie and it did not disappoint  i watched this with someone who didn  t read the book and he also enjoyed it  they had to shorten some things in the movie but it was a well acted and well shot film  it leaves you thinking about the movie long after it is over  you feel for the characters and their plights  i highly recommend this movie to those who like emotionally draining drama and want to experience afghani culture  there are some disturbing scenes not suitable for children to watch  it is a heavy drama depicting the horrors of life under a restrictive regime             years ago  sara  a young girl witnessed her parents being murdered  now as an adult she suffers from various mental ailments  did i mention she has an imaginary friend   this film lulls the viewer  not into a sense of tension  mind you  but rather a sense of sleepiness  deathly boring  i found it hard to sit through as i could feel my eyelids growing heavier and heavier with each endless minute of mindless prattle and supposed   mystery    is sara going crazy  or is it the paranormal  a better question would be  who cares  and the answer to that  no one  no one at all  skip this film  save yourself some time better suited to do other more worthwhile tasks  br    br   my grade  d             in short if you want to watch burt reynolds best films than this one must be included  if you don  t like burt you may still like this  if you love burt this may become one of your favorite movies of all time  being from atlanta it does hit home but it  s also nice to see a cop action drama that takes place somewhere other than ny city  chicago  miami  or la  the film is funny at points with   good plot   good performances from a great supporting cast  every character is real   the bad guys are not so one sided they are really well thought out a nice offbeat romance in the  nd half   it has some good old fashion shootouts   fistfights  no cgi thank god real action   br    br   if clint eastwood did his best impression of a burt reynolds movie with   every which way but loose       any which way you can   then burt responded with his best clint type flick with this    it comes off great             i have watched love jones over thirty times  it is one of the rare films that depict a love story about people who happen to be african americans  the dialogue was realistically written  and delivered with honesty  it was so nice to see a film where the story line centered on young professional african americans  this is virtually an untapped market  love jones was visually captivating as well  the chemistry between lorenz tate and nia long will bring memories of past and present love  the feeling of the film is jazz and blues  and brings to mine the sensuality of a warm creamy hot chocolate with a splash of kahlua and butterscotch  if you hadn  t guessed  i loved it             the basic genre is a thriller intercut with an uncomfortable menage a trois  fellowes has tried to make a lot more out of this  using the lies of the title in order to bring about all manner of small twists  invariably designed to surprise the characters more than the audience  br    br   it  s really rather messy though  fellowes doesn  t seem interested presenting the thriller elements in a fashion that will keep us seat edged  rather his focus is on the moral predicaments themselves  br    br   the dialogue is inconsistent  stagey here  vernacular there and with the constant surprise of realism undone by the occasional clich   landmine  though there is no fussing over the locations so that the actors can get on with existing in their space the dreadful score can  t create a further dimension and often works against the emotional momentum of given set pieces  there  s also a very prosaic  dare i say it british feel to the filming  i didn  t want to see a document of two successful middle class people caught in an extraordinary situation  i wanted to see some sort of artful recounting of the story  br    br   finally it is  in fact  the story which lets the rest down  just as the elements of suspense are rather flat so the story is an asymmetric sum of subplots of different shapes and sizes  woven as a vehicle for character examination  wilkinson and watson support this meta essay with good performances and john warnaby  s ebullient colleague simon to wilkinson is a welcome foil for much of the brow furrowing  br    br   i  m disappointed  not that it  s bad  but that it could have been much better                  this is absolutely the best movie i have ever watched  at the age of    i was up late and ran across the movie  it was on the usa channel  gilbert godfrey  s up all night  i will never forget  at the time my friends and i were really struggling with different issues  some sexual  you know    is a very rough and weird age  it seems you are stuck in between being a little girl  and being a young lady  this movie really helped to answer a lot of questions for me  i now have a daughter that is     have been searching for a couple years for this movie  if it ever does come out on dvd i would be the first to buy  would recommend for any parent to watch this with their child when they reach that very rough and difficult age             holes is an awesome movie  i love it a lot and it  s one of my favorite films  it  s one of the few flicks produced by disney that isn  t cheesy  holes is generally a very cool motion picture  i wish disney would make more pictures like it  holes is indeed a rare breed of disney flicker shows that is cool  don  t get the wrong idea  i don  t mean to bad mouth disney but most of it  s stuff is aimed towards kids and that  s okay  children deserve to have their entertainment too  but disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail  but not with holes  it  s the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think it  s corny  really  it  s the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate to  br    br   holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge  i hope disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this             i cannot hate on the show  when the old  and better  tech tv had to hit the bricks  the channel was reformatted and new shows stepped in    attack of the show   is the replacement for the screen savers  with   co hosts in the beginning  they were kevin rose  kevin pereira and sarah lane  brendan moran came to be something of a co host as well  but he mostly did prerecorded pieces for the show  kevin rose decided to leave the show  and eventually there was a contest to see who would be the third host  but that didn  t pan out for some reason  br    br   eventually  i just learned this from this very imdb messageboard  sarah lane and brendan moran moved on because  hey  this is what i read  the two got married  that was a big secret to me  now there is a new female co host  the not as hot  my opinion  olivia munn  she  s hiding something in those tops she wears  while sarah lane had a perfect body and she wasn  t afraid to show it  br    br   ahem  sorry  br    br     attack of the show   deals with everything young people want to know about  it  s music  movies  comic books  the internet and television  this is what  s great about the show  if you don  t want to bother with scouring the net or waste time watching mtv  you can get all you want on aots  some segments and bits they do are funny  they have regular guests and contributors who are in the industry  as well as guests who range from insignificant internet stars to actual big names  br    br   even though the hosts aren  t as geek as i  d like them to be  i still have found   attack of the show   to be entertaining  even with its latest lineup             worst dcom i have seen  ever  well  maybe not as bad as smart house  this was just bad  the acting and story was fine  but the effects sucked  br    br   they were so fake  the only good fight scene was between the brother and shen  that was probably the only scene in which i was excited  br    br   overall  i found this movie very boring and the film kind of ended suddenly   br    br   i will give it a four for brenda song who is a very funny actress and that one fight scene  br    br                   its awful i cant believe that one of the greatest nonsenses in the world can be a blockbuster and the favorite movie of millions of people                      a movie which has no story again shahrukh khan has been appeared on the screen with nothing new the same as usual he is trying to make you cry by start scrambling his head for thousands of times i think this is to much pretty zinta spouse to act the character of a pakistani girl i didn  t know that there is enough facilities in pakistan for the pakistani girls to do so many plastic surgeries on their face and also there are enough make up facilities     and also i didn  t know that an indian can cross the march  s between both countries go to pakistan and start dancing and singing may be pakistani soldier  s were sleeping                     some people may call   cooley high   the same sort of thing as   american graffiti    but i wouldn  t  for starters  in   ag    everyone was white  whereas in   ch   they  re all black  moreover  this one has a motown soundtrack  specifically  the movie focuses on several working class african american students in      chicago and their antics  the movie deals mainly with home life and relationships  in their apartments  we see that there  s never any dad around  but these young men always know how to live life to the fullest  br    br   one thing that really distinguishes this movie from most other portrayals of black people is that the teenagers in this movie are portrayed as very responsible  worrying about missing school  two really funny scenes are the gorilla scene  and the one white guy in the movie  but overall  the main star is the soundtrack  it is truly one of the best soundtracks in movie history  we even have it on vinyl here at home   a classic in the real sense of the word             so wonderful  so quirky  so romantic  so italian  the film is so feather  light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again  a kitchen sink world of bakeries  and hairdressers  and plumbing  but one that shimmers with a soft luminescence  should the credit go to the screenplay or the direction  take your pick    they  re both faultless  let me get back to that new york city that lies just beyond the looking glass             this film is  quite simply  brilliant  the cinematography is good  the acting superb and the story absolutely breathtaking  this is the story of donald woods  a white south african who thought himself a liberal until he found out the reality of apartheid  kevin kline is completely convincing   so much so that when donald woods himself appeared on tv some years later  i recognised him from kline  s portrayal  denzel washington also turns in a masterful performance  as ever  br    br   i urge you to watch this  it is long  but it is worth your patience because it tells such an incredible story  remember  folks  this really happened             i have recently seen this production on dvd  it is the first time i have seen it since it was originally broadcast in      and it was just as good as i remembered  at first as was worried it would seem old fashioned and i suppose it is a little dated and very wordy as the bbc serials were back then   i miss those wonderful costume dramas that seemed to be always on sunday afternoons back then  but that aside it is as near perfect as it could have been  i am a bit of a   jane eyre   purist as it is my favourite book and have never seen another production that is a faithful to the book as this one  i have recently re read the book as well and some of the dialogue is just spot on  reading the scene near the end where rochester questions jane about what st john was like i noticed their words were exactly reproduced on screen by dalton and clarke and done perfectly   br    br   all the other productions that have been done all seem lacking in some way  some even leave out the   rivers   family and their connection to jane altogether  i also think this is the only production to include the   gypsy   scene done correctly  br    br   the casting is perfect  zelah clarke is like jane is described in the book   small plain and dark   and i disagree that she looked too old  timothy dalton may be a little too handsome but he is absolutely perfect as rochester  portraying every aspect of his character just right and acting his socks off  i agree with other comment that he even appears quite scary at time  like in the scene when he turns around slowly at the church when the wedding is interrupted  his expression is fantastically frightening  but then in another favourite scene his joy is wonderful to see when jane runs down the stairs and into his arms the morning after they declare their love for one another  a love that is wonderfully portrayed and totally believable  oh to be loved by a man like that  there were a couple of scenes that were strangely missing however  like when jane climbs in to bed with the dying helen and also when rochester takes jane shopping for her wedding things  i thought that one was in it but maybe my memory is playing tricks   br    br   finally if you never see another production of jane eyre   you simply most see this one it is simply perfection             in a time of bad  if not plain awful  comedies  king of queens is more than just a breath of fresh air  it  s a complete oxygen tank  it is in my opinion one of the   best comedy shows of all times  nothing has been this good since married with children  kevin james and jerry stiller are comic geniuses  and believe me  it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius  these guys truly understand what is funny  i could watch ten episodes of seinfeld and wouldn  t get half the laughs from seeing koq just once  other funny people in this show are carrie  janet heffernan  spence and doug pruzan  carrie  s boss   i  m so happy they managed to get so many seasons from this gem  the show has been a hilarious winner in a time of mostly comic losers  check it out if you haven  t              prey  br    br   aspect ratio         br    br   sound format  mono br    br   a lesbian couple  sally faulkner and glory annan  living in a remote country house are driven apart by the arrival of a young man  barry stokes  who turns out to be a flesh eating alien  the vanguard of a massive invasion    br    br   despite its shoestring budget and leaden pacing  norman j  warren  s follow up to satan  s slave        amounts to a great deal more than the sum of its meager parts  thanks to a surprisingly complex script by max cuff  apparently  his only writing credit   faulkner and annan indulge an obsessive relationship whilst living in isolated splendor within the english countryside  rendered alternately beautiful and ominous by derek v  browne  s eye catching cinematography   though annan  s discovery of bloodstained clothing in an upstairs room marks one  or both  of these doe eyed lovelies as psychologically disturbed  which may explain the absence of their respective families  some of whom appear to have lived in the house at one time or another and   left   under mysterious circumstances  stokes   unexpected arrival throws the relationship into disarray  partly because faulkner has a pathological hatred of men and partly because annan is attracted to him  creating tensions which result in a climactic whirlwind of violence  there  s an extraordinary  multi layered sequence in which faulkner attempts to   emasculate   their clueless visitor by dressing him in women  s clothing  though stokes   alien mentality allows him to rise above the intended mockery  br    br   in the early scenes  at least  the relationship between faulkner and annan is depicted with uncommon grace and dignity  but this heartfelt sapphic liaison quickly devolves into crowd pleasing episodes of sex and pulchritude  culminating in an explosion of horror when annan allows herself to be ravished by stokes following a violent argument with faulkner  the closing sequences are  quite literally  gut wrenching  especially annan  s final scene  which appears to have been clipped for censorship reasons in      and never fully restored  what remains is still pretty vivid  so brace yourselves    excellent performances by the three leads  bolstered by warren  s unobtrusive direction  which takes full advantage of the stunning woodland locations  thereby compensating for the film  s budgetary shortcomings  originally released in the us as alien prey             the tourist season has just ended on a remote island off the coast of scotland  winter is beginning to set in and the inhabitants  both humans and sheep alike are settling down to much quieter times ahead  michael gaffikin  james warwick  a former paratrooper in the british army  is the local dentist  he  s not an islander by birth and as such his relationship with local artist and cartographer fiona patterson  celia imrie  is always being viewed with a little suspicion  not maliciously  but just out of the protective instincts the tight knit community have for their kin  the islands serenity is broken when gaffikin out for a solitary round of golf finds the headless remains of a brutally slain woman  he immediately reports his gruesome find to insp inskip maurice ro  ves  at the islands police station  inskip arranges for delivery of the remains to local gp  dr goudry  for closer inspection  a quick search for the killer proves fruitless  as does a search for a missing local woman  over dinner that night with michael gaffikin  fiona realises that the dead woman might be sheila anderson  a woman from the mainland  who lives on the island through the winter months  a quick search at her home dove cottage reveals the missing remains of her body  her home proving to be the murder scene  but why did the killer drag her torso over a mile into the woods  suspicion immediately falls on the one stranger left on the island  one colonel howard  jonathan newth who also happened be the last person to see her alive as they came across on the last ferry together  br    br   goudry asks gaffikin for some dental expertise on the victims body  it reveals that she had been torn apart my somebody or something with great strength  one set of teeth marks on the body seem to point at a human killer  another points to that of an unknown animal of some kind  a sheep is found mutilated and then a canadian ornithologist is found slain  with a heavy fog rolling in  the island is cut off from the mainland and any possibility of help  the radio also doesn  t work  seemingly being blocked and the phone lines have been cut  reports of ufo  s and the sighting of a camouflaged soldier are compounded by the finding of an odd looking craft hidden behind rocks on the beach  inskip is confused and refuses to listen to anything but the facts and laughs off gaffikin  s idea that aliens might be involved  but a rise in radioactive levels on the island  has him doubting himself  br    br   the nightmare man is based on the novel  child of the vodyanoi by david wiltshire  it is here adapted by dr who and blake  s   scriptwriter robert holmes and directed by douglas camfield who also had directing experience on both sci fi classics and the film benefits from having such experienced genre experts on board  the nightmare man though is on the whole  a succinctly better crafted piece  that builds its plot alongside solid character development  even down to the minor characters  time is given to giving them all a firm background  the island setting is perhaps a genre clich   that has been used over and over  but its one that i enjoy very much  the remoteness  the sense of being under siege with no way out always add to the atmosphere and here it is given an extra oomph by having an impenetrable fog close in to hamper all efforts  in many genre efforts of this kind it is very easy for proceedings to get silly and for the plot to resort to melodrama  but credit to camfield  he holds it all together with the emphasis being on believability at all times  there is an authenticity about proceedings  the characters even speaking gaelic at times to further this point  if there is one negative about the killer its that  we are given his her its pov for the killings  an acceptable clich   on its own  but when seen through a red filter and a fish eye lens  it just screams of overkill and dates the film just a little  still though you will be hard pressed to guess the outcome or the identity or for that matter the species of the killer  given the clues presented  but it  s a fun and very well acted piece  the local scottish cast are exceptional  the local bobbies roeves and cosmo in particular spar well off each other and are a delight to behold  imrie  never one i  ve taken to in other works  is also pretty good and displays hew womanly physique as if she were in a hammer production  the outlandish  maybe even preposterous ending may irk some viewers  it disappointed me in some ways  but taking into account when it was made  its an understandable and acceptable addendum that if you think about it  is even more terrifying             this review also contains a spoiler of the first movie    so if you haven  t seen either movie and want to but don  t want the spoilers  please don  t read this review  br    br   while this movie is supposed to be about christian and kathryn meeting for the first time  the movie is a poor copy of the first cruel intentions  the actors that they had portray ryan phillippe  s christian and sarah michelle gellar  s kathryn are very poor substitutes indeed  neither can pull off the smarmy  snooty rich kid attitude that the original actors did  it  s absolutely appalling that some of the dialog was verbatim    not so much between christian and kathryn  but if you listen closely enough you  ll recognize it  there are also inconsistencies in the plot   if this were truly the first meeting of christian and kathryn  then why is it that christian fell in love with a girl at the end of the movie  he supposedly was supposed to be in love for the first time in the original movie  with reese witherspoon  s character   br    br   also  the tie in with the photography   you could be a model   comment at the end was totally lame and didn  t add anything at all  overall  this movie was a waste of time  i can  t believe they made a cruel intentions               this movie is ridiculous  it  s attempting to be a comedy but the screenplay is horrible  the whole movie is done in low light and you cant grasp the fact that it  s a comedy  truly is bad cinematography  you really have to sit there and watch it to realize there  s a few jokes here and there going on but either way they  re all inside jokes amongst themselves  this is more like a wannabe drama flick that went bad  it really is a very pointless movie their expressions reveal nothing but dismay and disaster which turns out that way anyway  unless you want to be bored out of your ass  i suggest you stay away from this gag of a movie             in dramatising wilde  s novel  john osborne has condensed events  eliminated a number of characters  and generally implied rather than shown dorian  s essential wickedness  if you want a more explicit rendering  see the      film  wilde and robert louis stevenson lived in about the same time frame  but were certainly vastly different men and writers  this story really treats of a theme similar to stevenson  s   dr  jekyll and mr  hyde    but note that wilde chose to treat his story as fantasy  whereas rls took the scientific route  both the protagonists are men in whom good wars with evil  with evil winning in the end  br    br   the actors in this bbc movie  take a different route  too  from those in the      film  john gielgud says all the same caustic and cynical quips as george sanders  in his role really projecting wilde himself  but with a subtle difference  you  ll suspect that sanders really believed what he was saying  but gielgud may be saying what is expected of him rather than what he sincerely believes  peter firth  too  shows the two sides of his character in restrained fashion  but then we don  t get to see as many of his escapades as hurd hatfield had a chance to display  br    br   it  s a very good production  with the dramatisation reflecting the essentials of the novel  if not all of its ramifications             it starts out like a very serious social commentary which quickly makes one think of other clark movies like kids  bully  etc  but then just as quickly  it unravels into a direction less mess  who is the main character  is this a serious film or some gregg araki esquire over the top goofy film  is this a skate documentary with moments of dialog inserted  i have no clue  i found myself watching the clock and wonder when this turd was going to end  i kept thinking there would be some big shocker culmination which never came  i cut a good    minutes out of the movie by fast forwarding through the pointless skate scenes  yes  it illustrates the changing landscape between the have  s have not  s  i got it way back in the beginning  kids and bully was done in such a way that i actually felt like i was observing the realities of that group of friends  wassup felt very staged  poorly constructed and ever worse acting  teenage caveman  which larry didn  t write but did direct  was terrible  but at least it felt like it was suppose to be a terrible movie that didn  t take itself seriously  wassup rockers was just plain bad             this is my first deepa mehta film  i saw the film on tv in its hindi version with its   sita   character presented as nita  i also note that it is radha who underwent the allegorical trial by fire in the film and not nita sita  yet what i loved about the film was its screenplay by ms mehta  not her direction  the characters  big and small  were well developed and seemed quixotic towards the end  somewhat like the end of mazursky  s   an unmarried woman    they are brave women surrounded by cardboard men  and one cardboard man  ashok  seems to come alive in the last shot we see of him   carrying his invalid mother biji  he seems to finally take on a future responsibility beyond celibacy and adherance to religion   br    br   ms mehta seems to fumble as a director  however  compared to most indian mainstream cinema she would seem to be brilliant  as she cannot use her script to go beyond the microscopic joint family she is presenting except presenting a glimpse of the chinese micro minority in the social milieu of india  she even dedicates the film to her mother and daughter  not her father   yet her radha reminesces of halcyon days with both her parents in a mustard field  compare her to mrinal sen  adoor gopalakrishnan  muzaffar ali and she is dwarfed by these giants  given her competent canadian production team and financial resources  mehta  s film of two bisexual ladies in an indian middle class household may be sacrilege to some  but merely captures the atrophy of middle class homes that does not seem to aspire for something better than its immediate survival in a limited social space  kannada  malayalam  and bengali films have touched parallel themes in india but did not have the publicity that surrounded this film and therefore have not been seen by a wide segment of knowledgeable cinemagoers  br    br   ms das  ms azmi  mr jafri and mr kharbanda are credible but not outstanding  ms azmi is a talented actress who gave superb performances under good directors  mrinal sen  s   khandar    gautam ghose  s   paar    benegal  s   ankur    a brilliance notably absent in this film  ms das sparkled due to her screen presence rather than her acting capability  all in all  the film  s strength remains in the structure of the screenplay which is above average in terms of international cinema  i am sure ms mehta can hone her writing talents in her future screenplays             all the way though i was thinking to myself   oh god why    at the very beginning i thought   right it might be average    but the acting and plot on most parts was atrocious  br    br   every part in it was so predictable  even though the first movie seemed to bare a large resemblance to the ring  it was a half decent movie  but this just seemed to take all the good things about the first and made them terrible  some bits made everyone in the audience wet themselves  eg  the part were geller falls off the building had me in stitches  my girlfriend had to keep telling me to quiet down i was kept commenting on what was bound to happen next  and more times than less i was right  br    br   why does going into the house make her come after you  it doesn  t make sense  it was a poor excuse for a lot of killings  and no really depth was seen at all  br    br   you can see everything coming  which just left you feeling that there was no point in watching  oh shes behind her     didn  t see that one coming  yawns   br    br   surely these people must have thought to    oh i don  t know  carry a knife round or at least try and fight back  instead of being eaten but someone hair  at best during the movie i was very mildly scared  and i mean mildly   i was just crying out for the credits  as they rolled i exhaled a short   oh thank god    if you haven  t already  don  t waste your   time and money on this  pointless  plot less  sorry excuse for a sequel             at       a high school student commits suicide  not shown who has taken their lives or reasons known  time skips back to the start of the day  from here we follow six separate students  marcus  melody  luke  steven  sarah and sean  each student is struggling with their own moral dilemmas  all reaching boiling point  hitting to an end for one  br    br   after losing a friend to suicide  and surviving his own suicide attempt  writer director murali k  thalluri has created a revetting drama focusing on teen life and the horrible act of suicide  suicide has been a topic that has been kept in the shadows       is thalluri  s attempt to bring it to light  if you have been touched by the act of suicide or anyone who has       becomes all the harder to view  br    br   with heavy and hard subject matter  thalluri also tackles everyday teenage life crisis  s  sex  pregnancy  sexual identity  bullying  friendship  thalluri manages and shows them in an extremely realistic manner  the factor on thalluri  s talent is his subtlety  he respect his subject and the problems that everyone will have suffered through at sometime  it verges near documentary at times  it has such a painful realism  the interviews with each character spliced through the film only heightens this  br    br        has a distinctive similarity to gus van sants film elephant  while the core of each film is different  both tackle teen life  like sant  thalluri utilizes long tracking shots  with time skipping back and forth  to show each characters interaction from different perspectives  a defining point to elephant was its ethereal ambiance  with spare conversation  little development of characters  and the long tracking shots  sant created a haunting and mesmerizing atmosphere to a coming dread  while there resides this dread in       the emotional connection to the characters reaches a higher level sant couldn  t reach  as time goes by  each characters fragility creeps out  dragging you along their emotional roller coaster  br    br   the real hit in this film comes with the inevitable suicide  foretold at the very beginning  the hard part about this scene is the complete intrusion and discomfort we have as an audience watching someones life end in a gruesome fashion  though many films that have shown suicide  gloss over the act or romanticizes the act  thalluri shows the pain and agony involved with this act and that its not the best solution  with unknowns in the leads and their first major roles  teresa palmereach  frank sweet  joel mackenzie  marni spillane  charles baird and sam harris all show immense talent and promising acting careers  br    br   compelling and revetting       is an absolutely unmissable film             the quote above just about says it all for   slipstream    i should have bailed out of this film after the first half hour  but decided i ought to be fair and give it a chance  i won  t watch it again  so if anyone with the temerity to do so can get back to me with the number of clich  d lines in the movie  i  m sure it will set a record  br    br   some otherwise fine and talented actors got mixed up with this clunker  mark hamill portrays a futuristic bounty hunter and bill paxton is his quarry  paxton  s character has hijacked hamill  s prisoner  an android taking his name from the poet byron  bob peck   tasker  hamill  shoots owens  paxton  with a dart containing a tracking device so he and his companion belitski  kitty aldridge  can keep tabs on the pair  the real question though is why didn  t he just fire the device at byron thereby cutting out the middleman  br    br   if you enjoy scene after disjointed scene with tedious characterization and artsy fartsy pretense  then i suppose you  ll find something of interest here  but you can  t convince me that the film makes sense on any level  scenes of a futuristic stone age make way for high society snobbery  but the pinnacle of poor taste is reached when paxton  s character is displayed following a night of revelry with hickeys all over his torso  if anyone thinks there  s some hidden meaning here  you  re really stretching  br    br   patiently waiting for the frame proclaiming   the end   to come into view  alas  even that was denied  if beauty is in the eye of the beholder  then so is understanding  this movie had neither  yet there was a single redeeming feature as the closing credits began their run   an awesome view of a half dozen hot air balloons  apparently the film was keeping them afloat             director edward sedgwick  an old hand at visual comedy  successfully leads this hal roach road show which tenders a fast moving and adroit scenario and excellent casting  employing a large number of roach  s reliable performers  although the film was originally plotted as a vehicle for patsy kelly  sunny jack haley stars as joe jenkins  a young kansan who

musical comedy  featuring broadway headliner lyda roberti  laurel and hardy provide several enjoyable interludes  including their well known skit involving a tiny harmonica  and we watch fine turns by such as joyce compton  russell hicks and walter long  on balance  one must hand the bays to mischa auer  who clearly steals the picture as an emotional movie star  a role which he largely creates  and to the director for his clever closing homage to busby berkeley  s filmic spectacles             the jokes are obvious  the gags are corny  and the characters are walking characatures   but i couldn  t stop from laughing at his highly entertaining movie  no matter how many times i see it  i still get a kick out of this one  and i recommend it highly for all lovers of mindless entertainment  it contains many quotable moments  and some of the best sight gags i  ve seen to this day  if you  ve had a bad week and you need a chuckle  rent this one on your way home friday night to give your weekend a good start             these slasher pics are past their sell by date  but this one is good fun  br    br   the valentine cards themselves are witty  and well thought out  br    br   the film has one peach of a line      he  s no angel       when he in fact is angel    watching buffy reruns will never be the same  br    br   the cast is a sizzling display of young talent  but the story does not give them enough real depth  denise richards on the dvd extras seemed to think the girls on set bonded well together and this would give the feeling that you empathised with their characters  sorry but no  br    br   the direction is very good  managing to show very little actual gore  and relying on your imaginations implied threat  much can be said also for the similar manner in which miss richards and heigel do not remove their clothes       br    br   essentially  the main directorial plus  lies within the   borrowing   of various other ideas from previous slasher flicks  psycho  s shower scene is tributed  along with halloween  s   masking     br    br   murdering someone hiding in a bodybag though is a pretty original one as far as i know    br    br   light viewing  not very scary but a few good jump moments  if it was a choice between the hole and this though  choose the hole  slasher movies have had their day  and this is just another slasher  a very good slasher  but nothing groundbreaking               the only reason i gave this episode of   masters of horror   a   instead of a   is because the two lead actors are good  and it wasn  t shot on vhs  the story  the dialog  and the plot are ridiculous   br    br   talking   driving zombies who come back to vote and sway the political tide against the war  give me a break  what next  zombies who come back to go skydiving  maybe zombies who come back to host qvc shows   br    br   i never supported the iraq war  but i do support the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of our armed forces  and   homecoming   was disrespectful in that it mocks the true horror of war   br    br   with zombies being mass produced in today  s market    this is the spam of zombie related entertainment  how   homecoming   made it onto   masters of horror   is beyond me             like most  i thought   another crocodile movie    so far we  ve had primeval and rogue in the last    months  what can they do that  s new  where both those films were about action and violence  this one  s about fear and tension  br    br   the performances aren  t oscar worthy when there  s nothing going on  but in times of distress or terror  these people suffer so much it  s like torture  there are holes in the plot and maybe crocs don  t really behave like this as others have pointed out  but the fear is so effective it  s a stretch to say you  ll enjoy this movie  it  ll leave you feeling as uncomfortable as the passion of the christ             there are a couple of prior comments here which opine about this flick  s abundance of clich  s throughout    and i agree completely  both with regard to the characters and the dialog  br    br   i  d read about elizabeth berkly  s awful performance in the equally awful   showgirls    which i  ve never seen   and her performance here  while not awful  is barely up to the standards of lifetime  s worse fare  there was not a hint of depth to her character  but then there probably shouldn  t have been  if so  it would have placed the film completely out of balance  since there wasn  t a hint of depth or charisma   not a trace   in any one character  performer  or portrayal  br    br   the principal  s handling of liz  s initial complaint after her tutee had kissed her in the hall was laughable  her husband  s initial reaction and advice were likewise  forrest gump  attacking jenny  s boyfriend in his car provided a more realistic  intelligent action  and  hell  he was mentally challenged   br    br   the smarmy  unctuous lawyer  excuse the redundancy  father of the lying student actually performed something probably worthy of praise in his performance  he was both laughable and thoroughly annoying at the same time  no mean feat  her attorney was more of an insensitive nerd  also not unknown in the profession  br    br   finally  and frankly  i rather enjoyed this part   the police were such a collection of insensitive oafs  that you  d rather depend upon barney fife  without andy  to handle all law enforcement and investigation in your community  i know that most real like cops fall a bit short of the sharpness  intelligence and empathy of the level displayed by most characters on the   law and order   series    and the like    but dolts of this level seem to be a staple on   lifetime    br    br   finally  i found a kind of   story within a story   fascination with josh  s concoction of his being the   victim   of his teacher  this scripted performance within the story was even worse than his overall performance in the main story  this was something of an achievement  like going from   f   to   f minus    br    br   this whole lame situation should have been resolved   in real life   in about    minutes  following a realistic meeting between teacher and school authorities  with husband involved  but then that would have precluded the contrived drama following  and left an hour  s blank film in the camera   br    br   but the writer s  here  proved with their ending  they could do even worse  when the situation was finally   resolved   and   righted    this was accomplished in all of about    seconds  with no indication of what measures might have been forthcoming in any   real world   context for the perpetrator and his parents  or whether they might have been able to find some sort of path toward redemption  br    br   this one  s a    presentation  the second       because it does have some mild   fascination               if you haven  t seen this yet  you really should  on dvd  i can  t believe how much i enjoyed it  it is amazingly realistic and believable  true  much of it is speculated  and i would have liked to have known more about what was speculative and what were proven facts  there aren  t many of them   but it handles everything quite well with a   cruel mother nature   theme  it will remind you of the nature programs that you  ve seen on animal planet and the discovery channel  only the animals here are dinosaurs  they act natural  they eat  kill  mate  play  and fight for survival  you will actually find yourself rooting for some of them and against others  br    br   for the most part  the effects are excellent  at times they will look a little too much like cgi  s  but then you will see them in a different angle that makes them look more realistic  in some cases  you will actually be convinced that you  ve seen a dinosaur  my favorites were the coelophysis  the raptors  the diplodocus  the iguanadons  the allosaurus and the arctic bipeds  i was most disappointed with the t rex  however  which looked a little too computer generated at times  br    br   in any case  you should definitely see this production  it is educational  well made  and very entertaining  for what it is  its an a             why is it that canada can turn out decent to good movies in every genre  other then action  i caught dragon hunt on tv the other day and it was like a train wreck  i just could not change the channel  it  s sheer stupidity sapped my willpower  its pretty telling that the cast imdb   credits   with this monstrosity apparently never worked again  br    br   bad acting  bad writing  bad narration  bad music  bad hair  bad cinematography  it just goes on and on  the movie really has nothing to recommend it  if you  re looking for bad action films to enjoy by laughing out  there are a tonne of other films that won  t require you to scorch out your retinas afterwards  br    br   i hope this film didn  t get money from the government for financing  otherwise i  m never paying taxes again             ab tak chhappan is a fictitious story surrounding a police department in mumbai  india  sadhu agashe is a hard working  hard edged cop heading up a plain clothed crime squad who makes a name for himself by killing dangerous criminals in staged police encounters rather than locking them up in prison  his loyal officers obey him without question but a rift forms when one of his officers  imtiaz  becomes frustrated by sadhu  s high ranking status and is secretly competing with him for criminal kills and status  a new recruit is also pushed into the fraternity and imtiaz is angry when sadhu allows him to take the lead on his first case  further change comes in the form of a new police commissioner who disapproves of sadhu  s tactics and everyone gets caught up in internal politics  br    br   i was surprised to see such a well directed action thriller coming from india  the camera work is excellent  the story is well told and the tension is high when the drama unfolds  the acting  pace and political subterfuge convinces the viewer that they are a fly on the wall witnessing the blood  sweat and tears from a close up and personal view and that the events are based on reality which is no doubt why we are told that it is not at the beginning of the film although it is likely that the director  shimit amin  has taken liberties with factual accounts  nevertheless  ab tak chhappan is an extremely polished piece of film making             let  s keep it simple  my two kids were glued to this movie  it has its flaws from an adult perspective  but buy some jelly worms and just enjoy it   br    br   and the pepsi girl was excellent  br    br   and kimberly williams was pretty gosh darned hot  although she  s not in the film very much  so don  t get too excited there  br    br   not that  s it  s really a bad thing  but it is the kind of movie you watch just once  don  t buy the dvd  br    br   enjoy  br    br   did i mention kimberly williams   that was for the dads              it was   a m  in the morning and i had nothing else to do  don  t judge me    please  br    br   we  re back in time during the spanish settlements  a group have made their way onto an island  it doesn  t take too long before they encounter a large   reptile    which gobbles up their horse  soon they  re captured by the natives and in order to gain freedom they must kill the   reptile gods    the cg sucks  it reminds me of the cg of early console video games  the encounters were lame  the only positive thing i have to say about this was the hottie native running around in a skimpy outfit  otherwise it  s just a middling effort             lackawanna blues is and excellent movie  the casting was perfect  every actor and actress was perfectly suited for the role they played  their chemistry together was amazing  the acting was superb  i felt as if i knew the characters  i could almost   feel   them  they reminded me of people that i knew as a child growing up in the     s and     s  oh  the memories   my personal belief is that this movie should have been on the big screen for all to see  i have watched this movie so many times  that i can almost recite the lines as the characters are saying them  i can  t even list my favorite part  because i have so many favorite parts  thank you for bringing back a part of my youth that i never see in this day and age   and that is black people loving each other  looking out for each other  respecting each other  caring about each other  and doing all we can to help each other  gotta go now  i have to go watch it again             saturday june        pm the neptune br    br   monday june        pm the neptune br    br   few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura  s brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz   masterpiece iberia suite  at the approach of its centennial  saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland  the twelve   impressions   of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings  allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura  s camera  creative use of large flats and mirrors  moved throughout the set  combined with screens  shadows  fire  rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song  dance and instrumental performance  photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program  connecting the passion of the music to its great creator  saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors             as most people i am tired of the by the numbers clich  d movies that hollywood makes  there seems to be no creativity in hollywood  companies only want to spend money on remakes are sequels that have an audience built in  br    br   this movie is a welcome change  it could be classified as romantic comedy for it  s genre but don  t let that turn you off this movie  this is a very original movie which is not like most things hollywood produces  br    br   if you are reading this  you already know the basic plot so i will not bother going over that  the only movies that come to mind to compare this to are   interstate      and   art of travel   which are little known gems that take a different path than most of the hollywood garbage  br    br   this is well worth seeing if you are tired of watching more of the same  br    br   dean            many of the reviews and comments i have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by clara bow  although the story line was rather typical of clara  s later silents  i still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun  clara plays a happy go lucky hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves   never mind that this man is married  clara  s lack of modesty was shocking in the day  but i believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie  though definitely not a brilliant story line  quite typical  actually   this movie is a nice showcase of clara  s ability to make the audience laugh             as the number of video nasties i  ve yet to see dwindles  this little pile of garbage popped up on my   to rent   list when i saw it was available  br    br   the premise involves a fashion model or something being kidnapped and taken into the jungle to be held for ransom by a motley crew of idiots  some other goof gets hired to bring her back and is given a sack of money to use as a bargaining chip  though if he returns with the girl and all the money  he gets a significant cut  he  s brought a helicopter and pilot with him and  wow  that pilot is one of the worst actors ever  granted  they are all totally terrible and the dubbing will make you cry blood  after stealing away into the jungle  we learn that nearby is a cannibal cult whose flesheating earthbound god wanders the woods like a human king kong looking for tribeswomen to ravage and devour  now  this fellow is just a naked guy with some of the worst makeup ever  ping pong balls for eyes and that  s pretty much it  his growls and groans are an everpresent feature on the soundtrack  and i found myself muting much of those scenes  br    br   oh  did i forget to mention the almost constant nudity  this is probably the main reason this film was banned  though there is one specific scene  about one second long  where the god attacks a girl and pulls her guts out  but it  s not a redeeming factor for gore fans  also  jess franco goes beyond the usual t and a and shows lengthy close ups of female genitals  and  sadly  male as well  so  if you want   fair   in terms of exploitation  you got it  br    br   i can  t recommend this trash to anyone  it  s not even the good bad movie  it  s just atrociously padded trash that only a video nasty fan will probably view and even then  if you are making your way through the list  leave this for the very last  if you watch it first  you may get the notion that this is the norm for the list  which is certainly not true             i rented this thinking it would be pretty good just by the cover of the movie case  judge and jury started out pretty good killer chasing the man who killed his wife on a bike with a cool gun  but this movie got progressively stupider as it went on  david keith is awesome actor especially when he plays a role like this too bad the movie was a piece of crap it really wasted his talent  judge and jury was well plain dumb i gave it a   should have gave it a    i gave it an extra star just because david keith  s gun was cool             i found out about this film because jewish ben chaplin from game on was in it  game on is a funny british sitcom and apparently he left because he wanted to break into hollywood and star in this film  he failed thank god  br    br   the film is a very simple romantic comedy with janeane garofalo playing an ugly woman who uses her neighbour uma thurman to date ben chaplin because she thinks ben chaplin won  t like her because she  s ugly  the film is just bad for so many reasons  the plot is unbelievably predictable from the overtly slapstick bits to the serious mushy bits  ugh just that montage where all three of them are having fun and then the photograph bit  those two scenes made me cringe  janeane  s character is sickeningly arrogant  and guessing from her role as stand up   comedienne   and arch feminist is in real life too   she claims that the film is   anti feminist   when in fact it  s just realistic  men more often than not go for looks over personality  it  s interesting to note her hypocrisy too  she  d been a feminist and   comedienne   for years before taking this role and then suddenly decides afterwards that the film was bad  i imagine she hated the idea and script of this film before it was released but she made sure she kept that quiet so she could get paid for this travesty of a film  i mean come on  she acted in it for heaven  s sake  what this film was really was anti men if anything  it portrays men as stupid animals whose brains are in their groins with the men doing stupid things to attract the attention of uma thurman  s character noelle  br    br   there are other bad things about this film too like ben chaplin  s character being the british man every american girl finds cute and jamie foxx being the token black best friend of chaplin and of course foxx had to try and mimic his accent a few times for good measure  is that the best the script writers could come up with  blimey they  ve never done that before except with every hugh grant and dudley moore film ever made  there  s also a truly awful phone sex scene which is just grotesque and proves how cheap the film is  the other comments on here all say how janeane garofalo isn  t ugly but is actually beautiful  erm was i watching the same film as they were  she  s certainly no looker and the only good thing about this film was that she was rightly cast as the ugly one  although having said that  i fail to see the appeal of uma thurman as well  she  s lanky and gaunt looking  br    br   i guarantee three things about this film if you  ve never watched it  br    br   you will know what the ending will be  br    br   you will find the phone sex scene painfully embarrassing and  br    br   you will be bored after ten minutes  br    br   watch at your own peril            this movie has everything typical horror movies lack  although some things are far fetched we are dealing with quality snow man engineers  the only preview i can reveal is that i cant wait for jackzilla  dare i say oscar winner  this is a perfect date movie  i advise all men for a nice romantic surprise see this movie with that special person            having just seen walt disney  s the skeleton dance on the saturday morning blog as linked from youtube  i used those same sources to watch a remake done in technicolor for the columbia cartoon unit and animated by the same man ub iwerks  the colors  compared to the earlier black and white  are really used imaginatively here and many of the new gags like when one of the skeletal band players hits a wrong note constantly or when one loses his head and takes another one  s off or when one dances with the other with part of that other gone are just as funny as the previous short  it does get a little repetitious near the end  still  skeleton frolics is well worth seeing for any animation buff who wants to compare this with the earlier silly symphony             the cast of this film contain some of new zealander  s better actors  many of who i have seen in fabulous roles  this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them  the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong  as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry  decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot  most of the cast appear to be from the  great  long running new zealand soap shortland street  it  s as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party  the result of too many gins  and possibly a bit of salmonella  imagine   under siege   meets   the love boat    staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea  br    br   if you are an actor  i recommend you see this film  as a study on how to destroy your carer             emily watson and tom wilkinson together   what a treat  with rupert everett and linda bassett rounding off the supporting roles to the foursome of lies and intrigue  yet at the heart of it all  each character maintains a streak of decency   moral conscience held up in spite of obvious contradictions    contradictions are the source of all movement and of all life    how true these words are  watson  s anne manning is at the core of this intrigue   she  s the central conscience that the other three latched on  she is the decency undeterred   br    br   the circumstances of lies are to each its own  one to defend one  s professional name  one to hold back due to family partner pressure  one simply don  t want to face the consequence  one ironically can  t believe the truth and lies to save friendship  these are all precarious situations  there lies the intrigue   fascinating to watch how each tackles truth and lies  contradictions  indeed  in spite of the seeming dishonor  decency and heart remain strong   br    br   the treatment of the subject involved and how each of the character behaves are masterfully delivered simple with clarity  it  s not sensational or complex as another film   where the truth lies         credits due to fellowes   writing and the nuanced performances of both watson and wilkinson  there is warmth somehow that comes through the seemingly boldface or frustratingly hidden lies  beneath it all  human frailty not excluded  they meant well  and following along with the story  the turn of events provided satisfaction and smiles to how the two manning  s seem to have grown and matured in their relationship   br    br   you might say there  s no obvious action drama or thrilling scenes in   separate lies    yet the intrigue is there and it will hold your attention  the deserving production efforts include cinematography by tony pierce roberts  a veteran to the merchant ivory films  and music by stanislas syrewicz  with mood and tone reminiscent of composer zbignew priesner  of filmmaker krzysztof kieslowski  s trois couleurs  especially  bleu        this is a british film you just might not want to miss   br    br   emily watson

seems to tell the truth is rottentomatoes com  this film is awful  the plot is extremely lazy  it is not scary either  people out there who think that because it stars sarah michelle geller it is somehow like the grudge should forget about it  this film is more like dark water  except it is even more predictable and slow moving than it  i was extremely disappointed with this film  it didn  t scare me nor interest me either  let  s face it   this type of plot has been flogged to death at this stage e g  the dead trying to contact the living   dragonfly  what lies beneath  ghost story  dark water  darkness  the changeling etc etc  it seems to me that the only ones writing original horror films nowadays are the japanese and the koreans  the films that are coming out of hollywood  like this  are cynical exercises in money making without a shred of respect for the viewer  they  re just being churned out            angela  sandra bullock  is a computer expert but  being shy and somewhat of a recluse  she does all of her work from the confines of her condo  just as she is about to take a vacation in mexico  a co worker sends her a computer disc with disturbing information on it  angela agrees to meet with her fellow employee but he mysteriously dies in a plane crash  angela heads to mexico but takes the disc with her  while she is sunning on the beach  a terrific looking gentleman named jack  jeremy northam  makes overtures to her  she falls for them and the two end up on a boat to cozumel  however  jack works for the folks who generated the secret information on the disc and he is out to get it  even after angela escapes from his clutches and lands back in the usa  jack makes things difficult  he changes angela  s identity on every computer across the nation  making her lose her condo  her bank account  everything  can angela  a computer whiz  beat jack at his own game  this very exciting movie has many assets  first  bullock and northam are two very beautiful  interesting actors and their presence adds immediate captivation  the script is very clever and sure in its knowledge of the capabilities of computers and their relevance in today  s world  the costumes  sets  production  and direction of the movie are also quite wonderful  and  despite how it sounds  there is a great deal of exciting action as angela goes on the run to defeat her enemy  if you love thrillers without unnecessary bloodshed or violence  this is a great choice  it delivers twists and turns with great frequency  making it possible for the viewer to   net   a very good evening of entertainment             i rented the dvd in a video store  as an alternative to reading the report  but it  s pretty much just more terror tainment  br    br   while the film may present some info from the report in the drama  you  re taking the word of the producers   there  s no reference to the commission report anywhere in the film  not one  br    br   the acting  all around  is pretty bad   pretty much all of the stereotypes of   hot shot   bitchy foul mouthed government agents  each thinking they know more than everyone else  there may be some truth to it  but it really has a bad hollywood stereotype smell to it  br    br   imdb  s user community ratings   comments tend to be more right than wrong  and i have started to glance at the ratings before renting whenever i can  br    br   i wish i had on this one             look  this is a low budget horror film that suffers from all of the problems that go with low budget movies  but you must see this just to watch lisa erickson as julie  she is smokin   hot and a great little actress to boot  these types of horror movies often unearth a rare gem and the power gave us lisa erickson  nothing i enjoy more than sitting down in my studio apartment with a coke and putting in this film  my friends bob  bill and dennis agree   lisa is not only brilliant  she is a hottie  the movie itself often plods along and the rest of the actors are not very helpful in that regard  but as soon as lisa hits the screen  things really start hopping  the others are clearly not in her league  this is not the exorcist but as i said  if you want to see a fun little movie with a hot little actress  this is the one to see             it wasn  t until i looked at the trivia section that i found out that the original producer star of this movie tyrone power died during its making   this no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things   a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic   you know when you  ve been painting a wall until you  re completely bored   well that  s the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when they  re swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner  br    br   the plot centres on soloman the king of israel having an affair with the queen of sheeba and his people not being happy about it   you can  t really blame them since there  s few things more beautiful in the world than those israeli moteks   though the israeli women here all seem to look like cherie blair   modern day israel is also very cosmopolitan with the majority of israelis being born outside the country but would this have been true a couple of thousand years ago where everyone speaks in european and american accents  br    br   after much talking and a dance sequence that has to be seen to be believed   and no that  s not praise   we have a climax where the heavily outnumbered israelis have to defend themselves against a massed egyptian army who can  t read a map otherwise they would have known there was a canyon in front of them   this is what i don  t get   even though their blinded by the sun the egyptians spend ten minutes charging towards the israelis never ever realising they  re charging towards a gaping ravine   isn  t this somewhat illogical   it  s also something of a revealing error since the horses   chariots and men falling into the canyon are obviously miniature figures  br    br   anyway the film ends with soloman killing his treacherous brother and praising god for his victory   but who needs moshe dayan   arik sharon or god when you  ve got an idiotic enemy who can  t see a ravine in front of him or waves a sword like he paints a wall              i am a huge woody allen fan and so when i saw that this was playing at the cinema i couldn  t help myself  i wanted to see how allen would follow up his magnificent film match point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in g b   which is unique among allen  s work  along with what seems to be his new muse scarlett johanson  scoop is much lighter than mp and the humor is scoop  s most enjoyable aspect  the plot revolves around johanson  s character  a journalism student  who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave  she falls in love with a suspected serial killer  jackman  and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding  oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by allen  br    br   i must say that i thoroughly enjoyed johanson  s performance but i am a bit bias  i could watch a three hour film with johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted  she plays a ditsy  yappy  bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of allen  s stereotypical neurosis stricken character  she adds appropriate body language for comic effect  needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find johanson  s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus  br    br   allen is allen    he is still playing the same character much like chaplin and his little tramp character  something that occur in this film makes me wonder if i will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however  he is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late    br    br   jackman is also enjoyable as the suave  millionaire murder suspect  i cannot say that jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less  br    br   in terms of the plot i cannot help but feel that this is fresh    in fact it stinks of curse of the jade scorpion  johanson and allen are more detective like than anything  however i must applaud allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding hollywood version of this film  instead of everything being black and white  things are painted in shades of gray  being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt  though the plot seemed old woody still has a knack for one liners  i did find his allusions to his last film interesting    come for the humor  laugh and be merry  br    br   needless to say if you enjoy allen  s work watch it  if not watch something else               i rented this film because of my interest in american history  and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons  this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his   vision   into a major world religion  it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo  illinois  it portrays the trial of joseph smith  within the course of that trial  brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism  and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith  then smith is assassinated  and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land  despite his grave doubts  he perseveres  and finally has a vision  that utah is the place for his colony  that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership  later  as crops are destroyed by crickets  he again doubts that he has truly been chosen  however  a miracle occurs  which cements his place in history  br    br   i found the performances to be moving  and the story to be convincing and interesting  i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal  polygamy is a part of the story  but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised  the issue is not emphasized  br    br   i  m sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject matter  but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout                   s   frightmare   is an odd little film  the director seems to be trying to combine the atmosphere of classic     s     s style horror movies with the shock factor of the then exploding     s slasher genre  it isn  t totally successful  mostly due to very obvious budgetary restraints  and the less than professional caliber of its cast of young actors  but it still has its moments  mostly due to the classy performance  classier than the movie deserves  by the late german actor ferdinand mayne  who plays an aging old time horror movie star  ala vincent price  named   conrad ratzoff    at the beginning of the movie we meet the has been horror star as he  s shooting a commercial for dentures and we quickly learn that ol   conrad is a bit of a hoity toity  prima donna jerk off  just when you think he couldn  t be any more un likable  the commercial director berates conrad for blowing a take for the umpteenth time and the old goat pushes him off a balcony to his death  nice  huh  conrad then visits some fans at a college campus horror movie club  unfortunately he suffers a heart attack in the middle of his speech to them and eventually ends up back at his mansion waiting to die  still feisty even at death  s door  he manages to do away with a despised business associate by smothering him with a pillow before he finally kicks the bucket himself  conrad is then laid to rest in true hollywood style in a high tech neon tomb with video screens above the casket  which will play personal video messages from conrad himself for visitors who enter to pay their respects  br    br   it is at this point that the kids from the college horror movie society decide to pay conrad  s grave an after hours visit  breaking into the tomb and taking his body back home with them for an all night party   not exactly my idea of fun  but hey  these are characters in an     s horror film  logic has no place here   the college kids spend the evening having dinner with conrad  s body seated in a place of honor  posing for photos with it and even dancing around the room with it  before parking conrad and his coffin in the attic  planning to return him to his crypt in the morning  in the meantime  mrs  ratzoff  distraught over the theft of her husband  s body  has called in a psychic friend to try and   reach   conrad through a seance  you can pretty much figure out the rest from here  since conrad wasn  t a very nice guy in life  it  s not much of a stretch to assume that he won  t be any friendlier in death  psychic lady makes contact with conrad and he re awakens in predictably ticked off fashion  then spends the rest of the movie strolling around the corridors of the students   ridiculously huge house  picking off the young grave robbers one by one  this is where the movie falls apart  endless scenes of teens wandering around empty hallways saying   hello  is anyone there    are intercut with occasional bursts of violence  we do get a pretty gnarly decapitation scene  which is the highlight of the movie  before the last two survivors finally figure out  way later than any semi intelligent people would have figured out the same thing   but again  we  re in an     s horror film   that the only way to stop the mayhem is to get conrad  s body back to its crypt where it belongs  the sluggish pacing is padded out with a lot of weird lighting and dry ice fog effects backed by a soundtrack made up almost entirely of sound effects rather than music thunder  moans and groans  howls  etc   that becomes severely annoying after a while  br    br   i can  t really recommend   frightmare   to anyone who didn  t grow up watching cheap movies like this on late night cable back in the     s    modern horror   fans will doubtlessly find   frightmare   incredibly slow moving and goofy  if you came of age in that magical decade  however  you may get a blast of nostalgia from   frightmare    fans of jeffrey    re animator    combs may also want to check it out  as the future dr  west appears in an early role here as one of the unlucky film students  br    br   i will advise the reader to avoid the version of this film on the eastwestdvd label  paired with roy ward  s   vault of horror   and sold at dollar stores  because the print quality is terrible  i  m told the film has gotten a deluxe release via the fine folks at troma  which seems appropriate  if you  re a troma kind of person then   frightmare   will be right up your alley             people watch movies for a variety of different reasons  this movie didn  t have the big budget  there  s no special effects  no car chases and there  s no explosions  actually reality doesn  t have much of these either  at least not in my life   br    br   this is a very real movie about very real people  none of them perfect in any way but together they are put into a situation where they learn to explore and accept what is different and that in turn makes order out of chaos  i am not prepared to limit the possibility of parapsychology  since i  m neither an expert nor use the full extent of my own brain  br    br   so watch this movie for the characters  it is brim full of a whole cast of wonderful quirky folk   br    br   within the first three minutes kiefer sutherland enacts detective michael hayden  s life superbly and he keeps developing the character throughout the movie  excellent acting  very believable   br    br   henry czerny could not have been cast better and the rapport between his   harvey   and kiefer  s   mickey   enhances the oppositeness of their characters  br    br   i thoroughly enjoyed the cranky landlady    mrs ramsay    i  m sure she and my mother in law are good friends    br    br   there  s a host more of these wonderful characters but space is limited here so watch the movie and enjoy them             i think that you can not imagine how these people really work      before i came to the studios to watch the guys work there  i actually thought quite the same as you do  but since i saw and did the work the guys on that tv show have to do  i have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long  that really is no easy work  and also the actors  which in your eyes may be terribly bad  are really great people and a lot of them really can act  i don  t think that the material given to them can really show that  as i think this material isn  t very good  but they are truly good  so i don  t think that you  before you haven  t seen these guys doing there work  can judge over them  and i shouldn  t have judged over them as well before i met them  but i did and am now terribly ashamed of it  so please  do not allow yourself to judge over these great people unless you haven  t seen them doing there job             as usual  i am making a mad dash to see the movies i haven  t watched yet in anticipation of the oscars  i was really looking forward to seeing this movie as it seemed to be right up my alley  i can not for the life of me understand why this movie has gotten the buzz it has  there is no story   a group of guys meander around iraq  one day they are here diffusing a bomb  tomorrow they are tooling around the countryside  by themselves no less and start taking sniper fire  no wait here they are back in bagdad  there is no cohesive story at all  the three main characters are so overly characterized that they are mere caricatures  by that i mean  we have the sweet kid who is afraid of dying  we have the hardened military man who is practical and just wants to get back safe  and then we have the daredevil cowboy who doesn  t follow the rules but has a soft spot for the precocious little iraqi boy trying to sell soldiers dvds  what do you think is going to happen    well  do you think the cowboy soldier who doesn  t follow rules is going to get the sweet kid injured with his renegade ways   why yes  do you think the iraqi kid that cowboy soldier has a soft spot for is going to get killed and make him go crazy  why yes  there is no story here  the script is juvenile and predictable  the camera is shaken around a lot to make it look   artsy    and for all of you who think this is such a great war picture  go rent   full metal jacket      deerhunter   or   platoon    don  t waste time or money on this boring movie             a group of friends break down in the middle of nowhere  one had a flat tire  the other  s jeep mysteriously won  t start   one of them takes the tire to a run down service station and that is the last anyone sees of him  when the remaining foursome go in search of their friend  they come across nice mr  slaussen who offers to help fix the jeep and offers cool drinks and refuge from the heat in his equally run down  hermit like house  which happens to be occupied by very realistic looking mannequins  he goes with the one guy in the bunch out to work on the car and leaves the   girls in the house  before he goes he warns them not to leave and go up to the house behind his shack  he warns them about   davy    his brother who is lurking about and isn  t all there  of course  one of them decides to venture out in search of a working phone and is never seen again  is it slaussen  is it davy  the mannequins   tourist trap has the usual horror requirements  jiggly big boobed girl  goody two shoes girl  curiosity getting the better of people and never working out    but it stands apart from the rest of the     s genre in it  s twist of an ending  i started to feel sorry for slaussen  chuck conners is a terrific  creepy  over the top performance at a point in the film  and you almost see the character of molly doing the same  this is a gem if you can find it  i had taped it off of cable when i was younger  and walking through a used video store i spotted a vhs copy that was totally overpriced  but well worth it  fans of tanya roberts won  t be disappointed either  best part of the film for me was the scene with the soup  and crackers    br    br   i gave it a   because some of the movie was and still is hard to explain             most lorne michaels films seem to fail because they  re essentially just extended versions of skits that barely managed to make people laugh in five minute segments    tommy boy   is a character right from   snl     a big fat lovable  in their opinion  goof who doesn  t know anything  br    br   david spade gets the thankless overwhelmed everyman role  he  s paired with the annoying overweight slob and they endure miserable misfortunes as they travel cross country to save daddy  s business  br    br   the plot  for starters  is really faulty  the whole premise   daddy dies and rich stupid son has to save the family biz   can be traced back to just about any movie you want  like any snl style film it is reduced to a simple motivation   empty  shallow  just a reason to see a fat guy and a thin guy be   funny   together  br    br   the movie  s biggest   influence   is the      comedy classic   planes  trains   automobiles    that movie is great because the plot isn  t stale and recycled  it  s basic  yeah   a guy traveling home for thanksgiving gets stuck with a slob  but it  s real  dammit  it makes all the difference  the characters are real  the situations are far more real    tommy boy   is pure slapstick and its ridiculous situations undermine the characters   we feel nothing for them  and we don  t care about what  s happening on screen    pta   walked the careful line between outrageous and utterly believable and relate able     tommy boy   is simply absurd  with jokes like a simple deer in the headlights turning into a crash turning into a struggle with a dead deer that really isn  t dead  then awakens and wrecks their car  br    br   the whole wrecked car thing is stolen completely from   pta   and it  s eerie how much stuff in this film actually does resemble the steve martin john candy movie  br    br   farley is simply way too obnoxious to find likable   i  ve never enjoyed watching him in any movies and this hasn  t changed my mind  spade  s given very little to do  serving as the movie  s most thankless character  br    br   dan aykroyd is wasted as the evil baddie who plans to destroy daddy  s business  the ending is a joke  and not in a   har har funny   way  more like a   oh god are they serious     way  br    br   some people dig it  that  s cool  but i just can  t get into it  nor do i appreciate all the stuff it   borrows   from   not just counting   pt a     without any credit whatsoever             having read during many years about how great this film was  how it established ruiz among the french critics  specially the snobbish cahiers crowd   when i finally watched it about a year ago  i found it pretty disappointing  but then  i guess my expectations were sky high   shot in saturated black and white  this deliberately cerebral film  made for tv  and mercifully  only an hour long  is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings  which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants  and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime   the awful kate beckinsale film uncovered has a similar argument   borgesian is a word i read a lot in reviews about this movie  but i would say almost any borges story is more interesting than this film             many teenage sex comedy movies come and go without much fanfare  however  every so often a movie might come along thats honest  funny  entertaining and memorable  the last american virgin is a special movie that has found its place and has stood the test of time blending all four ingredients  this film follows three friends  gary  rick and david   the big apple    misadventures into the world of first time sex and true love  along the way they learn hard lessons and the value of true friendship  we follow hopeless romantic gary  the main character  on his quest to win over the girl of his dreams which leads him down an uncertain road with a surprise twist at it  s ending  if you haven  t been lucky enough to see this movie yet  by all means take a look   sprinkled with many memorable   s songs throughout the movie to keep things moving at an even pace  l a v  truly is an original film  a rarity among films of it  s genre             i loved this show from it  s first airing  and i always looked forward to watching each episode every week  the plot  characters  writing  special affects were outstanding  then the sci fi channel screwed up yet again and canceled a very entertaining  well written show  i say bring it back  i know all of the actors would come back  i would suggest buying the dvd  s  i am  i hope the sci fi channels executives get word of these comments  and realize that they need to be more involved with their viewers  i only watch one show on that channel now   ghost hunters   but i am fairly sure that shortly they will cancel that too             i didn  t know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much  don  t get my wrong its not a bad short film  tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film  you can tell that it has been an act of love for her  the acting  outside of dominic  is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good  there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on  though i don  t feel it greatly detracts for one  s ability to understand the film  if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do  i say go for it  the gag reel was fun  i won  t spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over  if you like the film then check out the pink mirror  a film also done by jagged edge  i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven             did the first travesty actually make money  this is another sequel  along the lines of another stakeout  that no one asked for  but we  ve received it anyway  the sequel is like its predecessor  completely brain dead  it  s also pretty disgusting  remember the dinner scene   to think i almost felt sorry for ritter  yasbeck  and warden  did they need the money that much             i was never so bored in my life  hours of pretentious  self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems  it  s like watching lizards molt  even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy  if you have insomnia  rent this             this movie is awesome on so many levels    and none of them are the level that it was intended to be awesome on  br    br   just remember this  when you  re watching shaun of the dead and other recent zombie movies    be they good or bad    this is the formula that they are using  this is what makes zombie movies so great  br    br   and what makes it better than great is the story behind the movie  a simple web search will provide you with everything you need to know  br    br   all in all  it doesn  t linger  there  s never a point where you think to yourself   c  mon  get on with it      it moves quick and corners nicely  this is the sporty  little italian number of zombie flicks  br    br   so awful  it  s wonderful  if your tongue spends an ample amount of time in your cheek    rent it  buy it  love it  br    br   as a great trivia note  if you  re watching it on dvd  you  ll notice that there is sound effects during the menu screen  underneath the musical score    well    that  s because that music was lifted straight from the trailer    which is probably the only working print of that music that still exists which is long enough to loop             the ladies man is laugh out loud funny  with a great diverse cast as well as having some very stupid but excellent scenes  including the funniest love song ever written   br    br   ferrell is his usual quality self in a brilliant side role  br    br   tim meadows plays an idiot surprisingly well and has written himself some of the funniest lines you  ll find in any comedy out there  br    br   it is definitely worth a purchase as watching it every   months or so will lead to you still laughing as hard as you did first time round  br    br   i am distraught to think at the time of writing this that it has a meagre         and i urge you to vote   br    br   and remember kids    theres more motion in the ocean              when i first heard about this movie i thought it would be like the duchess        but when i saw the first    minutes of the young victoria i knew this wouldn  t just be a solid movie  almost everything in this movie is great  the costumes are really amazing and the settings are also beautifully shot  br    br   the only thing that really let me down are the performances  emily blunt the devil wears prada  is the star of the film  bringing victoria to life and with this movie she shows that she is a great actress and maybe picking a first oscar nomination for her performance  rupert friend is almost bland as prince albert but he has great chemistry with emily blunt  paul bettany is also solid as lord melbourne although i expected more of him  jim broadbent and miranda richardson both have supporting roles but are forgettable  br    br   to me the film feels like unfinished  maybe that the screenwriters changed too many things in the script  i don  t know but that  s how i feel about the movie  br    br   but overall it  s a great movie about the early years of victoria with a great performance from emily blunt             a flying saucer manned  literally  by a crew of about    male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some    years ago on a   forbidden planet    what they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth  a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman  and her father  a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself in  br    br   on the surface  this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery  some compare it to shakespeare  s tempest  but this is a stretch  and  in some ways  an insult to the scifi genre  stripped of what makes it a scifi film  sure  its the tempest  but how many hundreds of films can you say something similar about   br    br   underneath  this is a cautionary tale about progress and technology and the social evolution necessary for its appropriate and safe use  yet the film still proceeds with all the hopefulness for our future that we have come to expect from shows like star trek  br    br   anne francis is not the only reason why this film is best described as beautiful  the special effects  and even the aesthetics of the backdrops are powerful enough to make the uninspired directing and uneven acting almost unnoticeable  if it were not for the goofy retro art deco ness of     s sci fi props  you might think you were watching a     s piece  br    br   this is a classic of that very special sub genre of sci fi i like to call     s sci fi  and  though not  in my opinion  the best it is certainly a must see for anybody interested in sci fi film and special effects  the clever plot  now rendered trite by its reuse in six or seven episodes of star trek  lost in space  and even farscape  is worth paying attention to  and will sustain the interest of most scifi fans  trekkers will be particularly interested in the various aspects of the film which seem to have inspired themes of star trek  s original series aired about    years later  though they may find themselves disappointed by the  relatively mild      s sexism and the lack of any kind of racial integration  while i do not mean to nitpick  the lack of social progress manifest in this film was the one major problem i had with it   br    br   some will probably see this film simply to catch a glimpse of young  good looking leslie nielsen in one of his first starring roles  unfortunately  nielsen  s performance is only average  and at times down right poor  especially at the climax of the film   walter pigeon  though quite excellent in other films  over acts his role as well  ms francis  earl holliman  and the amazing robby the robot are the stand out actors in this crowd  though on the whole the character actors filling in the ensemble do a good job  the problems with the featured performances  i think  are as much the fault of the director and the editor  as anything  though they certainly got most of the film quite right             i just saw this film on dvd last night  and decided to check out the reviews this morning  it seems that   i  robot   has polarized the critical viewing community here on imdb  and given rise to a lot of insults and name calling  too   br    br   i find this somewhat surprising  as this film is not great  or even good   but neither is it terrible  or even really bad   what this film really is  is   depressing  depressing that the us film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid  clich  d re heats  and acclaim them as spectacular new works  this film as   retread   written all over it  from the plot line  an uneasy mix of asimov and modern day uber action  to smith  s character  a smart mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium   to the special effects  that borrowed from matrix and a few others   br    br     i  robot   is  sadly  quite possibly the perfect action movie for today  s audience  superficial plot  insipidly snappy dialog  and lots and lots of adrenaline  smith is mediocre  but we already knew that  he seems to be hollywood  s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black bruce willis   the story has lots of holes in it  of all sizes  but i don  t think most people drawn to this film are critically minded enough to notice  perhaps a blockbuster by today  s standards  but very b movie compared to true winners             this was a fine example of how an interesting film can be made without using big stars and big effects  just tell a true story about the struggles of two african american women over a turbulent century  br    br   this movie challenges us all to look at our own personal prejudices and see that people are people  not white  black  etc  br    br   good movie with a good message             i have bought the complete season of surface  watched it in   days  i was so captured by the the plot  theories and basically everything about this show  the actor who plays miles is great  mile  s sister  mother and father acted like real life family would  you could connect on so many levels it  s fascinating  br    br   i find animals are so wonderful  you can almost connect with them as a parent is to a child  it would be something if a creature of this sort of nature truly exists  br    br   am sadden  that surface is not having a second season or at least four more shows  i have so many questions that need to be answered and hopefully maybe they will create more or maybe in a book  br    br   love the show very much  for those who haven  t watched surface  if you like sci fi you need to watch this                         this must have been one of the worst movies i have ever seen  br    br   i have to disagree with another commenter  who said the special effects were okay  i found them pretty bad  it just wasn  t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story  br    br   maybe that distraction is the reason that i did not fully understand the story  the archaeologists are looking for   the set    they do not bother to tell what set  or what is so special about it  that also makes it unclear why they search for it in california  while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient egypt  br    br   if you  re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert  take the effort to actually go to the desert  the beginning   the ancient ceremony   looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert  br    br   the action level was constant throughout the movie  no ups and downs  no climax  it made the movie look short  and that  s certainly a pro for this particular movie             liam neeson portrays the scottish legend robert roy macgregor from the early   th century  he is a true actor  he captivates the audience with his charisma as he does in all his roles  jessica lange is excellent as his wife mary  mary is such a beautiful woman  it  s her love that makes rob roy the legend  but it  s his passion that makes her love undying  they need each other  tim roth as the evil cunningham is perfect  in one way or another  upon watching the movie  you will find cunningham disgusting  the scotland scenery is beautiful  the environment and conditions of the times are depicted quite well  if you like history  romance  passion and love  you  ll enjoy rob roy  there is violence and blood  but it  s unavoidable in telling this story as it should be told  no gratuitous violence  and you do have to listen carefully if you  re not used to a scottish accent  one important point that makes this movie so good is that no one actor or actress is glamorized  they get dirty and actually look unattractive in various scenes  it  s their skill as actors that attracts you  they don  t rely on marquee names  popularity or sex symbol appeal  this is something special             when i watch this movie i too get excited when seen bed scenes of miss world  she has beautiful and charming body  when cute lady do bed scenes and show her fully nude body    i think male have hard to resist    i think its time for cute girls like hrishita bhatt also do nude scenes  at least no one wants to c nude body of ugly women like seema biswas to c in bandit queen i concur with what mallicka b has said  the movie is portrayed in a way which appears to be a kind of vilification on the original content  emotions aren  t conveyed properly  i guess a couple of not so good performances also contributed to its mediocrity  in my view  tabu would have been a much better choice for such a role instead of aishwarya rai  in some of her scenes  she looks a bit lusty  which is not ultimately what the movie should have portrayed  i also noticed a bit of over acting in some of her scenes  i  m a bitter critic of aishwarya rai    can  t help it  sorry for that    raincoat   was a good movie by rituparno ghosh  and i saw choker bali after seeing raincoat  i was not at all impressed           they ve shown i twice in a very short time now here in sweden and i am so very tired of it  the bad acting isn t enough    the story itself is so boring and the effects hardly exists  i love the original from      so i recommend you to go and rent that one instead  because this one is such a bore            having seen carlo lizzani  s documentary on luchino visconti  i was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by adam low  but the viewer like me did get dissatisfied    i faced a need for critical opinion  which i generally don  t like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer  there are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally  but when i read the reviews already written on this title  i also felt a bit confused  people sometimes don  t know what to criticize  therefore  to be clear  i  ll divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably  the former one about visconti before his director  s career and latter one about visconti the director   br    br   the aristocratic background  all the hobbies  the wealth that young luchino experienced and enjoyed are clearly presented  his effort in horse racing is mentioned as well as his relation with his mother so much disturbed after his parents   divorce  we also get a very accurate idea of where luchino was brought up as a real count of milano  in riches galore  with nannies  cooks with access to everything  in true aristocracy  for instance  his father  s splendid villa at grazzano and other marvelous villas prove that  there is also an emphasis on visconti  s crucial visit in paris in the     s where he met eminent people    left wingers    who later had impact on his style and message in art  that clearly explains the idea of a communist with the aristocratic upbringing  a contrast at first sight    br    br   however  the part about his director  s career  which started with ossessione during wwii and ended with innocente just before the director  s death in       is poorly executed  his movies are not discussed well  why  because there are very few people who really have something to say  franco zeffirelli  the director  remembers the works on la terra trema and that is all right  there are also some interviews with franco rosi  but later  such movies like il gattopardo  la caduta dei rei  la morte a venezia or ludwig are mostly discussed by helmut berger  although i liked the actor in the role of ludwig  i did not like the interviews of his  moreover  some thoughts he reveals are not accurate to entail in such a documentary    there is no mention of significant works of visconti like conversation piece  there are no interviews with eminent cast burt lancaster  a mention about silvana mangano and romy schneider should also be made  there is one footage interview with maria callas that appears to be interesting but that is only a short bit  franco zeffirelli  though i appreciate him as a director  makes fun of it all rather than says something really precious  for instance  he mentions the event how visconti separated from him after years of service  therefore  i say  simplified and unsatisfactory   br    br   what i find a strong point here are footage interviews with visconti himself  as a result  we may get his own opinion about his works  for instance  i very much appreciate the words he says about death regarding it as a normal chapter of life and as natural as birth itself  he also discusses his health problems after the stroke while filming ludwig  br    br   i believe it is better to see luchino visconti        by carlo lizzani than this doc  although it is shorter and condensed as a whole  you will get a better idea of the director  visconti would be furious about that and the fury of his usually turned people  s emotions and viewpoints into stone                    time is precious  this film isn  t  i must learn to ignore critics who rave about small films like fargo and this complete waste of time  br    br   the theater was packed and everyone left with the same reaction  is this the film the critics are raving about  what a piece of crap  br    br   the hook of this film is the upwardly mobile black daughter seeking out and finding her white trash family  get it  br    br   the acting is superb  br    br   the production  lighting  sets  editing  sound  is about   steps above a    minutes story  the characters are shallow and unintelligent  i was insulted by the fact that these people could not figure out about each other what was blatantly obvious to the audience  the audience was murmuring to the movie screen what the characters should say next  br    br   i have had more fun doing the laundry             worst  movie  ever made  ever  i have no words to say about it   other then it truly had no point  no plot  no    anything  sheer crap    i don  t know how everyone in the movie didn  t shoot them shelves after watching it                      i love vampire flicks and mysteries  and alternate abstract outside the box films  and     this was non of those  i mean what the crap    i cant even tell you what the film was about cuz i still don  t know  and i just wasted an hour and ahalf of my life watching it    bottom line   i think the maker of this film just wants everyone to do drugs  thats the only thing i got from this film  please don  t watch this    i mean for a    sultry sensual vampire flick   there wasn  t even the to be expected nudity you  d get from a vamp flick  anyway back to my point     this movie blows  go set yourself on fire instead                      savage island        is a lame movie  it  s more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting  not only that the storyline and script was wretched  i don  t know why this movie was made  i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry  this one made my blood boil  the situations were inane at best  if i made a movie like this it would have been a short  really because those backwood   idjits   wouldn  t have been in the picture  br    br   don  t be fooled by the cover on the d v d  i am an avid watcher of bad cinema  but this movie is virtually unwatchable  i don  t mind movies being shot on d v  but if you  re going to do that make the movie enjoyable  not some tired retread of superior horror films  sans wrong turn   br    br   i have to not recommend this waste of disk  if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by  br    br   movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic              i have to say this is my favorite movie of all time  i have seen it well over     times  actually had to buy a new copy as a result of overwatching  it is what the eighties was like and what a romantic story with a few morals thrown in  i highly recommend to anyone wanting to relive the high schools days again  buy a copy now it is a classic               i saw it at the legacy theater in the joseph smith memorial building in salt lake city this morning  i  m going to assume that one  s level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one  s level of acceptance of joseph  s story  br    br   however  that aside it was very well made  well acted  and had a nice score  if you get to salt lake city  it is a must to see it in the legacy theater  i have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality  sound quality and ambiance in my entire life   i wonder if the church would let me watch batman begins there  being that i  m lds and regard joseph as a prophet  i was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times   which i presume is expected since they handed out tissues before the movie started  anyway  i  m told that this film is available in several lds visitor centers around the globe  if you have    minutes check it out because whether you believe joseph smith or not  he tells a fascinating story             adenoid hynkel  a lowly soldier in world war one  rises in subsequent years to become the ruthless dictator of toumania  he creates an aggressive  antisemitic war machine and cultivates a little toothbrush moustache  sound like anyone you know  br    br   from the safety of hollywood  chaplin uses this soapbox to exhort europe to take up arms and defy hitler and mussolini  given that the united states in      had more than a year of neutrality ahead of it  and no strong desire to embroil itself in europe  s civil strife  remember  it was hitler who declared war on the usa  not the other way round  it is surprising that chaplin was allowed to distribute this immoderate polemic  br    br   the story involves on the one hand the the vulgar and repellant hynkel and the reign of terror over which he ineptly presides  and life in the jewish ghetto where every single person is friendly  humane  brave  etc   etc  chaplin is hynkel  and he also plays the jewish barber  the little hero of the ghetto  the tramp in all but name   needless to say  chaplin writes  directs  stars  composes the music and does the catering  br    br   in      the full truth was not yet known about the third reich  and chaplin can be forgiven for having something less than perfect historical foresight  but even by the standards of the day he gets hitler badly wrong  a comedian and a sentimentalist  chaplin tries to ridicule hitler by making hynkel silly and hapless  all this does is to humanise him  when hynkel the not very warlike soldier fools around with the big gun and the upside down aeroplane  he becomes endearing rather than despicable  as dictator  he inspects his subordinates   technical innovations which don  t work  the parachute hat  the bulletproof uniform etc   and these passages are meant to make us think that the real life nazis are incompetent and can be swept aside  in fact  hynkel  s regime is made cute and likeable by its bumbling bodgery  br    br   in truth  chaplin  s day had already passed when he made this ill considered polemic  at heart  he was still a dinosaur of the silent screen  check out the humour  with gags like staggering up and down the street semi conscious  or the pantomime of the coins in the puddings   the hero schultz is meant to represent a yardstick of european decency against which hynkel can be judged  but schultz looks more like a character from operetta than a nazi  is it in any way believable that a schultz figure  if such had existed  would say to the fuehrer  s face    your cause is doomed to failure because it  s built upon the stupid  ruthless persecution of innocent people    and how does schultz come to be in the cellars of the jewish ghetto  if he is the object of an exhaustive manhunt  why does he persist in wearing his ruritanian uniform  chaplin did not yet know the full horrors of auschwitz birkenau or treblinka  but the nazi concentration camp which he offers us is hopelessly out of kilter with the grim spirit of the age  as usual  chaplin thinks in terms of   silent   comedy set pieces  loosely pegged onto the narrative clothes line  there is the knockabout scrapping with the stormtroopers  shaving a man to the accompaniment of brahms  and the globe ballet  watch for the segment filmed in reverse   br    br   paulette goddard is the unremittingly perfect hannah  just as the people of the ghetto are impossibly nice  and the jewish haven in osterlich is ridiculously idyllic  so hannah is quite literally too good to be true  brave  defiant  resourceful  hardworking and  of course  beautiful  she is the canary of judaism in the ghetto cage    gee  ain  t i cute    she asks  after the barber gives her a make over  too cute by far  is the answer  she doesn  t come close to ringing true  because chaplin has made her a caricature  the   wouldn  t it be wonderful    speech which chaplin puts into her mouth is typical of the author   too wordy  too emotionally cloying  br    br   jack oakie is great as napaloni  the fascist dictator of bacteria  he brings a whiff of much needed comic brio to the proceedings  but the film  s underlying weakness remains  if napaloni is silly and ineffective  how can we fear him  and anyway  the stuttering stop start of the back projected train is a fine chaplinesque example of a gag that is persisted with far beyond its comic worth  br    br   and where did the jewish barber acquire that immaculate hynkel uniform               milo   is yet another answer to a question nobody ever asked do we really need more slashers i for one think we already have more than enough i guess the professional tall guys overcharged so in this one we deal with a murderous kid that  s also a zombie or a ghost when he feels like it a long time ago he drowned but that didn  t bother him and he still kills people   friday the   th   what  s that   one day his survivors have a big reunion and as a surprise twist milo comes to pay them a visit through some really bad shots that show everything except the murders the cast is thinned out till only the final girl is left to find out milo  s dull i mean dark secret she and her friends have been dying to know once discovered milo goes on yet another murderous rampage isn  t it his bedtime yet   and the girl well she screams a lot the acting is not even bottom of the barrel the barrel refuses to be associated with it milo can be one creepy bastard from time to time i give him that but some movies just can  t be saved without a great script or gratuitous nudity             this is one of the best horror   suspense films that hollywood has made in years or maybe even decades even though in my opinion this movie was predictable in parts  it has everything that a good film in this genre should had chill  thrills  and yes a lot of gore   house of wax sure delivers    in parts it was sort of far fetched the acting was not that great but my overhaul rating for house of wax is an eight out of ten      if you enjoy being at the edge of your seats  this is just the right movie for you i have to admit it was sort of neat seeing the whole town made out of wax       i myself enjoy these museums  but after seeing this film i will now look at them in a whole new different way             never saw the original movie in the series   i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the       s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified  this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now  anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie  it was  however  a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark  really  this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen  the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm  other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid  the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water  not really worth watching i would however like to see the original  granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the     s  but he also made a very good slasher movie in the     s   the town the dreaded sundown               created in       and originally named mortimer before walt disney changed his name  because his wife convinced him   mickey mouse has become the staple of the disney brand  i always thought this cartoon was the first ever cartoon to feature mickey  it is in fact his third  but it doesn  t matter  for a six minute animated short it is enjoyable  the story sees mickey piloting a steamboat until captain pete takes him off the bridge  stopping to pick up cargo  and minnie mouse missing the boat  being lifted on she drops her music sheets and a goat eats them  mickey helps her crank it  s tail and play the tune  and getting some other animals to be percussion  until pete comes along again to stop him  making mickey peel potatoes  mickey mouse was number    on the     greatest pop culture icons  and he was number    on the     greatest cartoons  very good             highly regarded at release  but since rather neglected  immense importance in the history of performing arts  a classic use of embedded plots  one of my favourite films  why hasn  t the soundtrack been re released             the perfect murder is foiled when a wife played by mary ellen trainor  once the wife to director robert zemeckis  who helmed this episode   who murders her husband with a poker  has the misfortune of receiving a visitor as she is about to move the body outside  an escaped insane madman dressed in a santa claus suit played by a deviously hideous larry drake   she fends for her life while trying to find a way of hiding her husband  s corpse  she decides to use an ax  once she downs the santa killer who misses several chances to chop off the woman  s head  to frame the killer for her husband  s murder  santa killer locks her in a closet and pursues the woman  s daughter as she tries desperate to free herself to save the child  br    br   this episode of tales from the crypt just recycles tired material involving the old   santa kills   theme while also adding the oft used add nauseum woman murders her husband for a man she  s been cheating with routine  it  s essentially trainor trying to find a way to avoid being caught with a dead body she kills while also keeping a safe distance from a maniac  there  s nothing refreshing or new about this plot which pretty much goes through the motions  not one of the show  s highlights             the imdb plot summary in no way describes the essence of this film  it should have read   be prepared to be catapulted back to the prison of the  rd pew from the back of your family  s church at   years old  listening to the preacher drone on about god  s will while all you can think of is getting back home to your lego    br    br   it starts off well intentioned  building intrigue by planting some real and surreal clues such as renny  s   how did the cut on my thumb heal so fast    moment  it then slowly morphs into a christian jamboree  sacrificing its plot completely in a wash of evangelistic induced babble  i believe i counted the use of the word   pray   about    times in a five minute span near the end  after the   st  i tried to twist the context of the word to its synonym    prey    sadly  this little mind game of mine made the film at least bearable for the last    minutes  plus it made me laugh whenever a character would say   prayer      preyer   to me  as it became totally zany  indeed  even my catholic wife sunk in her chair from boredom  almost to the point of ending up on the floor  br    br   for all the salivating christians who ranked this film      stars  i suggest sticking with your theology reinforcing safety standards like circle square  the ten commandments  anything from narnia  jesus christ superstar and the like  stay away from more cerebrally challenging subject matter in films such as jesus camp  the god who wasn  t there  what would jesus buy  or the soon to be released religulous  br    br   maybe robert whitlow  s book is better             tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford  s films  at two hours  it was quite long for a      silent film yet continues to hold your interest some    years after it was filmed  mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a   greatest hits   performance with bits of mary the innocent  mary the little devil  mary the little mother  mary the spitfire  mary the romantic heroine  etc  characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past  the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character  s illegitimate child for      and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question  if the academy awards had been around in       no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary  s             i first saw this movie when i was about    years old  my mom bought it at our local kmart because it was on sale for    on vhs  she thought that it would be a nice christmas movie for me and my brothers to watch  this movie  however  scared the hell out of me  you may be asking yourself  how could a movie about santa clause scare anyone  the plot of the movie revolves around satan sending one his minions  pitch  to earth in an attempt to kill santa and ruin christmas  that  s right  satan sends a demon up from hell to kill santa clause  pitch stalks santa throughout christmas eve in an attempt to trap him on earth when the sun rises on christmas day  for if santa doesn  t make it back to his home in space  he turns to powder  don  t get me wrong  the movie is funny and fairly entertaining  however  the image of demons and devils dancing in the depths of hell  which occurs at the beginning of the movie  is just downright creepy             although there are some snippets in this   part documentary hinting at the necessity for recreational drug law reform  these are not very well developed  in contrast to the many snippets from those who feel that the drugs that happen to currently be illegal are a scourge for which the only imaginable solution is incarceration of even those who are guilty even of mere possession of such drugs  br    br   although this program  as a whole  leaves the viewer with the impression that the drug war is largely a futile exercise and a waste of money  and for that it deserves some praise  almost nothing in this documentary addresses the very real problems that total war against those who merely possess illegal drugs obviously causes and contributes to  very real problems that most drug warriors themselves would tell you  if asked  they think the drug war is designed to solve  for example  while many minutes are spent on the surge in violence associated with the rising popularity of crack cocaine in the     s  at no point does this program even hint that the very laws designed to suppress crack cocaine make it impossible for drug sellers to enforce their contracts and business arrangements in courts of law  forcing them to resort to violence to stay in business  but instead of seeing the laws as an important cause of the violence  the drugs themselves seem to take the brunt of the blame  inexplicably  alcohol prohibition  the violence that ensued  and the subsequent reversal of prohibition  is totally ignored by this program  br    br   this program will help to perpetuate ridiculous stereotypes of drug users  and it is these that are the primary force in driving the very expensive and very problematic drug war  the possibility of incorporating drugs other than alcohol into a happy and successful life is not really touched on  use of any drug in excess is probably going to cause personal problems  but not all users do their drugs in excess  just like not all alcohol users are alcoholics  br    br   if you want a point of view from someone who believes that adults have a moral right not to be incarcerated and have their lives ruined by the criminal justice system just for using drugs that the government  for mostly very arbitrary political reasons rather than reasons based on sound social policy and legitimate science  has decided to totally prohibit  whose users it has decided to not so metaphorically wage war against  just forget about it  none of that is in here  br    br   on the other hand  this is hardly in the category of anti drug propaganda  it is mostly an interesting neutrally presented history of drugs in   th century united states like marijuana  lsd  heroin  cocaine  mdma  and oxycontin  but there is a significant element of various people  s points of view with regard to drug laws  and most  but not all  of that is not very thoughtful or well informed and slanted in favor of the drug warrior mentality  especially with respect to drugs other than marijuana   br    br   the criminal justice system  along with its often harsh life ruining penalties  is obviously not the only answer or the most appropriate answer to every single social problem  but unfortunately there  s an epidemic in this nation of an as yet unnamed disease whose primary symptoms are a lack of imagination with respect to social policy when it comes to certain drugs  a lack of compassion for fellow humans  a prejudice against people who use the drugs that are not governmentally approved  perhaps a vested interest in the growth of the prison policing industry  and a horrid apathy with regard to human dignity  it  s morally wrong to kidnap or incarcerate people unless you have a very damn good reason for doing so  and the mere possession of an arbitrarily selected group of drugs is clearly not such a reason  this is really the primary issue when it comes to drugs  yet this program ignores it  br    br   so  in sum  the parts of this program that neutrally present history without feeding stereotypes of drug users that are at the heart of the drug war mentality are pretty good and interesting and entertaining  but when it comes to presenting a rational non radical point of view with regard to drug policy  and giving the viewer examples not only of people with drug problems but also the many people who successfully incorporate drugs into happy and successful lives  it  s pretty disappointing             considering this film was released   years before i was born  i don  t feel too bad for over looking it for such a long time  back in january of    though  i attended the second annual quentin tarantino film fest held in austin texas  the particular theme of films this night was   neglected     s crime films   and boy was her right    the gravy train or the dion brothers  as it appeared this print    was an absolute gem  wonderful performances  quirky characters  smart plot  hilarious comedy  and just an all around great time  rarely do you see a crime film that is so entertaining and fresh  margot kidder in one of her earliest film appearances is extremely sexy as well  i hope some cable network gets a hold of this film and allows many more to see it  in the meantime  go to an indie video store and hope they have it             the movie was actually a romantic drama based on three sisters who had desires to become a famous girl group  in their endeavors  the oldest sister meets a drug dealer and street hustler called satin  whom sister goes after because she believes he is the   big time   who will give her everything she ever thought she wanted out of life  though he could be accused of killing her  he really kills only her spirit and will to live  after which she becomes a drug addict and ultimately dies from an overdose  the story isn  t about the street life or the italian mobster who tries to buy stix off  then threatens him  it  s about how love can overcome even the worst tragedies in life as portrayed in song and style and the character that was the life in the times for young women trying to be   discovered   back then             first  i realize that a       rating is supposed to be reserved for the worst of the worst  this movie gets that from me because  as one reviewer points out  it  s not bad in a self aware  over the top sort of way that might allow it to have some comic or cult value  it simply misses its mark on every count    contains possible spoilers   the dialog is completely disingenuous  the continuity is so deliberate it  s painful  daniel just finishes speaking of his lost love  and with his final word the flamenco dancers start  the mock shock of what  s her name  see  i don  t even remember her character  s name  let alone the name of the forgettable actress  when her husband  the baldwin  first tells her that her friend is the bad guy  the car and the motorcycle chases did all the right things  vegetable carts gone flying  cars crashing into each other  motorcycles going down the stairs  people nearly being hit  but remarkably  no one is  oh  that  s right    except for the one guy who has been stabbed several times  is obviously stumbling along the curb with knife wounds  and an approaching car apparently didn  t notice him there  hmmm   br    br   it  s becoming more and more remarkable to me that movies like this can be made  there is so much pressure in the film industry to make money  you  d think that someone in hollywood would think of making good films worth seeing  now there  s a novel idea   br    br   my suggestion  don  t see this film  don  t rent the dvd  don  t watch it on cable  there are lots of other things you could be doing that will leave you feeling more satisfied             picture the scene where a bunch of scriptwriters sit around a table and one says   lets have a black woman approach an unsuspecting member of the public  also black  in the street and ask him if he is black  then walk away    the other writers fall about laughing hysterically until one suggests they repeat it in every episode  more laughter  now if you think the premise is funny  and the show contains many such types of situation  you will enjoy this show  for the rest  use your zapper and find something more entertaining like watching paint dry  those that have written glowing reports of this show should either get out more or be forced to watch television comedies that are really funny  another example of the humor in the show  a girl tries to get out of paying at a supermarket checkout by trying to hypnotise the cashier  marginally funny the first time but why repeat it over and over in different shows with different cashiers  i could give other examples but these just might be treated as spoilers  divulging why this comedy just is not funny at all             the year      saw no fewer than   filmed productions of h  g  wells   great novel    war of the worlds    this is perhaps the least well known and very probably the best of them  no other version of wotw has ever attempted not only to present the story very much as wells wrote it  but also to create the atmosphere of the time in which it was supposed to take place  the last year of the   th century          using wells   original setting  in and near woking  england  br    br   imdb seems unfriendly to what they regard as   spoilers    that might apply with some films  where the ending might actually be a surprise  but with regard to one of the most famous novels in the world  it seems positively silly  i have no sympathy for people who have neglected to read one of the seminal works in english literature  so let  s get right to the chase  the aliens are destroyed through catching an earth disease  against which they have no immunity  if that  s a spoiler  so be it  after a book and   other films  including the      classic   you ought to know how this ends  br    br   this film  which follows wells   plot in the main  is also very cleverly presented    in a way that might put many viewers off due to their ignorance of late   th early   th century photography  although filmed in a widescreen aspect  the film goes to some lengths to give an impression of contemporaneity  the general coloration of skin and clothes display a sepia tint often found in old photographs  rather than black   colors are often reminiscent of hand tinting  at other times  colors are washed out  these variations are typical of early films  which didn  t use standardized celluloid stock and therefore presented a good many changes in print quality  even going from black white to sepia white to blue white to reddish white and so on    as you  ll see on occasion here  the special effects are deliberately retrograde  of a sort seen even as late as the     s    and yet the martians and their machines are very much as wells described them and have a more nearly realistic   feel    some of effects are really awkward    such as the destruction of big ben  the acting is often more in the style of that period than ours  some aspects of victorian dress may appear odd  particularly the use of pomade or brilliantine on head and facial hair  br    br   this film is the only one that follows with some closeness wells   original narrative    as has been noted  viewers may find it informative to note plot details that appear here that are occasionally retained in other versions of the story  wells   description of the martians    a giant head mounted on numerous tentacles    is effectively portrayed  when the martian machines appear  about an hour into the film  they too give a good impression of how wells described them  both wells and this film do an excellent job of portraying the progress of the martians from the limited perspective  primarily  of rural england    plus a few scenes in london  involving the narrator  s brother   the director is unable to resist showing the destruction of a major landmark  big ben   but at least doesn  t dwell unduly on the devastation of london  br    br   the victory of the martians is hardly a surprise  despite the destruction by cannon of some of their machines  the narrator  traveling about to seek escape  sees much of what wells terms   the rout of mankind    he encounters a curate endowed with the victorian affliction of a much too precious and nervous personality  they eventually find themselves on the very edge of a martian nest  where they discover an awful fact  the martians are shown to be vampires who consume their prey alive in a very effective scene  wells adds that after eating they set up   a prolonged and cheerful hooting    the narrator finally is obliged to beat senseless the increasingly hysterical curate    who revives just as the martians drag him off to the larder  cheers from the gallery  british curates are so often utterly insufferable   br    br   this film lasts almost   hours  going through wells   story in welcome detail  it  s about time the author got his due    in a compelling presentation that builds in dramatic impact  a word about the acting  don  t expect award winning performances  they  re not bad  however  the actors are earnest and they grow on you  most of them  however  have had very abbreviated film careers  often only in this film  the narrator is played by hunky anthony piana  in his  nd film  the curate is john kaufman    also in his  nd film as an actor but who has had more experience directing  the brother    henderson    is played with some conviction by w  bernard bauman in his first film  the artilleryman  the only other sizable part  is played by james lathrop in his first film  br    br   this is overall a splendid film  portraying for the first time the war of the worlds as wells wrote it  despite its slight defects  it is far and away better than any of its hyped up competitors  if you want to see h  g  wells   war of the worlds    and not some wholly distorted version of it    see this film             of the elements that make this the best at this point  i have to say    is christine mcintire  shemp  s scene when poisoned and her reaction are truly magnificent  i imagine that  as one poster suggested  christine was trying to hold back laughter during that scene  but it actually made her seem even more deliciously evil  to be smiling at shemp  s possibly dying  br    br   another character who helps this stand out is the goon  his look was a great cross between horrific and comedic goof ball  hardly a character i would choose to meet in a dark alley or  for that matter anywhere  i would have preferred a bit of true whodunit mystery in this  but hey  when a short is this good  who  s going to complain  not i             okay this is stupid they say their not making another nightmare film that this is the   last   one   and what do they do they go on making another one not that the next one  part   was bad but why do they play us  anyway this movie made no sense what so ever it was extremelly dull the characters were highly one dimensional freddy was another joker which is very stupid for such a good series the plot is very very bad and this is even worse than part   and    i didnt get the movie its a stupid tale in   d pointless id say  i hated this film so much i still rmember all the parts i didnt like which was basically the whole film this is so different than the prequels it tries and tries but this one tried the hardest and got slapped back on the face again there were hadly any death scenes although they were different they sucked bigtime  how can they have gone this far didnt they see they made the biggest mistakes at parts   and   yet they make this its all bout the money do not see this sad excuse for a nightmare series  br    br   i gave a nightmare on elm street six       out of     br    br   good points of movie  had potential with plot  br    br   bad points of film  terrible acting lack of deaths too funny to be classified as horror very confusing             everyone  my name may sound weird  but there was nothing else   br    br   any way  i haven  t seen anything like this before so it was crazy  of course that  s a good thing  it is a humorously interesting movie and my absolute all time favourite thing is how they intertwine other things into one  like chicken little   the fish pretending to be king kong and runt the pig saying    twas beauty who killed the beast    war of the worlds scene and more  walt disney company has not lost his touch maybe not for this one  also  how they made it like they were watching a movie and it was like a home cinema   br    br   however some parts don  t fit  like in the original lion king  weren  t timon and pumbaa with simba when he beat scar  in this movie  they are not  they were fighting the hyenas backstage  ther  s more  the reason being why pumbaa isn  t so confident is because he was pushed away by the other animals and also  it  s just timon  timon  timon  anybody realise that only timonn  s story was told  whereas pumbaa only had flashbacks  br    br   but apart from that   it  s great             finally was there released a good modesty blaise movie  which not only tells a story  but actually tells the   real   story  i admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller  but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations  then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by peter o  donnell  you have a cover story just to tell about how modesty became the magnificent person which she is  it is not a movie to attract new fans  but a movie to tell the real tale  some things could have been better  but when you cannot forget the awful movie from      then is this a magnificent movie  so are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make modesty tell her story             by now  the game  s stale  right  br    br   the jokes have been done  its all over  the creative genius which drove this game for the first two games was gone  after all  br    br   wrong  br    br   the game is still intact  the jokes are here  folks  sure  they  re all rehash  but so was monkey island    and    for that matter  br    br   the difficulty is well placed  somewhere between the slightly easy   and the ridiculously hard    the ship fighting sub game is badly innappropriate  in the tradition of sub games  and this game has the best joke of the whole series  when asked for your membership card to an exclusive beach  always select   you don  t need to see my identification    its worth the price of the game by itself             i decided to watch this movie because i  d not seen carol lombard before in any movie  i  m sorry it had to be this one because  quite frankly  this is a dog    and even with jimmy stewart and charles coburn  both of whom were great actors  br    br   the problem with the film is simple  it tries to put too much  too quickly  in to a story about a young lawyer  john manson played by stewart  who marries jane  played by lombard  within an hour of meeting her  what  s that clich    marry in haste  repent at leisure     br    br   in short  the story is a series of episodes that show the couples   worsening financial status  their troubles with john  s live in mother  their struggles to pay the bills  john  s diminished status at the office  the arrival of their baby son  john jnr  unexpected and causing additional friction at home with mother   the couples   angst about their marriage  the baby  s sickness which worsens  thus necessitating an heroic flight by a lone pilot  in a fierce storm  to bring a special serum to save the child  and finally john being accepted as a junior partner at the law firm  br    br   how many more clich  d situations could the writers include  maybe mother dying soon after  there wasn  t much comedy  the drama was lacklustre  at best  the dialog was painful to hear  only the acting of the four main players was adequate  br    br   this was the period at the end of the great depression with the usa coming out of its long downturn    during which many people experienced all of the events portrayed in the movie  br    br   so  it made sense for selznick to reaffirm good ol   home spun american values of family  relationships  heroism  perseverance  and initiative    all against the backdrop of the   average   american family  who better to use than jimmy stewart and carol lombard   br    br   and  it should be noted that the film was released in early       so  it was planned in         soon after the usa began to get production going for the coming world war ii  hence  this sort of film was a great booster for the general public  at that time  many of who would soon have to join england in war  as many here would know  hollywood and washington formed an uneasy alliance before  during and after the war  br    br   however  i  m glad i saw it    as a piece of disguised socio political propaganda  but  i  ll have to see other lombard films to gain a better appreciation of her acting range  br    br   as another reviewer noted  see this one just to say that you  ve seen all of stewart  s movies  otherwise  don  t bother             unfortunately the only spoiler in this review is that there  s nothing to spoil about that movie even if b  mattei had never done any master piece he use to do his job with a bit of humor and craziness that made him a fun eurotrash director  but for the last    years he seemed to have lost it this film is just empty  nothing at all to wake us up from the deep sleep you sink into after the first    min no sex  no blood it  s suppose to be about snuff   no actors  no dialogs  just as bad as an     t v film it  s even worse than his last cannibals and zombies epics so rest in peace bruno  you will stay in our minds forever anyway  thanks to such unforgettable gems as zombi    robowar rats  l  altro inferno virus  cruel jaws and few others so except if you want to see b mattei possessed by jess franco  s spirit  s new film  pass on this one but if you don  t know this nice artisan  s career track down his old films and have fun             i enjoyed watching this well acted movie very much it was well acted particularly by actress helen hunt and actors steven weber and jeff fahey it was a very interesting movie filled with drama and suspense from the beginning to the very end i reccomend that everyone take the time to watch this made for television movie it is excellent and has great acting              hypothetical situations abound  one time director harry ralston gives us the ultimate post apocalyptic glimpse with the world dead  left in the streets  in the stores  and throughout the landscape  sans in the middle of a forgotten desert  one lone survivor  attempting to rekindle his sanity  takes food from the city to his bungalow in this desert  all alone  he hopes for more  but with nobody around  he is left with white underwear  and a passion for a local indian tribe    until the discovery of a camera which opens up new doors and breaks the barriers of human co existence  alan  a man of the book  is left on earth after an unknown disaster  thinking he is alone  he begins living life his way    until  jeri ryan  appears  like she would in any dream  out of the woods  disheveled  and unhappy to find the final man alive to be     well     like alan  anyway  they try to co exist  fail  get drunk  and before creating the ultimate dystopia  they run into redneck raphael  played by newcomer    dan montgomery jr   bonds are torn  confusion sets in  a couple becomes a third wheel  and the battle between physically inept nerd vs  brainless jock  even with nobody left on the planet  it becomes a truth that even the darkest of human nature will arise  br    br   using a variable film technique  ralston gives us a mediocre story based loosely on another film entitled   the quiet earth    which i will be viewing next  oddly which he never gives any credit towards  with a borrowed story  i guess he does a decent job of reinterpreting it  his punch seems to be lacking at the beginning while ralston tries to find his stride  borrowing yet again from other film director  s techniques to attempt to find his own  he opens the film interestingly enough  but fails to answer any direct answers  sure  the final days have arrived  but could there be a concise answer as to   how   or better yet   why   these select few survived  a spookier beginning would have led us stronger into a comical film  the juxtaposition would have been like   shawn of the dead    but instead left us feeling like we were watching a   made for tv   program  listening to the audio commentary  i have respect for ralston because he worked diligently to get this film made  and his passion nearly sells the film  but you could tell from his interaction with the cast that he wasn  t as happy with his overall final product  there were mistakes  ones that he pointed out and others that he was ashamed to point out  while this does make for decent independent film making  it sometimes feels cheap  and in ralston  s case  it was the latter  br    br   i must admit  david arnott  s portrayal of alan hooked me  he played that wimpy  school nerd  adult role very well  he was funny to both watch and listen to  and thus he became sympathetic to the viewer  he was a key player in keeping the film together  alas  i cannot say the same for the rest  this was dan montgomery  s first film  and it was obvious    i mean    really really obvious  there were scenes in which i thought the cue card was about to come out and read the lines for him  perhaps even giving us a more realistic performance  but alas  it wasn  t the case  then there was jeri ryan  she pulled into her character near the end of the film  which to me  was the culmination of the entire piece of art  she goes from estranged unknown to bitter cranky insane girlfriend by the end  confused  again  she fell into her character by the end  giving us just a glimpse of what she could have probably done as her acting matured  even as the commentary progressed  all that she contributed was a laugh  giggle  or   ohhh  look at that color   moment  while her beauty may sell tickets  one may want to consider knowledge to be just as beautiful  this was her first film  so can i be too harsh   br    br   overall  this film felt like it was missing something  i though the idea was strong    the premise that even with only a peppering of people remaining on the earth the evil of human nature still exists  jealousy cannot be killed by bacteria or bombs  maybe because it is consumed by zinc   and we as a race will always want what we cannot have  ralston is not a surprising director  his techniques are flawed and pre used  but he does know how to make a low budget comedy  i think our idea of   funny   is different  so that is why i couldn  t find myself laughing at many of the bits he found   hysterical    his actors provided the level of acting needed for this film  which was lower than average  his film was loose  meaning that there were elements never quite explained or tackled  i e  anything with wings survived      which overall harmed the intensity of the film  this was a comedy  but it could have been much darker and much much funnier  for those thinking that roger avery was a huge element to this film  as we learn from their commentary  all he was there for was money    the was in essence  the bank for   the last man    don  t get your hopes up for any classic avery moments  br    br   don  t expect more from ralston    and that is how i will end it  br    br   grade     out of                   br    br   i must admit  i was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of   cut   last night  though was delighted with the unexpected australian horror gem  i am a true horror fan as true as they come  and found   cut   to not only be the best of the genre australia has ever produced  but one of the great parody comedy films of late  br    br   my only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements   the film was not overly clever in it  s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in every possible cliche of the horror genre they could  i am certain this was intended as humour    hoping this was intended as humour  br    br   and of course  there was the gore  br    br   the use of the   customised   garden shears was brilliance   besides the expected stabs and slashes  in short  there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths  enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth  br    br   the appearance of both kylie minogue  short that her appearance was  and molly ringwald was just another reason to see the film   both performances were fantastic  as well as simon bossell    the castle    in a brilliant role as the jokey technician  br    br   all in all  i think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years  as well as a beautiful satire parody   toungue in cheek till the very end  br    br   loved it  go see it             i am so happy not to live in an american small town  because whenever i  m shown some small town in the states it is populated with all kinds of monsters among whom flesh hungry zombies  evil aliens and sinister ghosts are most harmless  in this movie a former doctor  who  s just done time for an accidental killing of his wife in a car crash  directs his steps to the nearest small town   he must have never in his life seen a flick about any small towns   which happens to be the purgatory flats  and  of course  as soon as he arrives there all the hell breaks loose  he meets a blond chick who out of all creatures most resembles a cow both in facial expressions and in brain functioning and at once falls in love with her  but there is a tiny handicap  she is already married to a very small time drug dealer who in a minute gets himself shot pitifully not dead  to know what has come out of all this you should watch the movie for yourself  i  ll just tell you that it  s slightly reminiscent of u turn by oliver stone but is a way down in all artistic properties             like anyone else who bought this  i was duped by the      pieces of extreme gore   and   banned in    countries   or whatever it says in the box  i have to admit i am a huge gore fan and i am always amazed when films can lay it on thick and look convincing doing it  tom savini  rick baker and greg cannom are some of the best in the business  the revolutionized make up effects in the     s  today  you don  t need them as everything is done on computer  but computers cannot compare to the visual wizardry that these three men could conjure up  but i digress  br    br   watching fantastically gory films like fulci  s gates to hell or even savini  s crowning achievement  friday the   th the final chapter  you can appreciate all that goes into making a terrifically gory film  you can  t tell the difference between reality and magic  br    br   i can  t imagine another reason why anyone would see cannibal ferox but the gore that is ostensibly omnipotent in this film  if that is the reason you seek this film  then you are wasting your money  as many other reviewers in here have noted  most of the gore is an aftermath  you don  t see the torture  or the bloodshed as it happens  you see whatever it looks like afterwords  br    br   the gore  well  it  s here  but not as much as one would hope  or expect  a man does get castrated and a women does get hanged by her breasts  but other then those two scenes  and one involving a scalping  there is nothing really much else to this film  the scenes of gore even in these three mentioned  are still pretty tame in comparison to what you were hoping for  maybe it  s just me and my sick and twisted experience in the horror and gore genre  but i was expecting a bit more  call me sick or twisted  but isn  t that the only reason people are watching this film in the first place  i honestly found myself bored in a lot of places  br    br   cannibal ferox is just another film that tries to capitalize on a craze of a superior film  while cannibal holocaust is not exactly a great film  it is much better than this tripe  if you go out of your way to buy this for         you will feel cheated  br    br                   i always felt that ms  merkerson had never gotten a role fitting her skills  familiar to millions as the lt  on law and order  she has been seen in a number of theatrical releases  always in a supporting role  hbo  s lackawanna blues changes that and allows this talented actress to shine as nanny  successful entrepreneur in a world changing from segregation to integration  but the story is really about the colorful array of characters that she and her adopted son meet in a boarding house in lackawanna  new york  a suburb of buffalo  br    br   the story could be set in any major african american community of the     s and     s from atlanta  s sweet auburn to new york  s harlem  but the segregation integration angle is only a subtle undercurrent in the colorful lives of the folks at nanny  s boarding house  the story revolves around nanny  s relationships with all kinds of people  played by some of the best actors in the business  i purposely did not say black actors  this ensemble is a stunning array of talent who happen to be black  except for jimmy smits  of course  i recommend this film as a fun and colorful look at a bygone day             this will not likely be voted best comedy of the year  a few too many coincidences and plot holes  however we are talking about a movie where a hit man and a white bread salesman become buddies so a few vagaries shouldn  t come as too much of a surprise  brosnan is excellent in this role  gone is the wooden james bond  a role he was wasted in   if he can maintain this kind of quality i hope he continues to make comedies  greg kinnear is also excellent as brosnan  s straight man  i  ve read a few negative comments in here about hope davis but i thought she was quite good as a mousy housewife with a dark side buried deep within  there are lots of good chuckles as brosnan sleazes his way through and a few scenes where i nearly died laughing  my father  a consultant  nearly lost it when julian describes himself as a   facilitator    much like   grosse pointe blank    another hit man comedy  the humour can be very dark  if you are in to that be prepared to enjoy yourself             as a casual listener of the rolling stones  i thought this might be interesting  not so  as this film is very   of its age    in the       s  to me  someone born in the       s  this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap  but i am sure this film was not made for me  but people who were active during th       s  i expected drugs galore with th stones  i was disappointed  it actually showed real life  hard work in the studio  so much so i felt as if i was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film  i have not seen any of the directors other films  but i suspect they follow a similar style of directing  sort of   amatuerish   which gave a feeling like the tv show eurotrash  badly directed  tackily put together and lacking in real entertainment value  my only good opinion of this is that i didn  t waste money on it  it came free with a sunday paper             watch the original with the same title from       this made for tv movie  is just god awful  although it does use  as far as i can tell  almost the same dialog  it just doesn  t work  is it the acting  the poor directing  ok so it  s made for tv  but why watch a bad copy  when you can get your hands on the superb original  especially as you  ll be spoiled to the plot and won  t enjoy the original as much  as if you  ve watched it first   br    br   there are a few things that are different from the original  it  s shorter for once   but all are for the worse  the actors playing the parts here  just don  t fit the bill  you just don  t believe them and who could top edward g  robinsons performance from the original  if you want  only watch it after you  ve seen the original and even then you  ll be very brave  if you watch it through  it  s almost sacrilege             director don siegel really impressed me with this film  it is starkly shot  graphic without being visually graphic  well acted by all concerned  and covers some of the most taboo issues of any day in a workmanlike  almost expected normalcy hitherto not seen in any other film by this reviewer  i didn  t know what to expect sitting down to watch this  a civil war movie or some kind of     s soft core peddling with eastwood descending on a school for girls in the south  but really is is neither of those things but rather and examination  exploration  and descent into the soul of men and women   a dark commentary on what is at the core of the civilized  as one reviewer previously noted  none   none   of the characters are likable by the film  s end and yet each one is interesting  complex  and enigmatic  eastwood plays cpl  mcburney  a union soldier found by young pamelyn ferdin you  ll recognize that voice as soon as you hear it   a girl at a school for manners headed by geraldine page amidst the chaos that was the civil war   particularly in the south  soon  page  teacher elizabeth hartman  lovely  young seductress carol  and even ferdin amy have emotional sexual ties to eastwood   each having their own needs and secrets and problems  eastwood is not a nice man  he plays the girls off of each other always trying to get the sexual advantage  in the unfolding we get some real interesting things revealed from latent lesbianism to incest  the beguiled  for me  is a masterpiece that far exceeded my expectations on every creative front  this might be except for invasion of the body snatchers  siegel  s best film  it certainly is one of eastwood  s best real performances  page is always so very good and hartman  fe rdin  et al excellent  the gothic manse set for the school is effectively claustrophobic  some of the sexual laced scenes disturbing  and what happens to eastwood is a leg up on much of the competition for creepy  eerie  demented film             anyone who lived through the ages of revenge of the nerds and girlpower will appreciate this film  it is one of those films that delivers everything you want in a   spring break movie   plus it makes fun of the college film genre  it  s funny  it  s got a cast to die for  amy pohler  rachel dratch   sophie monk   parker posey  jane lynch  amber tamblyn  missi pyle   and its guaranteed to make you laugh out loud  writer  actor rachel dratch is a comic genius and sophie monk is such a great villain  wilson phillips  omg   i  m just repeating myself now     it will live on with girls who like miranda july but feel like eating ice cream and pretending they  re dumb             arguably the finest serial ever made no argument here thus far  about earthman flash gordon  professor zarkov  and beautiful dale arden traveling in a rocket ship to another universe to save the planet  along the way  in spellbinding  spectacular  and action packed chapters flash and his friends along with new found friends such as prince barin  prince thun  and the awesome king vultan pool their resources together to fight the evils and armies of the merciless ming of mongo and the jealous treachery of his daughter priness aura now she  s a car    this serial is not just a cut above most serials in terms of plot  acting  and budget   it is miles ahead in these areas  produced by universal studios it has many former sets at its disposable like the laboratory set from the bride of frankenstein and the opera house from the phantom of the opera just to name a few  the production values across the board are advanced  in my most humble opinion  for       the costumes worn by many of these strange men and women are really creative and first rate  we get hawk men  shark men  lion men  high priests  creatures like dragons  octasacks  orangapoids  and tigrons oh my  and many  many other fantastic things  are all of them believable and first rate special effects  no way  but for      most are very impressive  the musical score is awesome and the chapter beginnings are well written  lengthy enough to revitalize viewer memories of the former chapter  and expertly scored  director frederick stephani does a great job piecing everything together wonderfully and creating a worthy film for alex raymond  s phenom comic strip  lastly  the acting is pretty good in this serial  all too often serials have either no names with no talent surrounding one or two former talents   here most everyone has some ability  don  t get me wrong  this isn  t a shakespeare troupe by any means  but buster crabbe does a workmanlike  likable job as flash  he is ably aided by jean arden  priscella lawson  and the rest of the cast in general with two performers standing out  but before i get to those two let me add as another reviewer noted  it must have been amazing for this serial to get by the hayes office  i see more flesh on flash and on jean rogers and priscella lawson than in movies decades later  the shorts crabbe and unfortunately for all of us professor zarkov  frank shannon   wears are about as form fitting a pair of shorts guys can wear  the girls are wearing mid drifts throughout and are absolutely beautiful jean rogers may have limited acting talent but she is a blonde bombshell  lawson is also very sultry and sensuous and beautiful  but for me the two actors that make the serial are charles middleton as ming  officious  sardonic  merciless  and fun  middleton is a class act  jack   tiny   lipson plays king vultan  boisterous  rousing  hilarious   a symbol for pure joy in life and the every essence of hedonism  lipson steals each and every scene he is in  the plot meanders here  there  and everywhere   but flash gordon is the penultimate serial  space opera  and the basis for loads of science fiction to follow  excellent             i have to say that the events of      didn  t hit me until i saw this documentary  it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation  i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers  i was sick of hearing about it  when this was aired on tv a year and a day later  i was bawling my eyes out  it was the first time i had cried since the attack  i highly recommend this documentary  i am watching it now on tv    years later  and i am still crying over the tragedies  the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing  it was an accident  and look where it got them  these two brothers make me want to have been there to help             perfect movies are rare  even my favorite films tend to have flaws   rear window looks a little stagey at times  chris elliot  s character in groundhog day doesn  t work  the music score in best years of our lives is too cheesy  the beginning of nights of cabiria is a little too slow   but this film is perfectly executed from start to finish   br    br   the script is brilliant  the acting is superb all around  although reese witherspoon and sam waterston are amazing  the whole cast shines   the directing and the photography are inspired  and the music score is touching without being intrusive  like some miramax scores that are too manipulative   every sad moment is truly moving  every light moment makes me smile  this truly is one of the best films i have ever seen and i wish there were more films like it   br    br   i am glad that reese witherspoon has gone on to stardom after this film  but i am sorry to see that her recent movies are so much more escapist and silly than this serious film which is about real people  real feelings and real problems  brilliant  a must see             this has to be one of the   worst movies ever made  the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger     but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better  the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way  just a few of the awful moments in the movie  a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying     and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the     mile per hour winds    thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at      feet  thats impossible even for     pilots with thousands of hour experience  when on the runway  perfectly straight of course  she is instructed to pull on the flaps  huh   come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds  when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power  i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie  but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary  this is a movie you want to miss  take my word for it             regardless of what anyone says  its a b movie  and the effects are poorly done   if you  re a vampire fanatic  i suppose it would be ok  not    out of     you others here cant sincerely mean that   we are to view this as a movie  not read it as a book  so the effects and characters are important  as well as the story  the story are good  but it doesn  t carry the film  no wonder it has a low rating over all  i write this because i chose to see this movie when i saw some good reviews here on imdb  but got severely disappointed  don  t get me wrong  i thought the blade movies was awesome  and loved the underworld movies  but this characters aren  t close  the make up on the vampires is poorly done  and the effects are worse  this sucks  i might not have gotten so disappointed if i had not read reviews here that told me how great it was  the reviewers must have had something to do with the production company or something  seriously  if you think this is awesome  you don  t care about acting or make up  this is better as a book    out of    for an ok story              i want very much to believe that the above quote  specifically  the english subtitle translation   which was actually written  not spoken  in a rejection letter a publisher sends to the protagonist  was meant to be self referential in a tongue in cheek manner  but if so  director leos carax apparently neglected to inform the actors of the true nature of the film  they are all so dreadfully earnest in their portrayals that i have to conclude carax actually takes himself seriously here  or else has so much disdain for everyone  especially the viewing audience  that he can  t be bothered letting anyone in on the joke  br    br   some auteurs are able to get away with making oblique  bizarre films because they do so with   lan and unique personal style  e g   david lynch and alejandro jodorowsky   others use a subtler approach while still weaving surreal elements into the fabric of the story  e g   krzysztof kieslowski  and david cronenberg  s later  less bizarre works   in pola x  carax throws a disjointed mess at the viewer and then dares him to find fault with it  well  here it is  the pacing is erratic and choppy  in particular continuity is often dispensed with  superfluous characters abound  e g   the gypsy mother and child   most of the performances are overwrought  the lighting is often poor  particularly in the oft discussed sex scene  unconnected scenes are thrust into the film for no discernible reason  and the list goes on  br    br   not to be completely negative  it should be noted that there were some uplifting exceptions  i liked the musical score  even the cacophonous industrial techno music being played in the sprawling  abandoned complex to which the main characters retreat in the second half of the film  perhaps a reference to andy warhol  s   factory   of the     s    much of the photography of the countryside was beautiful  an obvious attempt at contrast with the grimy city settings  and  even well into middle age  cathering deneuve shows that she still has   it    her performance was also the only one among the major characters that didn  t sink into bathos  br    br   there was an earlier time when i would regard such films as   pola x   more charitably  experimentation is admirable  even when the experiment doesn  t work  but carax tries nothing new here  the film is a pastiche of elements borrowed from countless earlier films  and after several decades of movie viewing and literally thousands of films later  i simply no longer have the patience for this kind of unoriginal  poorly crafted tripe  at this early moment in the   st century  one is left asking  with the exception of jean pierre jeunet  are there  any  directors in france who know how to make a watchable movie anymore  rating                   it  s hard to praise this film much  the cgi for the dragon was well done  but lacked proper modelling for light and shadow  also  the same footage is used endlessly of the dragon stomping through corridors which becomes slightly tedious  br    br   i was amazed to see   marcus aurelius   in the acting credits  wondering what an ex emperor of the roman empire was doing acting in this film  like   whoopie goldberg   it must be an alias  and can one blame him for using one if he appears in this stinker  br    br   the story might been interesting  but the acting is flat  and direction is tedious  if you must watch this film  go around to your friend  s house and get drunk while doing so   then it  ll be enjoyable             i remember going to see the movie in the summer of      with my parents  and being pretty into it at the time  of course  i was seven at the time  br    br   right before the jackson movies came out  my wife and i rented this movie since she had never seen it and i was feeling nostalgic  br    br   ralph bakshi ran out of money about mid way through the animation process for this movie  and was forced to drastically cut corners on this production  since this movie was done primarily with rotoscoping  the animation technique for people on a budget  this is saying something  much of this movie is animation only in the very loosest sense of the word  there are some scenes which are very obviously just people standing in front of a screen  with maybe some animation effects superimposed on top of them  br    br   because of budget constraints  the movie    already a compression of   the fellowship of the rings   and part of   the two towers      was pared down even more  what you get is sort of like a film strip version of the cliff notes of the books  br    br   its not all bad  though  the animation brings a warmth to it  that i found lacking in the jackson movies  its nice to imagine what it could have been like with decent funding  br    br   this movie is also noteworthy for having the sequel which never came  several years later  a half hearted half hour long tv special was aired  which was meant to wrap things up  all i will say about that is that it was a musical             just finished watching  ftm  the trailers intrigued me so much i actually went to see it on opening weekend  something i never do  needless to say i was very disappointed  the story has so much potential and it  s frustrating to see it get screwed up  i really feel the problem with the movie was the directing and matthew mcconaughey  first off i am not a mm hater  i thought he was awesome in both reign of fire and lone star  i enjoyed his performance in those movies without having to see him with his shirt off     times  yes we all get it that he a good looking guy with a nice body  but i think most people knew this    years ago when he came on the scene in a time to kill  showing him with his shirt off pumping iron like a sweaty madman     times in the movie is totally unnecessary  i think one time would have been sufficient  it wouldn  t surprise me if they threw those unnecessary scenes in so girlfriends and wives would be willing to tag along with their significant other  no woman wants to see a movie about sports gambling  unless      enough about that  let  s get into his role  i feel his acting was very forced and he didn  t seem very comfortable  i know his character was supposed to be this charming southerner  but his lines were corny and cheesy  it was almost like he was referencing days and confused lines a few times  in short  i didn  t like his character even though i was supposed to  the accent  his shirt off  corny pick up lines  weak sales pitches  his character was just too much of a tool  as brandon or jonathan  pacino and assante were great  but that   no surprise  piven is fun to watch as arie    oooops i mean jerry  i just feel this movie was very commercial and put together poorly  it  s insulting that they could take a great story  and throw in crap ingredients to try and make it a box office success     cool story that appeals to the male man    hunky hollywood actor for female women  make sure he has numerous scenes with shirt off lifting weights     al pacino with   great speech scenes  and    great one liners    every character shall be dressed in thousand dollars suites and have an extremely dark tan    jeremy piven to play the same character he did in entourage and old school    throw in armand assante to seal the deal    plot  good writing  character development  and intelligent casting are unnecessary br    br   this will be good enough for most people  but not me  anybody who disagrees with me  ask your self this  would this movie be much better if  a  directed by sodeberg b  decaprio or ed norton as brandon instead of mm br    br   i will probably be part of the minority in thinking this movie sucks  i realized this when the woman next to me started crying during the ridiculous ending scene of pacino shedding a fake tear while embracing russo  the financial success of this movie will ensure one thing  the movie going public gets what the movie going public wants  big budget crapola             i was watching the sci fi channel when this steaming pile of crap came on  while not as bad as wynorski  s   curse of the komodo    this still sucks   bad  wynorski uses the same island as in   curse of the komodo    as well as the same actors and house  the effects are top notch  suprising  but thats about it        i don  t know what else to say about this movie       oh yeah  as in   curse of the komodo    the government gets involved and decides to bomb the island  also    when i saw this part i laughed hysterically   a komanbra     part man  komodo and cobra    overall this movie is utter crap even on bad movie standards  just remember if jim wynorski had anything to do with a movie    steer clear    to avoid from falling asleep keep repeating   it  s almost over  it  s almost over         out of               i only heard about driving lessons through the itv adverts  and to be honest  i didn  t know how much i would like it  i switched on the tv last night and was totally surprised  driving lessons is a modest  simple film which draws you in right from the start  rupert grint plays the part of socially awkward teenager ben brilliantly  he  s definitely one to look out for in the future  dame eve walton is played by the fabulous julie walters  i loved the simple plot and the way the actors portrayed their characters with great sensitivity  the highlight of the film  for me was evie  s rather colourful poem  it shows how friendships can form between the most unlikely pairs  in my opinion  watching driving lessons is a great way to spend   hours  the scenery was also striking  especially the countryside  anyone who can call this sparkling comedy forgettable  i strongly disagree with            for greta garbo  s first talking picture  mgm wisely chose eugene o  neill  s pultizer prize winning      play anna christie   br    br   also wisely  the producers backed garbo up with not one but two members of the original broadway cast  george marion as anna  s father  chris  and james t  mack as johnny the priest   transmuted to   johnny the harp   for films so as not to offend    br    br   this little change is interesting  like too many films accused  by those who want movies to be movies and ignore their origins  of being   little more than filmed stage plays    the problem is not the play but the movie makers who wouldn  t be more faithful to the property  by diluting a great cinematic stage work so it wouldn  t offend anyone  or opening it up because they could  too many lose the very qualities which made the piece worth filming in the first place   br    br   fortunately  the respect the studio had for both o  neill and garbo allowed anna christie to survive the normally destructive process admirably in frances marion  s generally sensitive screen adaptation  wonder of wonders  marion even allows the point of the scene where garbo  s anna reveals her past on   the farm   to the man she badly wants to marry and the father who sent her there in tact  what the league of decency must have thought of that   br    br   the source play  s greatest problem has always been that chris  s friend marthy tends to walk away with the first act and then disappears from the last two so that anna can take stage   the two sides of the genuinely good woman men don  t always recognize   br    br   the perfectly cast marie dressler  who had cut her teeth on the broadway stage as well before going to hollywood  is the perfect balance for garbo  s anna in this area as well and the fast moving film at only    minutes  doesn  t allow us too much time to miss her   one of the few benefits from atmosphere being shown rather than eloquently described in the original   and screenwriter marion is wise enough to stray from o  neill to bring dressler back for a touching scene two thirds of the way through the film that will remind many of julie laverne  s second act appearance in show boat   br    br   anna and marthy  s early scene together on screen     minutes into the film  taking each other  s measure and setting up all the tension of the rest of the story is among the most affecting scenes in the entire piece  not to be missed   br    br   anna christie is great tragic play and a good film drama  it  s hard to imagine that a latter day remake  which would almost certainly lose the grit and atmosphere of this      remake  it was first filmed without sound in        also with george marion  s original broadway chris  could improve on this excellent filming   br    br   the internal scenes hew closest to the play  but the exteriors shouldn  t be missed by anyone with an eye to atmosphere  while the background screen work is not to modern technical standards  the backgrounds give a better glimpse than most films of the era of the actual world in which the screen play is set  especially in the new york harbor   br    br   nearly all garbo  s naturalistic performances of the sound era have held up superbly  only the too often parodied death scene from camille    years later  will occasionally draw snickers because of the heavy handed direction and the parodies   but this anna christie  together with the variety of her      films  mata hari and grand hotel  and the sublime lubitsch touch on her      comedy  ninotchka    garbo laughs      surely stand as her best  br    br   o  neill fans who are taken with this play at the edge of his lauded   sea plays    should track down the fine world war ii shaped film released in the year before the u s  entered the conflict  the long voyage home         it is almost as skillfully drawn from those sea plays as this one is from anna christie  and features a youngish john wayne in one of his rare non westerns supporting a fine cast of veteran actors showing him the way             let me set the scene  it is the school holidays and there is absolutely nothing at the movies  i am with my friend deciding what to see  we look for a movie that is starting soon and   the grinch   comes up  we buy tickets not knowing what to expect  what we got was a roller coaster of fun  br    br   jim carrey  who may i add is my no   actor in the whole world  was absolutely magnificent as the grinch in this ron howard  s best movie  next to apollo      the way that this movie was made  the scenery  the actors  the props and the music was just amazing  it really brought this childhood movie to life  br    br   the story is based upon the story of the grinch  as we all know the grinch is a horrible person who just can  t stand christmas  he lives high above whoville and has never mingled well with the townfolk  but one little girl is going to change the grinch  s look on life and on others in a drastic way  br    br   cindy lou who  played by adorable new actress taylor momsem  meets the grinch as finds the kind part of him straight away  she attempts to break the barrier and to help the grinch move in and mingle with the towns people  br    br   all up this movie is a barrel of laughs for the whole family both kids and parents  a solid        well done jim  br    br               as a long time fan of all the star trek series i found this a disappointing episode  and i wonder if the liberal use of   flashbacks   featuring will riker  s exploits  both positive  and largely romantic  and negative  lots of pain  and a crewmate  s death was a money saving device  as were many of their   bottle shows    episodes in which all scenes take place on the enterprise   diana muldaur who also appeared at least twice on the original series  deserved a better final appearance than this for her character  dr  kate pulaski  loyal viewers  in the star trek world  is there any other kind   also were shortchanged  this was the last episode of second season  thus  the season ended   not with a bang   but with   a whimper               this tv series was one of the ones i loved when i was a kid  even though i see it now through the pink shaded glasses of nostalgia  i can still tell it was a quality show  very educational but still funny  i have not seen the original french version  only the swedish  i have no idea how good the dubbing was  it was too long ago to remember  br    br   the premise of the show was to show you how the body works  i swear  school still hasn  t taught me half of what i know from this show  it also tied in other things  like what happens if you eat unhealthy food and don  t exercise  with nice examples within the body  who wants to have another bar of chocolate when you know miniature virus tanks can invade you   d the cartoon looked nice  very kids friendly of course  but done with care  cells  viruses  electric signals in the brain  antibodies and everything else are represented by smiling cartoon figures  looking pretty much how you  d expect what they should look like in the animated body  br    br   this  and the series about history especially the environmentally scary finale  were key parts of my childhood  i  m so happy i found them here             fans of the hbo series   tales from the crypt   are going to love this moh episode  those who know the basic archetypal stories that most of the classic ec comics were based on  will recognize this one right off the bat  br    br   underrated indie favorite martin donovan  also an excellent writer   co author of the screenplays for apartment zero and death becomes her  is the kind of guy whose everyman good looks can go either way  he could play a really nice if misunderstood guy next door  or he can play the same role with a creepy undertone of corrosive sleaziness  in the case of right to die  he takes the latter approach  and it definitely works  br    br   donovan is a doctor who has recently had an affair with his slutty office receptionist  robin sydney   much to the displeasure of his inconsolable  unforgiving spouse  abbey  julia anderson   when the two of them get involved in a terrible car accident while returning from an unsuccessful weekend of   making up    and she  s horribly burned in a fire  he  s reluctant to pull the plug on her  not without some enthusiastic nudging from his even sleazier lawyer and best buddy  corbin bernsen  looking the worse for wear these days    br    br   but abbey  s never been one to give up without a fight  and that  s where the ec theme of the episode comes in  cuckolded husbands   and wives   have always been the genre  s favorite subject matter for some spooky  and ooky  supernatural shenanigans  and this case is definitely no exception  if anything  the ramped up quotient of sex and gore must have bill gaines cackling with glee in his mausoleum somewhere  br    br   and that  s not to mention that john esposito  s original script does give the adultery angle just a slight twist  you don  t realize as you  re watching that you only know half the story  until close to the end    think what lies beneath with more guts and gazongas  and you  re there   br    br   not a bad effort  but not the best of the lot  either  at least rob schmidt does display touches of flair here and there with the direction  especially in a scene that makes cell phone picture messaging into a truly horrifying experience indeed  as with most moh episodes  this one is following a prevalent theme this season of flaying and dismemberment  so the extremely squeamish need not apply             dirty war is absolutely one of the best political  government  and well written t v  drama  s in the    years  br    br   the acting is superb  the writing is spectacular  br    br   diry war reveals the true side of why we are not ready to respond to a nuclear  biological  and radiological terrorist attack here on american soil  br    br   dirty war should be made into a major motion picture   it  s that good  i highly recommend this great drama to everyone who desire to know the truth  br    br   this t v  drama reveals how british intelligence  mi    mi   attempt to expose a terrorist plot and conspiracy to destroy innocent victims  because of england  s involvement in the iraq war  br    br   the scenes of different parts of london  england are also spectacular  br    br   dirty war is a must see               some may go for a film like this but i most assuredly did not  a college professor  david norwell  suddenly gets a yen for adoption  he pretty much takes the first child offered  a bad choice named adam  as it turns out adam doesn  t have both oars in the water which  almost immediately  causes untold stress and turmoil for dr  norwell  this sob story drolly played out with one problem after another  all centered around adam  s inabilities and seizures  why norwell wanted to complicate his life with an unknown factor like an adoptive child was never explained  along the way the good doctor managed to attract a wifey to share in all the hell the little one was dishing out  personally  i think both of them were one beer short of a sixpack  bypass this yawner             this is the who at their most powerful  although before the masterwork who  s next  which would provide anthems like baba o  reily and wont get fooled again  this film shows the group in transition from mod rockers to one of the biggest live bands of the     s  br    br   daltrey shows what being a front man is all about  entwistle steady as ever   br    br   moon is great  check out the ongoing conversation with the drum tech  and see him playing   side saddle   whilst having a bass drum head replaced  br    br   townsend even looks like he  s enjoying himself occasionally  br    br   considering they took to the stage at  am no one in the crowd was asleep   br    br   there are not many bands these days could produce a set as tight as this and it is difficult to imagine any of the bands of today producing a concert that in    years time will be be enjoyed as much as this one             this filmmaker wanted to make a movie without having a story to tell    and did so  really awful jumble of unlikely unexplained coincidences and unidentifiable plot line  all without character or clear motivation  br    br   we get clich   snapshots instead of characters  one in particular is the diminutive and beautiful crime boss  who projects an overdone   tough guy   persona and casts a cartoonish shadow of intimidation over the actual tough guys who have been brought in to work for her  nothing much startling to look at in the film except for one shot when the boys hit the road and one of them carries a tiny suitcase  as in  the smallest from a complete american tourister set  in a bright  sky blue  without explanation or apology  otherwise it  s standard visually    one other exception is a compelling shot of a beautiful bridge in ct             they filmed this movie out on long island  where i grew up  my brother and his girlfriend were extras in this movie  apparently there is some party scene where they are all drinking beer   which they told me was colored water  tasted disgusting  and was very hard to keep swallowing over and over again  especially in the funnel scenes   yet none of us ever heard of the movie being released anywhere in any form  it never came out in the theaters  obviously  and it  as far as i knew  was never released on video  and i  m sure wasn  t released on dvd  yet it looks like it was seen by some people  albeit it probably very few  so there must be something  i would absolutely love to purchase this for my brother  yet there is no way i can find it anywhere  does anybody know anything about when where how this movie could be purchased  and which format that would be             that  s how burt reynolds describes this film  which happens to be his best ever  he plays tom sharky  a vice detective who  s on the trail of an international mobster  vittorio gassman  and the man he  s financing to be the next governor of georgia  earl holliman   in the novel by william diehl  the story is more complex because the guy  s running for president  this is a very long movie that feels more like three hours instead of two  the filming in downtown atlanta and the peachtree plaza hotel sets the mood just right for the story  reynolds doesn  t do much laughing in this one compared to his comedy films  he  s very serious here  especially in the beginning of the movie because he gets demoted for a dope bust that goes wrong  at times though  the movie plays more like a voyeuristic drama than a crime film with burt trying to get close to the mobster  s woman  only towards the end of the film does the violence get cranked up that leads to the bang bang climax  just like the great jazz score in dirty harry by lalo schifrin  sharky  s machine features an excellent urban jazz soundtrack with many guest stars including chet baker  julie london  flora purim   buddy de franco  the manhattan transfer  doc severinson  sarah vaughan and joe williams  al capps handles the score with magic  this movie has become one of the best crime dramas ever  check it out  br    br   score    out of    stars            human traffic is a view into an average weekend for a group of friends  it is a fly on the wall view into their lives  and minds  which will show you how this group of friends relate to each other  there are many moments in that every one can relate to  like being out of you skull at parties and talking complete rubbish to strangers  the characters are all people that you can relate to and they are believable in the roles that they play in the movie  the situations that they are in are all situations that we all have found ourselves in  and that is where this film succeeds  the topics of sex and drugs are handled superbly as to no get in the way of the characters relationships with each other  the story to the film is not all that  but that is not a criticism  this is a film about people  this is a well written film  with a sound track to die for  d j  s pete tong has put together an superb selection of tracks for this file which all goes to make this one of the best films that i have seen in       after watching this film i felt like i had been out partying all weekend  fantastic movie  jo brand as the voice of reality   need i say more  br    br               this early biograph short was so much fun to watch  the second on disc one of d w  griffith  s   years of discovery   dvd set  highly recommended  it features three excellent performances by the main leads  and interesting to see henry b  walthall  the little colonel  birth of a nation  as a campy musician giving a countess the eye  and other things   br    br   the countess   husband goes berserk at his wife  s betrayal and has her walled into a little room with her paramour  it  s kind of incredible that they wouldn  t hear the wall going up  but hey  maybe the wine had something to do with it  here mr  johnson  father of silent player raymond hackett  gesticulates wildly and this adds to the melodrama  but in an unexpectedly comical way  the best moment comes at the end  as the lady passes out from shock and fear  once she realizes she  s doomed  henry picks up his instrument and   fans   it over her  the way he did it was so unexpected and in a strange way kind of sexy  and i just lost it  and laughed my head off  the expression on his face  from that moment i was charmed by henry b  walthall             baba   rajinikanth will never forget this name in his life  this is the movie which caused his downfall  it was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors  rajinikanth had to personally repay them for the losses incurred  soon after its release  he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably  its a very bad movie with horrible acting  bad quality makeup and pathetic screenplay  throughout the movie  rajinikanth looks like a person suffering from some disease  i  m one of the unfortunate souls who saw baba  first day first show in theatre  the audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre before the intermission  sorry  i  ll not recommend this one to anyone             written by oliver stone and directed by brian de palma  scarface paints a picture not easily forgotten  al pacino turns in a stunning performance as tony montana  a cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in florida  this gangster flick is harsh  violent  loud  gross  unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word   f  k   the most number of times  almost three hours long  and yes it can get repulsive  a stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord  br    br   also playing interesting characters are michelle pfeiffer  steven bauer  robert loggia  mary elizabeth mastrantonio  f  murray abraham and angel salazar  pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation  he manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression  this will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster  is that powerful enough for you  crime does not pay for long             first  the cgi in this movie was horrible  i watched it during a marathon of bad movies on the scifi channel  at the end when the owner of the park gets killed  it  s probably one of the worst examples of cgi i have even seen  even night of the living dead had better animation  br    br   that said  the movie had almost no plot  why were they on that island in particular  well  it wasn  t stated in the movie  and  why would the people keep coming into the cat  s area  makes no sense  br    br   one thing that stood out in this movie was moderately good acting  in what could be called a   b made for tv movie   movie  the acting was very good  parry shen stood out in particular  br    br   if you have absolutely nothing to do on a saturday  watch this movie  it may be good for some memorable quotes             i enjoyed it  there you go  i said it again  i even bought this movie on dvd and enjoyed it a couple of more times  call me old fashioned but i prefer movies like this to garbage like die hard   which hold up the box office and get critical acclaim just because you have some old guy saving america  van damme moves well for a guy of his age    i think   delivering kicks that reminds one of kickboxer  if you like old school action and and explosions  this is the movie to watch  this is one of van damme  s best works  br    br   van damme and steven seagal movies get released theatrically where i live so i never miss a chance to watch our old school action stars on the big screen             what a waste of talent  a very poor  semi coherent  script cripples this film  rather unimaginative direction  too  some very faint echoes of  fargo  here  but it just doesn  t come off             although it strays away from the book a little  you can  t help but love the atmospheric music and settings  br    br   the scenes in bath are just how they should be  although if you have watched it as many times as i have you notice that the background people are the same in each scene  but that aside  i like the scene where they are in the hot baths  but did the men and women really bathe together like that  you could see all the men perched around the outside leering at the women  it also seemed strange that they all had their hats on  but perhaps this was the style at the time  the ballroom scenes were very nice  the dancing and the outfits looked beautiful  i especially liked catherine  s dress in the first ballroom scene  br    br   northanger abbey looked suitably imposing  but i enjoyed the bath scenes better  br    br   schlesinger gives a good but not exceptional performance as catherine morland  googie withers gives the best performance as mrs allen i feel  br    br   ugh peter firth as mr tilney  he just talks a load of rubbish  and is not a clergyman as he should be  it  s hard to think of him being in love with catherine  but then the book never really gave that impression either  br    br   general tilney is played reasonably well by hardy  and stuart also gives a sort of good performance as isabella  ingrid lacey did not give a good performance as elinor tilney  as for john thorpe  well he gives the impression of a seedy and lustful man  perhaps not the character portrayed in the book  but i quite like it  br    br   i can handle scenes being cut from a book adaptation  but when new scenes and characters are added it usually annoys me  the marchioness  i hate her  she is not part of the northanger story and neither is her cartwheeling page boy  br    br   some of the script is peculiar  when catherine is asking elinor tilney about her mothers death she asks   i suppose you saw the body  how did it appear    what a silly thing to say  elinor  s calm response is stupid too  br    br   anyway please tell me if you agree or disagree with me            mario lewis of the competitive enterprise institute has written a definitive     page point by point  line by line refutation of this mendacious film  which should be titled a convenient lie  the website address where his debunking report  which is titled   a skeptic  s guide to an inconvenient truth   can be found at is  www cei org  a shorter    page version can be found at  www cei org pdf      pdf once you read those demolitions  you  ll realize that alleged   global warming   is no more real or dangerous than the y k scare of       which gore also endorsed  as he did the pseudo scientific film the day after tomorrow  which was based on a book written by alleged ufo abductee whitley strieber  as james   the amazing   randi does to psychics  and philip klass does to ufos  and gerald posner does to jfk conspir idiocy theories  so does mario lewis does to al gore  s movie and the whole   global warming   scam             a lovely little film about the introduction of motion pictures to china  captures the amazement of film  s first audiences pretty much as it  s described to have been worldwide  and uses actual lumiere films for most of the actualities  i don  t agree with other people about bad acting on the british fellow  s part   i thought he was fine  but the chinese lead really stole the show  in any case  i found myself with a smile on my face through most of the movie  people who fear subtitles might note that a lot of the film is in english  which for some reason is given subtitles as well as the chinese on the dvd              sigh  i  m baffled when i see a short like this get attention and assignments and whatnot  i saw this film at a festival before the filmmaker got any attention and forgot about it immediately afterwards  it was mildly annoying to see it swiping the grinch who stole christmas heart gag along with the narration  the set design seen many times before  the whole weak tim burton ish style  and the story that goes nowhere  and we got the   joke   about shooting the crows with the    the first time  alright  br    br   but i guess what  s really unacceptable is that it even swipes its basic concept from a comic book circa      called lenore  the cute little dead girl by roman dirge  as any quick internet search will reveal  i mean  what is this  this is what they base a hollywood contract on and opens doors in canada for a filmmaker    give your head a shake   as don cherry might say             cute idea    salesgirl linda smith  yolande donlan  inherits a teeny tiny little county of lampidorra  that country  which wasn  t even in north america  was made the   th state     of course  there were only    states at the time  since this was made in          linda travels to the country she has inherited  and we follow her along as she tries to figure out what to do with this strange country and its even quirkier people  at one point  she sings a song that she claims is from her people the navajo  and it gets ever more sillier from there     although yolande donlan  s heavy lipstick and omni present smile never get ruffled or shmeared  there are other songs scattered through out as the citizens sing to welcome their new princess  filmed in a glorious british version of technicolor  or some such equivalent  about the only big name here is dirk bogarde as british subject tony craig  cheese vendor  bogarde made a big splash in the uk film industry after serving in the war  and was even knighted by qe ii  craig and   the new princess   keep bumping into each other  and their adventures become more intertwined as lampidorra  s financial problems worsen    fun little farce    along the lines of marx brothers film  also note that donlan later married val guest  the writer and director of our little project  and stayed married for    years  guest was better known for writing and directing his sci fi flicks  in both the uk   the us             back in      a little film called making love shocked audiences with its frank and open depiction of a romantic love story that just happened to be about two men  br    br   i have been waiting for years for a good  old fashioned romance between two men  latter days is all that and more  br    br   yes  it is soapy  melodramatic  clich   ridden  and quite corny  that is what makes it so wonderful  there is nothing like a good romantic movie  and this movie is romantic in the best sense of the word  br    br   as to the issue of religion  sorry folks  but these things do happen and are happening to gay people even now  it is not just the mormon church that rejects its gay members  gay people in every religion have faced harsh judgment and rejection  br    br   i loved this movie  it has a perfect blend of a fantasy romance grounded in the reality of the day to day lives of the characters  if i could give it more than ten stars i would  good love stories never go out of style  great love stories like latter days are unforgettable  br    br   it  s about time             the concept of having laurel   hardy this time in the role of chimney sweepers works out surprisingly hilarious  it guarantees some funny situations and silly antics  from especially stan laurel of course as usual  br    br   the movie also has a subplot with a nutty professor who is working on a rejuvenation formula  it doesn  t really sound like a logical mix of story lines and incoherent but both plot lines blend in perfectly toward the memorable ending  it  s still a bit weird but its funny nevertheless  so it works for the movie  br    br   the supporting cast of the movie is surprising good  sam adams is great as the stereotypical butler and lucien littlefield goes deliciously over the top as the nutty professor  br    br   the movie is filled with some excellent timed and hilarious constructed sequences  which are all quite predictable but become hilarious to watch nevertheless thanks to the way they are all executed  it all helps to make   dirty work   to be one of the better laurel   hardy shorts  br    br                   this movie came as a huge disappointment  the anime series ended with a relatively stupid plot twist and the rushed introduction of a pretty lame villain  but i expected shamballa to tie up all the loose ends  unfortunately  it didn  t  it added more plot holes than it resolved  and confused more than it clarified  the animation and voice acting were great  but with an idiotic plot  dull setting  most of the movie doesn  t even take place in dull wwii earth rather than the alchemy world   and disappointing ending  ed is useless for the rest of his days in a world with no alchemy  and he ditches winry    it was altogether pretty lackluster  do yourself a favor   disregard the last half of the anime as well as this movie  and read the manga             maybe i loved this movie so much in part because i  ve been feeling down in the dumps and it  s such a lovely little fairytale  whatever the reason  i thought it was pitch perfect  great  intelligent story  beautiful effects  excellent acting  especially de niro  who is awesome   this movie made me happier than i  ve been for a while  br    br   it is a very funny and clever movie  the running joke of the kingdom  s history of prince savagery and the aftermath  the way indulging in magic effects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled  that  s much of what makes it so good  it  s an elaborate  special effects laden movie with more story than most fairytale movies  yet there is an incredible attention to small things  br    br   i feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again             i was surprised that    forgiving the franklins    did not generate more buzz at this years sundance film festival  there were times that the laughter at the screening i saw was so loud that you could barely hear the movie  the movie has some excellent acting and a story that really makes one examine broader issues   you know little issues like religion  sex and the truth  lots of comedy  s seem to rely on the same old corny contrived situations  many leave you thinking    i know they ripped this off from some sitcom     this film takes off on its own unique direction   i really think that jay floyd did a fantastic job with a tight budget on this film             they must issue this plot outline to all wannabe filmmakers arriving at the hollywood bus station  they then fill in the blanks and set their story in whatever hick town or urban ghetto from which they just arrived  you know exactly what this movie is about from the opening shot  four young boys playing in grainy slow motion  accompanied by voice over narration  next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four young boys playing in grainy slow motion  once they  re grown  it  s easy to spot the writer director among the four  he  s the quiet  contemplative  long haired one who is never seen without his composition book tucked in his pants  this means that his superb writing talent will be his ticket from hickville to hollywood  only there  s no writing  or directing talent on display here  and if you still can  t figure out which one he is  here  s a hint  the auteur and his character have the same middle name  it took over an hour to figure out that these twenty something men were supposed to still be in high school  what looked like a prison was apparently a high school  the warden turned out to be the principal  once more  the poor  misunderstood rebel can pound everyone in the movie into the pavement  murder and pillage  but is powerless to stand up to his alcoholic father  how about hitting back  kid  like you do everyone else  numerous fist fight scenes for no apparent purpose  howlingly bad dialogue  many scenes badly out of focus  cartoon characters keep popping up as bit players and extras  drawing unintentional laughs from the premiere audience  overacting in the extreme  and if you don  t quite get the self important speeches  or the slow motion scenes  just listen to the overbearing music  it will clue you in and what you  re supposed to feel  poor marisa ryan must be racking up lots of frequent flier mileage as she travels around the country working in these amateur regional films  the biggest sin is that the audience is supposed to feel sympathy for kids who gun down old ladies  run over puppies chained to a tree  rob and steal  all the while complaining about their sad  sorry lives  but if only we could get out of this hick town and go to college  yeah  that  s the ticket  why is it that every twenty something filmmaker believes that his life so far is so important  so interesting  that the world can  t wait to see it onscreen  if this movie is as autobiographical as it seems  then the auteur better be looking over his shoulder for policemen bearing fugitive warrants             i watched this movie so that you don  t have to  i have great respect for kris kristofferson  but what was he thinking  he did this for scale   br    br   at least the film  s title practices truth in advertising  since people and objects routinely disappear throughout the film  adding to the confusion  kristofferson mentions this in his commentary that even he wasn  t sure if genevieve bujold  s character really existed  this does not bode well for the viewer being able to follow the story  br    br   the   making of   feature was far more interesting than the movie itself  it explores the difficulty cobbling together funding for an indie  even as the film is being shot  br    br   to it  s credit  this movie is visually pleasing and doesn  t in any way look like a movie made with just slightly over  m  too bad the money wasn  t spent on a better project             just saw this movie on opening night  i read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it    i must say  i was not impressed  i  m so unimpressed that i feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money  br    br   first of all   the messengers   is very predictable  and just not much of a thriller  it might be scary for someone under     but it really did nothing for me  the climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie  s resolution  br    br   furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial  some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub par suspense scenes  br    br   if you  ve seen previews for this movie  then you  ve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot  this movie is not worth seeing in the theaters             i went to see this movie  actually i went to see family portraits  which contains cutting moments     other short films by douglas buck  at the mar del plata festival  argentina     i just couldn  t watch it  i had to cover my eyes after the  st half of cutting moments and take a peek every once in a while  by the time it was over  my stomach was upside down and i felt light headed  i just had to leave the cinema a few minutes after the  nd short begun  btw  of course i was not the only one who left the room   it was waaaay too violent and disgusting for me  i am impressed by the many brave people who actually loved it  i just don  t get how you can love that kind of movies  the shocking and bloody and horrible images i saw got really stuck in my head for like two days   i also try to analyze the story  my boyfriend did see the whole thing and told me about it  and i just don  t think it makes any sense  i mean  that amount of violence and stuff  makes no other sense than to try to shock people  and that  s not a good enough reason  i think  there  s absolutely nothing in this movie that i can say   well  at least   x   thing about it was good    but well  i guess i will never understand that kind of films             a well made run of the mill movie with a tragic ending  pluses  the way the story moves   begins with soorya struggling to live followed by a long flashback about why he  s there  the music  a disinterested look at the life of policemen  minuses  the violence and the gore  but i guess they add to the realistic effects  still  having people  s heads chopped off and sent in boxes and sacks could have been avoided  br    br   no complaints                   i don  t understand the positive comments made about this film  it is cheap and nasty on all levels and i cannot understand how it ever got made  br    br   cartoon characters abound   sue  s foul mouthed  alcoholic  layabout  irish father being a prime example  none of the characters are remotely sympathetic   except  briefly  for sue  s asian boyfriend but even he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence  as desperately unattractive as they both are  i  ve no idea why either rita and or sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like bob   but given that they do  why should i be expected to care what happens to them  so many reviews keep carping on about how   realistic   it is  if that is true  it is a sad reflection on society but no reason to put it on film  br    br   i didn  t like the film at all            steven what have you done you have hit an all new low  it is weird since steven s last film shadow man was directed by the same director who did this trash  shadow man was good this was diabolically bad so bad it wasn t even funny steven is hardly in the movie and feels like he is in a cameo appearance and when he is in the film he is dubbed half the time anyway  as for the action well let s just say the wizard of oz had more action than this trash there is hardly any action in the film and when it does finally arrive it is boring depressing badly shot so called action scenes  seagal hardly kills anyone unlike his over films where he goes one man army ie under siege   and   and exit wounds  the plot is so confusing with so many plot holes that it doesn t make scenes sometimes  flight of fury better be good what a shame i wasted   pounds on this garbage   out of ten better luck next time           a call girl witnesses a murder and becomes the killer  s next target  director brian de palma is really on a pretentious roll here  his camera swoops around corners in a museum  after lingering a long time over a painting of an ape   divvies up into split screen for arty purposes  practically gives away his plot with a sequence  again in split screen  where two characters are both watching a tv program about transsexuals  and stages his  first  finale during a thunderous rainstorm    dressed to kill   is exhausting  primarily because it asks us to swallow so much and gives back nothing substantial  much of the acting  with the exception of young keith gordon  is mediocre and the  second  finale is a rip off of de palma  s own   carrie    not to mention   psycho    the explanation of the dirty deeds plays like a spoof of hitchcock  not an homage  stylish in a steely cold way  the end results are distinctly half baked     from

this second cooperation is even better than the first  br    br   a must for psychological thriller horror buds and metaphor lovers  this story is about forgiveness and righting of past wrongs   this is one of the minor classics from the     s that get respect even today  like the mention by rebecca gayheart in   scream     or the tru calling episode which used the movie  s premise  br    br   flatliners                   one of my favorite shows back in the     s  as i recall it went to air on friday  or possibly saturday night on the nine network     here in australia  darren mcgavin and simon oakland were great together  br    br   each episode usually reached a climax with kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent  to their credit  the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible  br    br   i remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient indian chief which who   came back   as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital  the final showdown saw kolchack trying to short circuit the   power beast   amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames  oh well      you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea  br    br   mcgavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best  br    br   definitely deserves a place in tv  s   hall of fame    to quote tony vincenzo        kolchack you are on it       or  in the case of the hall of fame   in it                i think my summary says it all  this mtv ish answer to the classic candid camera tv show features a gen x  or is that gen y  type putting in false choppers and wearing various hats and wigs and glasses  and setting people up in fairly outlandish although often not very interesting situations  example  kennedy has a guy invite his parents to his   wedding    kennedy is the bride  done up in a full bridal gown and long wig  the   joke   is that the parents immediately understand their son is marrying a man who claims to no longer have his   bits and pieces    problem is  this schtick goes on way too long  obviously to fill out time  and kennedy is about as funny as a dead cod lying in the sun  candid camera would have run three or four scenarios in the time it took kennedy to get through this one  running around  constantly asking   do i look fat    i recognize the show was not made for me  it was made for    year old pinheads who think jackass is the height of comedy today  so let them laugh  thank god the show was short lived             frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time  and just at the moment you realize you shouldn  t be laughing  you  ve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness  and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide open mouths and glazen eyes  you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and    well  you get the point  br    br   but for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face  frownland  really is a remarkable piece of work that  after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps  makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time  you feel sickenly sorry for him  br    br   it would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of ronald bronstein  s film  but for some insane reason  i felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer  if someone sets you on fire  you typically want to put it out  stop  drop  and roll  but with this film  you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body  you endure the pain  perhaps out of spite  or some unknown masochistic curiosity i can  t even begin to attempt to explain  br    br   unfortunately  mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you  but if you get a chance to catch it  prepare yourself  bring a doggie bag             i saw this movie while surfing through infomercials and late night     s sitcoms on tv one night at   in the morning  i must say  i didn  t expect much  and i didn  t get much  although rose mcgowan is hot  her performance and the performance of the rest of the cast was not oscar worthy  to say the least  this movie has its ups and downs  and does have a nice couple of twists at the end  but in all honesty it was awful  not even a typical slasher movie  no gore  no sex  no nudity  no real violence  just bad acting  i  d give it a   out of                i first saw this film when i was about   years old on tv in the uk  where it was called   laupta  the flying island     i absolutely loved it  and was heartbroken when it was repeated a while later and i missed it  i was enchanted by the story and characters  but most of all by the haunting and beautiful music  it would have been the original english dubbed version which i saw   sometimes erroneously referred to as the   streamline dub    the dub was actually by ghibli themselves and only distributed by streamline  which is sadly unavailable except as part of a ridiculously expensive laser disc box set  br    br   unfortunately i feel that the release has been partly spoiled by disney  the voice acting is ok but the dialogue doesn  t have the same raw energy that the   streamline   dub or the original japanese had  and i think james van der beek sounds too old to play the lead  they have made some pointless alterations  such as changing the main character  s name from   pazu   to   patzu    and added some dialogue  but worst of all i feel that they have ruined many scenes with intrusive music   the opening scene of the airships for example was originally silent but has been spoiled thanks to disney  s moronic requirement that there be music playing whenever anyone is not speaking  which i find annoying in many disney films  br    br   this film still blows away most recent animated films  and i cannot recommend it highly enough  the plot is simple yet captivating and the film shows a flair which is sadly missing from most modern mass market  homogenized animation             this film can  t make up its mind whether its message is   humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless   or   don  t ever go in the water again    a fisherman  nolan  is out to nab a killer whale  a very bad thing  but when he accidentally  accidentally mark you  hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate  the cow    and i use the word in all senses    who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece    throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself   i doubt it was her first   when her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds  her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt  kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to nolan  obviously as among humans  total psychos date other total psychos  br    br   the film reeks of half thought out anti human message    the poor poor whale   the evil men must suffer and die    and yet  it does not succeed in demonizing nolan at all  it  s true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel  but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and  as the film progresses  he grows more and more compassionate to the whale  s pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale  just to make it feel a little better  br    br   the films final journey  in which nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north  reminds me of melville  s eerie man whale connection  and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion  where these two husbands might connect  understand even respect each other in their own grief  for nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident  it  s clear nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss  however  it never goes there  the whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone  br    br   the final scene loses this focus and becomes jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and nolan and no doubt through an oversight  fails to chomp up the whale hugger  tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier   i love animals  and i detest whaling  and what is more i love orca whales  but if this film  s goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed  nolan shows compassion and growth  and feels for others  and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming  br    br   the only message one can walk away with is   if you see an orca whale  ever  anywhere  run the other way cause if you step on his fin the wrong way  he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you               why  o   why     did i pick this one up  well    i needed a no brainer in the summer heat  and the cover looked cool  br    br   of course i should  ve known better  this is a really  really bad movie  and it gets embarasing when the makers know it  s bad  and try cover it up by adding some sexy beautiful women  and some sex scenes to it  well  folks    it does  nt cut it  does it  br    br   if you would like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very  very good  well played and funny  go rent lake placid   that is an order             only a very small child could overlook the absurdities in this bomb  the first difficulty faced by the submarine   seaview   is what appear to be chunks of  rock  falling down through the water and crashing into its hull  but it  s not rock  they  re under the north pole  it is ice  everybody  except possibly hitherto mentioned small children  and even some of them  know that ice floats  br    br   then  disaster strikes  that darn van allen radiation belt around the earth catches fire  no one knows how this happened  we are told  which is understandable  because it is utterly impossible for radiation to   catch fire    and even if it could  there is no air in space for it to burn  br    br   there is literally no good reason to overlook science concepts basic to  nd grade school textbooks when making a film  however  irwin allen manages to do it again and again  perhaps we are meant to focus on the   people   instead  which is pretty easy  as they are cardboard  br    br   the cast tries very hard not to look embarrassed in this ridiculous sub kiddie romp  much like later episodes of his   lost in space   tv series  the concept of which was swiped outright from writer ib melchior and then rushed into production  br    br   the sub looks pretty good  though  which is why this one gets a                   our teacher showed us this movie in first grade  i haven  t seen it since  i just watched the trailer though  does this look like a first grade movie to you  i don  t think so  i was so horrified by this movie  i could barely watch it  it was mainly the scene with shirley mcclain cutting that little girl in half  and then there was the boy with ketchup  i was freaked out by this film  now today  being     i probably would not feel that way  i just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children shouldn  t see this movie  even though it  s pg  be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids  i don  t even remember what it was about  once was enough             a plot that fizzled and reeked of irreconcilable differences in opinions constituted a judgmental havoc with one side pro life and the other a destroyer of a demon  s seed  the horror was left out and replaced with an overall dull effect quite possibly meant to be horrific  but  instead demonstrated an ill dose of beliefs which ridiculed each other to death  despite the title itself  being a fan of masters of horror since the beginning  this ridiculous plot twist with it  s sordid depictions crashed apart like a spindly old rocking chair after being sat upon  i view this episode as being thrown together from the get go  never really taking off anywhere other than to see it through for what its worth and relieved when it finally came to   the end                scott menville is not casey kasem  that is the first  most important  and most disturbing thing about this attempt at re imagining scooby doo and company  br    br   shaggy  s voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the scooby shows  they  ve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the original  br    br   i  m not sure what they  re on about yet with the villain angle  but it surely isn  t following the formula used in any of the previous scooby shows  br    br   and the animation style is very bizarre and distorted  i like it  but it  s not real scooby doo type animation  but the weird animation used for other wb shows grew on me  this might  too  br    br   it  s worth a glance at    once    if you can handle the lack of proper shaggy voice  that right there is enough to jar one out of enjoying the show properly  besides  i am trying not to be an inflexible  nitpicking fan  evolve or die  as the saying goes  we  ll see how it looks after two more episodes    by then i  ll have formed a much more solid opinion             i often wonder how movies like this even get made  and the most shocking part is that people actually pay to watch them  br    br   with aksar it appears as though the director made up the story as he went along  adding twists and turns when he liked  no matter how ludicrous they were  the script was non existent with inane dialogs such as   jo sheena roy pehenti hai  wahee fashion hota hai   and   yeh versace hai madam    yeah right   br    br   every one of the characters was shallow and underdeveloped  acting was awful  constumes  lycra for udita and awful suits for a stocky emran   locales  the numerous houses that were used for interiors did not even vaguely resemble a victorian mansion   screenplay etc etc  just one word  rubbish  br    br   for those people who love hashmi and his movies  watch it  as for me  i  ll never get those two and a half hours back  the only redeeming factor was some of the music which was decent            this movie is an amazing comedy   the script is too funny   if u watch it more than once you will enjoy it more  though the comedy at times is silly but it really makes u laugh   salman khan and aamir khan have given justice to their roles  after      i have not come across any hindi movie which was as funny as this            even this early in his career  capra was quite accomplished with his camera work and his timing  this is a thin story    and quite predictable at times    but he gets very good performances out of his cast and has some rather intricate camera moves that involve the viewer intimately  the first part looks like a cinderella story  though anyone with brains can see that the bottom will fall out of that    the rich   prince   will lose his fortune  br    br   nonetheless  because of his good cast and fast pace  it  s easy to get caught up in the clich  s  then the movie does become more original  as the married couple have to find a way to make a living  the ending is very predictable but satisfying  i also want to compliment the title writing  very witty and fun             uwe boll slips back in his film making skills once again to offer up a scifi horror tale of mercenaries and reporters taking on super soldiers on a remote island  an okay cast headed by the excellent udo keir is cast adrift by boll who makes the worst of script that should have worked  the mad scientist being investigated by a reporter has been done to death but this script is amusing enough that the plot should have worked  additionally the effects and super soldier design with their dead lifeless eyes have some degree of creepiness  however boll somehow manages to film everything in an off handed way  its as if he couldn  t be bothered to actually figure out what would work and instead rattled off stock camera placements and walked away  additionally the assembly of scenes has no spark or life  i  m guessing that boll only shot one or two takes and just used what he had  it really stinks  clearly boll is in one of his periodic retrograde films where anything he  s ever learned about film gets flushed  the last film he made that was this bad was seed a serial killer movie that is one of the worst films i  ve ever seen  this isn  t that bad  but it is close simply because it should have been better  then again udo keir is good enough that he does make watching his scenes worth the effort and make this a an almost so bad its good film  i  d take a pass unless it  s late at night and you  re catching it on cable             this video is so hilariously funny  it makes everything else br    br   by eddie murphy seem very disappointing  even beverly hills cop and the nutty professor  which just goes to show you how good this really is   to be honest  i don  t think that i  ve ever br    br   laughed at something as much as this  including naked gun and the rarely seen bargearse  this show is amazing  although it must be said that it is certainly filled with the word beginning with f that is four letters long  plus its extended version beginning with m  but it didn  t bother me  see it  the funniest thing i  ve ever seen and probably the funniest you ever have too             this film is dreadful  it has absolutely zero laughs  hebrew hammer  adam goldberg  sets out to save hannukah from evil santa  andy dick   perhaps a promising enough basis for a plot  in actual fact the film does not progress beyond this premise  while there are some  far and few  nice touches and the plot is relatively coherent  it is laboured  hackneyed and ultimately  mindlessly boring  this despite the fact that goldberg  dick and greer  hammer  s client love interest  all have quite considerable screen presence  despite being played for what might be described as whacky over the top gags  this film is consistently middle class middle of the road muck  do not waste    minutes of your life on this   note  the music was good                it  s amazing that such a cliche ridden yuppie angst film actually got made in the first place  the characters are so weak  and the acting so uninspired  that it  s impossible to care about any of them   especially brooke shields  the temptation to fast forward through the slow parts is almost irresistible  if you like this genre  you  d be better off renting   singles    or   bodies  rest   motion               i never watched the   next action hero   show  and until reading the other comments here  did not know that this movie was the   prize   from that competition  i was just flipping channels and came across this  and found myself watching  dare eagerly  all the way to the end  br    br   yes  the plot  s been done  the most dangerous game  etc   but i was hoping for  and almost received  the   gotcha     how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end  i think the high tech was overdone  gps  s  and gave me cold sweat flashbacks of night rider  but it nevertheless was not too overdone  br    br   the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod  suspension of disbelief  that was required of the viewer  do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate  could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up  pleeease  way too much of that type of thing   fun to watch  but keep it at least plausible  thank you very much  br    br   the final solution was good  but the ending was disappointing  with the after taste of a bad star trek episode  at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy   except for zane  who doesn  t get near as much work as he deserves imho   they were winners from a reality show  br    br   knock me out             i am a big fan of old horror movies  and since i am middle aged  old to me is a movie made before      with most being made in the       s to       s period  i am not a big fan of more modern horror movies  with one exception being creepshow    which i thought was great  i could reminisce about the stories there but i really really enjoyed the monster in the box story with hal holbrook  and also the one about the really clean guy was a great ending  all the stories were great though  so why did i like them so much  the characters had some decent development  the lines were very plain about who was good and who was bad  the horror bits were heightened with a close up of a face aghast with fear  and the funny bits were really funny  this sequel is either greatly lacking of these elements or they are totally absent  i am writing this only having watched it partially because the movie was a complete waste of time and i turned it off to do other things like write movie reviews on imdb com  lol  when george kennedy and an old dorothy lamoure get top billing it  s telling you something       of     also  romero  s expertise is hard to find here  they must had told him to tone it down to a pg standard  i don  t know what this was rated at but it looks pg to me   and that  s not a good thing for a movie with nothing else going on  it  s shown on the encore cable channel if your dieing  yuck yuck  to see it             i just wanted to say that  i love gheorghe muresan  so i automatically loved this movie  everything else about it was so so    billy crystal is a good actor  even if he is annoying  but the thing that made this movie was  at least  for a basketball fan  seeing gheorghe muresan act             i thought that this movie was incredible  i absolutely loved it  even though my brothers didn  t that much  the special effects were outstanding  and this movie is about my favorite sport  golf  the only thing that was disappointing about this amazing movie is that it is hard to watch two times or more in a row  this movie just absolutely tops everything else i have ever seen  it was everything i would expect out of a movie  i just loved it  also  it was pretty kid friendly  this movie helped me realize that when you put your mind to it  anything is possible  i would give it a pure        it was better than the legend of baggar vants  and the two pirates of the caribbean movies combined  absolutely amazing  loved it             this is a funny film and i like it a lot  cary elwes plays robin hood to a tee  this is  of course  the usual good vs evil with robin against the evil sheriff of nottingham  the humor is sort of in your face stuff for the most part  but still works well  a comedy for a night when you don  t want to have to think much  it  s well worth a rent             some here have commented that this is the worst elvis movie ever made  well  they are only partly right  for me  this is the worst movie ever made period  i have never seen anything so basely crude  and insulting  and vile  and against human nature as this film  a true embarrassment to the motion picture industry  this isn  t even so bad  its good  there is no campy trashy fun to be had here like in some of elvis   other bad movies like clambake  this one is so rotten to sit through its painful  pure garbage  native americans should sue for their poor clich  d and stereotypical treatment here  actually  perhaps all human beings should sue for the crime and disservice this movie does to the species as a whole   stars  seriously  grade  f            first of all yes i  m white  so i try to tread lightly in the ever delicate subject of race    anyway    white people hating black people   bad but black people hating white people   ok  because apparently we deserved it     where do i start  i wish i had something good to say about this movie aside unintended comedy scenes  the infamous scene were ice cube and co  get in a fight with some really big  really strong  really really angry and scary looking neo nazis and win    the neo nazi where twice the size     and the chase  the chase is priceless    this is not a movie about race  tolerance and understanding  it doesn  t deliver    this is a racist movie that re affirm all the clich   stereotypes  the white wimpy guy who gets manhandled by his black roommate automatically transform in a skinhead   cmon simply awful i do regret ever seeing it  br    br   save your time and the dreadful experience of a poorly written  poorly acted  dull and clearly biased picture  if you are into the subject  go and rent american history x  now thats a movie            donald pleasance and peter cushing united in one horror film  that always sounds like a terrific plan  two of the most versatile cult actors of their generation  who previously already starred together in terrific genre outings like   the flesh and the fiends   and   from beyond the grave    pairing up in a mid     s satanic themed exploitation flick  how can this possibly go wrong  well  unfortunately  it can  to my deepest regret   land of the minotaur   can hardly even be called mediocre  and that in spite of the cast  the exotic setting  the appealing title and the potentially great sounding premise  in a remote little area in greece  more particularly near an archaeological site  multiple tourists vanish because baron peter cushing and his docile followers keep feeding them to a fire breathing minotaur statue  cushing  who never looked more bored and uninterested in any role he played before  owns a giant medieval castle and apparently in greek this means you also own the complementary archaeological ruins and an underground network of caverns  that is of course quite handy if your hobby is the kidnapping of random campers and amateur archaeologists  when three of his young friends also mysteriously disappear in the same area  father roch   the priest of a couple of towns before    decides to investigate    land of the minotaur   is a boring and extremely slow paced horror effort that never really undertakes any major attempts to generate a satanic atmosphere and doesn  t bother to elaborate on all the potentially fascinating elements and pagan trivia details  the titular minotaur  for example  is an intriguing creature of greek mythology with the head of a bull and the body of a person  but for some inexplicable reason the script never deepens out the significance  instead  the film focuses on tedious and overly talkative sequences and loud inappropriate music altered with experimental noises  the only reason to even consider giving this major disappointment of a film a chance is because of donald pleasance  his portrayal of rude  bossy and old fashioned priest who criticizes everything that represents modern youth is powerful and reliable as always             the three shorts included on this compilation issued in      are timeless chaplin classics  nothing wrong with them and nothing to criticize either  chaplin  s score for these films and the framework added as bridging sections between the shorts are also well done  the problem with this compilation is a minor one  yet annoying  the shorts have been stretch printed to fit the    frame p s  speed of contemporary films whereas the shorts themselves where shot at    frames p s  this results is jerky motion that doesn  t look very attractive  and yet this was an excusable solution given the limitations of optical printing technology at the time  it  s just not excusable that the current dvd version is unrestored  the films look dirty as they did in      and are still stretch printed  there are separate restored versions of these classics available  even on dvd  and it would not be a problem to restore the image  but alas this has not been done  br    br   a minor quibble has taken up a lot of space in my article  but i say again a minor quibble  it should not detract all that much from the experience although it detracted one point from my rating  the shorts are still worth                          s tourist trap is a clever  unique b thriller that stands out as one of the best of it  s kind  br    br   travellers stop at a lonely wax museum where the owner  s mannequins are a little too life like for comfort  br    br   while the film has hints of the texas chainsaw massacre  tourist trap is mainly a creepy psychological thriller worthy of the twilight zone  director david schmoeller gives this movie an atmosphere of darkness and mystery  that reaches nightmarish proportions  also  schmoelloer adds the occasional touch of comic relief to the bizarre happenings  br    br   venteran actor chuck connors is the best of the film  s decent cast  pino donaggio  s music score is excellent  having both lyrical and solemn themes that are perfect to the movie  a number of the film  s sequences are quite memorable  br    br   for horror and thriller fans alike  tourist trap is an unforgettable must see film  br    br           out of                 years ago i saw the godfather and it made a lasting impression on me  the atmosphere of the movie was first class  the acting memorable and the storyline a classic  recently i bought the trilogy and after watching part   again i looked eagerly to viewing part         i was so pleased to realize early on into part   that here was a fitting follow on to the great godfather movie  again everything was just about perfect and i could not wait to see godfather iii          wrong   i wish i  d stopped at ii  the storyline was not good  it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story  the characters were weak especially the daughter  pacino  s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in godfather   or    then scenes such as  corleone being invested with all the trappings of the catholic church with full choir  the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset  the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting  where the   goodies   get away and everyone else is shot  daughter and  st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board  the pathetic shooting on the steps       corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes  a man of his intelligence and guile isn  t ready for an emergency      no it was not good and with the best will in the world i wont be able to watch it again  but i  ll watch       many times down the years             this little two person movie is actually much bigger than it looks  it has so many layers  i  ve watched it over and over  and always pick up on something new  i am amazed at the depth of the acting  and i feel if this movie had gotten wider release that there would be no question that alan rickman is a major star            uk newspaper reviews seem to have concentrated on the fact that the reviewers tend to know toby young  the journalist on whose real life experiences this movie is based  the key word here is   based    how to lose friends is a fictitious romcom  br    br   sidney young joins a prestigious gossip magazine in new york  where he proceeds to make gaffe after gaffe before finally getting it right and making it  this involves him selling out  and the movie has some serious points to make about journalistic integrity  however  they are not overdone  the main substance remains a comedy which centres around sidney  s misadventures  the script has its cake and eats it in that sidney is a stupid  well meaning buffoon at the same time as being a smart  moderately obnoxious skilled writer  this contradiction is never that much of an issue  because simon pegg  as sidney  projects likability too well  br    br   jeff bridges underplays sidney  s editor a little too effectively  and kirsten dunst is rather anonymous as the conflicted eventual object of sidney  s affections and  with regard to megan fox  who plays an airhead bimbo starlet   i can say only this  just say the word  miss fox  and i will leave my wife  sell all my belongings  and buy myself a plane ticket in order to take my place at your side as your consort  of course  given that i  m a fat    year old english accountant  you might not find my offer too enticing  but it  s there on the table anyway  given how short her career has been so far  one might think it is a little too soon for megan fox to take on a role which mercilessly lampoons the sort of actress she might be thought to become  however  she does it sweetly  with some skill  and extremely sexily  this girl will go far  br    br   there is stalwart support from a variety of seasoned performers   miriam margolyes and bill paterson from the uk  gillian anderson and danny huston from the us  br    br   there are several laugh out loud moments  and i smiled most of the way through  as ever  the f word makes appearances when it really doesn  t need to  although at least a couple of these are very funny             alien hunter    out of     is it me or does every movie that starts in roswell  new mexico suck  take alien mixed with the thing  mixed with contact  mixed with of all things on the beach  the andromeda strain  the classroom scene from raiders of the lost ark and a throw in a little stargate to boot   br    br   derivative doesn  t even begin to describe this movie  of course with nothing original plot wise they amp up the gore and sex right  nope gore is a blink and you miss it affair and sex is all tease   james spader causally mentions he needs a shower and the delectable leslie stefanson asks to join him    he turns her down  aggh    br    br   in fact if a movie ever needed a shower scene to liven things up this is it  i mean if your going to have impossibly good looking women in white bathing suits wandering around an antarctica research base why not go for broke  br    br   with about    seconds of actual thrill in the entire movie alien hunter is remarkable serious and slow going for a sci fi adventure  needed a much better plot twist to liven it up and by the way the alien itself is a horribly clich  d artifice and has virtually no screen time for someone who shares half the title   br    br   i also inquired during viewing what is with the children of the corn in space motif   note that since jason of friday the   th fame  pinhead from hellraiser and that leprechaun have all traveled to space to slay nubile teenagers why not the cornfield   the characters in the cornfield dress like logan  s run extras and i was just waiting for the stalks to come alive and attack them  br    br   that however would have been exciting and apparently against this movies covenant  the acting is mostly fine as spader reprises his stargate role while stefanson and janine eser model the latest in antarctic beachwear  john lynch however read the whole script and acts the like the insane bad guy well before the story would indicate it  br    br   alien hunter is a disappointing derivative slog that makes me pine for a proper children of the corn in space movie             i have a hard time putting into words just how wonderful this was  once in a while you see a film that just sticks with you    you are alone   is that movie  for me   the film is constantly in my head and in my heart  i replay the scenes mentally every day and analyze them and go through the emotions all over again  as if i am seeing it for the first time  br    br   there is nothing i did not like about the movie  amazing soundtrack    the ending was perfect  very emotionally stirring    it was compelling and riveting  br    br   i adored jessica bohl and her performance was the greatest i have ever witnessed  i admired brittany  s strength  what a strong woman   br    br   the tag line is   when your darkest moments come to life    we never know what we are capable of doing  everyone says oh i would never do that  when really we have no idea what we would do in a situation  we are very capable of anything and this movies delves straight into that subject  the honesty of the movie may be my absolute favorite part  br    br   thank you gorman becherd for a perfect piece of art                i love this young people trapped in a house of horrors movie  not just because i  m a huge linnea quigley jill terashita fan  but because it is a lot of fun and actually scary at times  br    br   the special effects are awesome  especially linnea  s scene with the lipstick and towards the end when almost everyone is dead and possessed  br    br   plenty of nudity provided by linnea and jill  plenty of humor  cool soundtrack  high body count  etc   by the way  if you have never seen this one  try and buy watch the unrated version which has more gore and some scenes the rated version is missing             i saw the film and i got screwed  because the film was foolish and boring  i thought ram gopal varma will justify his work but unfortunately he failed and the whole film got spoiled and they spoiled   sholay    the cast and crew was bad  the whole theater slept while watching the movie some people ran away in the middle  amithab bachan  s acting is poor  i thought this movie will be greatest hit of the year but this film will be the greatest flop of the year sure  nobody did justice to their work  including ajay devagan  this film don  t deserve any audiences  i bet that this film will flop   br    br     finally this movie sucks              lorna green janine reynaud is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club  she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon  it  s quite possible that  through a form of hypnotic suggestion  someone   a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love making is about to begin  after the murders within her fantasies are committed  lorna awakens bewildered  often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality  br    br   if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco  i  d say it  s elegant   difficult  by now  you  ve probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about  since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream  franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career  as far as film making style  and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience  and  as you read from the reaction of the user comments here  some like this decision  others find the style labouring  dull  and bewildering  i  ll be the first to admit that the film is over my head  but even franco himself  when quizzed by critics who watched   succubus    admitted that he didn  t even understand the film and he directed it  some might say that   succubus   was merely a precursor to his more admired work    venus in furs    considered his masterwork by franco faithful  because it also adopts the surreal  dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn  t truly know whether he she is experiencing something real or imagined  in a sense  like the protagonist  we are experiencing the same type of confusion  certainly    succubus   is unconventional film making where we aren  t given the keys to what is exactly going on  and  a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn  t help matters    succubus   is also populated by beatnik types and   poet speak    corman  s film    a bucket of blood   poked fun at  my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party  quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually  great locations and jazz score  i liked this film myself  although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction  loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna  a wee bit drunk  writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig   equally wasted rush her in an embrace of kisses             this outing of knotts includes one of his best sidekicks ever  frank welker  welker makes the film  knotts and welker compete for the laughs and both receive plenty  knotts works for a small   no where   town where the city is being run by some of the most ignorant officials  when things go wrong the city fathers  allow knotts to take the fall  frank welker  s character befriends knotts and together they stumble together to clear up the mess and knott  s good name  this film shows the usual knott  s scared to death character that made him famous for years on television and film  this may have been knotts   last good outing  when you have an extra    minutes  get a good old fashioned laugh a great icon  don knotts             emma is a horribly flawed film based on jane austens classic novel  i have not read the book so i really didn  t know that much about the plot  and yet i still predicted nearly the entire plot  there were also many scenes that frustrated me because of the bad writing or directing  the film is though for some reason very entertaining and i loved it  of course there were all the scenes i disliked but the majority was well acted and funny  gwyneth paltrow gives one of her best performances as the heroine in emma  the film also stars toni collette who has okay but has been much better  ewan mecgreger who has also been better but he is still very good here  alan cumming who i have never really been impressed with and is pretty much the same here  and jeremy northam who  s performance is rather wooden at first look but actually fairly subtle  even if that was not what it needed  there have been much better adaptations of jane austen books but this one is still very entertaining and worth watching             why do i hate this  let me list the ways  br    br   i have nothing against mary pickford but a    year old woman playing a    year old is just stupid  br    br   there  s a fight scene in which kids are throwing bricks at each other and it  s considered funny   and it goes on for    minutes  br    br   strange how none of the kids are even remotely hurt br    br   the title cards contain plenty of racial and ethnic slurs br    br   for a   family   film the fights were way too violent  loved it when pickford was punching it out with a little boy   and the humor was just stupid  br    br   seriously     minutes in i gave up and turned it off  the slurs  racism and little kids throwing bricks at each other got to me  also there was no plot that i could see  the only thing worth seeing in this film was william haines who was a top leading man in the silent era  br    br   just painful  avoid             thank god this wasn  t based on a true story  because what a story it is  populated by despicable characters whose depravity knows no bounds  before the devil is a mesmerizing  jaw dropping excursion into perversion which would be laughable  and sometimes is  even with   or perhaps because of   the sickeningly tragic undercurrent of human dysfunction throughout  if it weren  t carried out with such magnificent  overwhelming conviction by its stars  the excellent script by kelly masterson and superb direction by none other than sidney lumet doesn  t hurt either  br    br   the main dysfunction here is of a family nature  with the two majorly screwed up brothers  brilliant portrayals from philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke  deciding to rob their own parents   jewelry store  an attempt that goes pathetically awry  br    br   the story is told with time shifts  which are noted on screen  such as    charlie  two days before the robbery    so no one should be confused   some people have said they didn  t like this device but i thought it worked perfectly  adding to the skeweredness of the whole affair  considering that the two brothers in question are hardly playing with full decks   between them you couldn  t make a decent poker hand to save your life  throw in these cheesy extra tidbits  one of the brothers is a drug addict  married to gina  marisa tomei  also excellent   who is having an affair with the other brother  toss in some monumental sibling rivalry  along with the fact that said drug addict brother hates his father  a wrenching performance from albert finney   who has apparently caused him serious past pain  and you  ve got a shakespearean greek tragedy on your hands  proceed with caution             if you want just about everything you want to know about wwii from multiple perspectives  this dvd delivers  you will learn new things guaranteed  so much so that you won  t need any other documentary  s on the subject  get this  watch it  learn from it  good for school use as well  as a bonus  watch this with tora tora tora  saving private ryan  patton  band of brothers  a bridge too far  the longest day and other wwii epics along with this to make your knowledge of wwii even more complete  sir laurence oliver  s voice adds to the overall atmosphere of each episode in this    part series  seriously you won  t find a better wwii documentary set on the subject  perfect                  the movie was gripping from start to finish and its b w photography of the american heartland is stunning  we feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into mexico and back to america again  near the end of the movie  the reflection of the rain on robert blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face  in the end  we follow them up the stairway to their final moment   br    br   the two criminals  performed by robert blake and scott wilson  as perry smith and dick hickock could be seen on any street in any town  hickock is a smiling boy next door and smith  the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town  this point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else  evil  even the most vile  is part of the human condition  these two delusional men kill an entire family  looking for a safe that isn  t there  once on the run  they start writing bad cheques  carving out a trail for the authorities  br    br   there are many fine supporting actors  i like john forsyth as the detective on the case  alvin dewey  also  will geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney  br    br   i have often wanted to see this movie all the way through  having only caught it in short snatches  i did finally get to it after buying the dvd  the result is the finest classic crime movie i have ever seen  br    br   don  t miss this brilliant movie  to me  this is what great film making is all about             this is a great show with total freshness and innovation  that usual chair  couch for a woman  host  that mandatory band playing monotonous tunes  the same old jokes  the same pattern copied from the days of nebuchadnezzer     probably the pattern of johnny carson  copied by one and all  latterman  leno  conan    daly  this show does not seem to have any of these  br    br   i fell in love with this show within the first    minutes and i am going to stick to it  though it  s too early to say that  this show seems to be devoid of any intellectual pretension most talk shows try so hard to project  and i hope that that is what would make this show different from all the rest  i hope that this show will last long  br    br   returning back after months  i still love this show  and i love his self deprecating humor  for example  his affirmation that only pothead loners would be home to watch his show at saturday midnight and thus  the jokes are funny only to the stoned guys  which  however  does not involve the usual monkeying of conan o  brien  for example  i know it  s a cardinal sin to be repelled by o  brien  s antics  but i do really dislike his style and repetitiveness    br    br   i again watched it the other night with tom arnold in it  ferensen  s spoof of trading spouses  and nanny     in an earlier episode  are hilarious  idiot paparazzi are fun  especially when a security guard cautions them against taking people  s pictures  and  if i am not mistaken  they start taking his pictures shouting   gary coleman    br    br   added on   th april        coming back once again  i am left confused by the neighbor and her dog  i cannot decide if it is a joke or a real thing  either way  it was funny as hell  br    br   i do not expect spike feresten to read these pages  but maybe he does  he is crazier than a bunch of monkeys and so  i would better write down my suggestion here for him  i would like him to do a full    minute show with crazy gideon  the star of late night tv commercial  i would like crazy gideon to have an interview in spike  s talk show  sing a song  and play guitar   do a skit in the line of snl  and also to answer questions from the audience regarding his potential mayorship of los angeles  i know  crazy gideon may not be aware of this  but there are websites detailing why he would be the perfect candidate for the post of the mayor of la   br    br   god willing  br    br   returning back on   th july        someone wrote here that the people who praised spike  s talkshow must be bribed by spike  i confess that spike really bribed me  but i must also confess that rockefeller named me in his will and last night i had sex with cindy crowford             it  s all about getting what you want when you want it  and the message of bluebeard  s eighth wife is to be careful what you wish for  until what you wish for wishes for you  br    br   most men have heard the stories about what happens when your sexual frustration isn  t relieved and a certain part of your anatomy turning blue  misogynistic pirates aside  cooper plays a very wealthy man who is very accustomed to getting what he wants whenever he wants it  learning only too late that it wasn  t what he expected and never learning his lesson until he runs into the feisty claudette colbert  through a twisted  in soul and in practice  business deal  he ends up marring buying her with the intent of bedding her  but she will have none of it  literally  and frustrates him at every turn  and corner  and room  and tourist attraction  br    br   the film has definite french sensibilities which means it has strong double entendres and boudoir humor for the day and a sharp edge you  re not accustomed to  and may not enjoy seeing  in either cooper or colbert  the whole reason i watched the film was because they are   likable   actors  and the whole point of this movie is that they  re unlikable people  or at least likable people who have developed unlikable traits to protect themselves  they think  from the world   br    br   if you can accept it on its own terms you  ll find satisfaction in this witty and sophisticated film   and satisfaction  as we said  is what it  s all about  such a movie with such a cast only comes around  after all  once in a   ummm   blue moon             now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly i  m appalled  for anyone to even think that the sopranos is not television then i  m afraid i don  t know what the world has come to  let me tell u something  i started watching many t v shows like lost  prison break  dexter  deadwood and even invasion  but all of those shows lost their touch after the first season  especially lost and prison break which i refuse to watch because the companies took   genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season  then we have the sopranos  i can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season  and more importantly all of its episodes  there is no department that this show doesn  t excel in  acting  nothing short of superb  james gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode  after i heard that hbo wanted ray liotta to play tony i felt that it would  ve been the better choice  however after watching the first few episodes  i knew that hbo had done a great job in casting james as tony  the raw emotion he displays is superb  then we have everyone else  edie falco  michael imperioli  lorraine bracco  dominic chianese  whom i remembered as johnny ola in the godfather part    and my personal two favourite characters tony sirico and steve van zandt paulie   walnuts   gualtieri and silvio dante  all of these actors perform to the best quality  and all giving an excellent performance in each episode  then we have the story  never have i been so sucked into a t v show before  the story is nothing short of excellent  each episode is directed superbly and the score of this show is just fantastic  i feel that the sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of  its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence  but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the television  and i challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show  not just say its too violent  or they feel that the character of tony is immoral  i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day  i don  t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to god  i implore everyone to watch this show because believe me  you  ll be hooked from the very first episode  i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show  hooked on it  trust me when i say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on t v  after you  ve watched the first season  you  ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates television  and no t v show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is the sopranos             i  d give this a negative rating if i could  i went into this movie not expecting much  but i had an open mind  the whole thing is stupid  the snakes are obviously fake and the first two things they bite are a boob and a guys johnson  oh how original  if i were a    year old boy i might laugh at that  i have no idea how this movie became so popular  seriously the worst thing i  ve ever seen  i wasn  t entertained  it wasn  t funny i wasn  t even bored  i wasn  t anything  it wasn  t even so bad it was good  it  s just bad  ridiculous actually  please do not waste your money on this movie  don  t even rent this movie  no clue how it  s getting such a high rating             most people are totally unaware that this movie exists  fox  which paid judge to make it  has kept it in the can for quite awhile and then spent nothing to promote it  i guess that made many people think it was one of the garbage movies being flushed in late summer  well  i am here to tell you that this is a funny and rather frightening look at a future that is not that hard to believe  basically  judge puts forward the notion that the stupid are outbreeding the smart by a wide margin  then these stupid are getting more stupid  by basically spending all of their time watching tv and having sex  which produces more stupid people  by       a person of average intelligence today  will appear to be a genius  that talks   all faggy    seriously  is this really that hard to believe  oh sure  this future is painfully funny and ridiculously stupid  but still plausible  luke wilson is great as the time traveling army guy  hopelessly trying to get back to a more comfortable time  where this story will gain its cult status is with the numerous funny one liners  like   can we family style her   and   hey man  i  m   bating here    this is a funny movie and a rather sharp social commentary on an american society that seems to be fatuated with self pleasure  comfort and stupidity  and i guarantee you that i will be buying this on dvd the first day it comes out and watching it over and over             this is a great  ridiculous horror movie that captures the essence of the mid to late   s   obsession with how evil metal music supposedly was  i can remember being freaked out by metal teens when i was a kid  it doesn  t help that i found a desecrated grave in my hometown  s graveyard when i was ten  turns out this weird metal kid had dug up some old bodies and used their bones in some weird sacrifice to satan  so maybe stuff like deterred me from metal for awhile  but i love it now  as a    year old  br    br   i bought this dvd used for   bucks and i expected it to suck due to the lame cover  but to my surprise  it ruled  it is all about the extreme demonic power of metal  and you gotta love a scene where a guitar shoots lazers and vaporizes headbangers in the crowd  this movie is awesome  if you love   s metal and bad movies  this one  s for you                   while not quite as good as a murder is announced  which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book  this is an excellent adaptation  and you know what  it is a huge improvement on the geraldine mcewan version  now i don  t take pride in bad mouthing the geraldine mcewan adaptations  two or three of them were surprisingly good  but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script  a confusing final solution or both  the geraldine mcewan version suffered from a plodding pace  and both of the above problems  and i would consider second worst of the itv adaptations  worst being sittaford mystery  which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing  this adaptation of the book nemesis is a huge improvement  it not only respects the book  despite a few liberties  but it pretty much rectifies the problems the itv version had  despite the added character of lionel coming across as rather irritating  more to do with how he was written than how he was acted  and one or two moments of sluggish pacing  this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book  it is beautifully filmed  with nice photography and period detail  and the music as always is excellent  the performances are wonderful this time around  and make the most of an in general well done script  with joan hickson brilliant as always as miss marple  and solid turns from liz fraser  helen cherry  joanna hole and anna cropper  margaret tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as clothilde  overall  well worth watching  better than the recent version in pretty much all departments       bethany cox            good lord  what were they thinking         here is your spoiler warning  even though i don  t think it  ll really matter  you won  t be seeing this piece of trash anyway  br    br   a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people  who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them  and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies  in other words  the whole thing is really stupid  br    br   you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can  t save something   and they didn  t  i know  some of their lines were funny  like what to add to the sign   hit   and the hand comments  but  geez  this was pretty dang sad  br    br   all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud  it is not worth your eyes             i had heard  and read  so many good things about weeds that i was looking forward to getting hooked on another great cable series  like entourage  sopranos or mad men  but that slowly eroded away with each episode i watched from season one   didn  t make it past the first six episodes   br    br   the writing was unoriginal  contrived and the portrayal of blacks embarrassing  the dialog felt forced  like the writers are trying way too hard to be clever and hip   it was a rare moment when i actually emitted an audible laugh  br    br   the characters never developed enough for me to care about them  they were selfish and unappealing  i absolutely hated the addition of the brother in law  who should have been hauled away on to catch a predator  and the removal of the hodes   daughter quinn from the cast by sending her to boarding school in mexico was so unoriginal and clich    i had to conclude the writers were testing the viewer  s loyalty  br    br   episode after episode i liked the characters less and couldn  t get past many of the technical flaws in the story line  br    br   add to that i heard that season two wasn  t as good  so i lost all motivation to continue to watch this play out  br    br   if you  re a fan of good casting and writing  i suspect this show will be a challenge for you to like  unless of course you  re stoned and then all bets are off             this movie is among my favorite foreign films  some of the others are amilee and my life as a dog  the similarities with those movies as with so many great foreign films  is that it takes a mundane slice of life and transforms it into a profound heartfelt lesson   br    br   in japan  a man who is bored with his mundane life and the rut of his married life  sees a beautiful japanese woman staring out the window of a dance studio  in the instant that it takes his train to pass  he is enthralled by her  but is it only by her beauty  by her faraway glance  or a connection that they will both discover that they share   br    br   shall we dance has memorable wonderful characters who have to deal with painful realities by transcending them through the world of dance  breaking traditional moulds and stereo types of japanese society  they risk all for happiness and find that joy is not too far away  it is one of those movies that is so magical and meaningful and  in itself  transcends the mundane by showing the true magic and miracle that life can be             as if the film were not of value in itself  this is an excellent way to get an overview of the novel as a preface to reading it  in the summer of      i saw the film in nyc  that fall in graduate school  i read the book for the first time  some of the pleasure in reading the novel was my memory of the scrupulously detailed film  and for better or worse  and i  ve now read and taught the novel for over three decades  milo o  shea is still leopold bloom             this film is a lyrical and romantic memoir told through the eyes an eleven year old boy living in a rural cuban town the year of the castro revolution  it is an obviously genuine worthy labor of love   br    br   the names cuba libre and cuban blood are merely attempts to wrongly market this as an action film  dreaming of julia makes much more sense  it has more in common with european cinema than with rambo and the revolution is merely an inconvenience to people  s daily lives and pursuits  that fact alone makes the film more honest than most works dealing with this time period in cuban history  br    br   the excessive use of the voice over narrator does undermine the story but the film makes up for it with unqualified clips from hollywood films that say so much more visually than the narrator could  br    br   the comparisons to cinema paradiso and are fair game as the film does wax melancholy about movies  but there is an underlying pain at the loss of a lifestyle that surpasses lost love   br    br   the revolution  like the film julie  never seems to have an ending             i saw zp when it was first released and found it a major disappointment  its script seemed forced and arch and too fakey     s  it  s politics too upfront and ridiculous  and let  s face it  i was still under a love spell known as blowup   and i still haven  t completely shaken it  now the   love   is twisted up with all sorts of nostalgia it evokes and  oh well       good luck to me  br    br   but time marches on and time has been kind to zp and time has been a teacher to me  i revisit this film about every ten years and it just gets better and better with age  and zp is it  s own   experience  and is only really linked to blowup through its creator  the late great mr  antonioni  br    br   twelve years ago  i had the great good fortune to see an absolutely pristine print  projected at its correct size  immense   restored by an italian government cultural agency who knows a good work of art when they see it and knows the importance of keeping such a thing of beauty in good shape  to this day i remember the gasp from the audience when the first shot of death valley appeared  it was like a thousand volt visual shock antonioni had intentionally delivered to wake us up to a new level of awareness  and indeed what follows from that point is an entirely different sort of   place    br    br   what is astonishing to me is how this film is coming into its own  br    br   i remember the second time around seeing it     the early   s     i had begun to feel affection towards the film as a whole and towards daria and mark in particular  whereas  before these two seemed like a smart alecky shadow version of zefferelli  s olivia and leonard  read  romeo and juliet they now were engaging me     particularly the girl in her insistent slo motion ality  she took her time       to live  everything  everything dies around her  br    br   upon exciting the theater the daylight of reality quickly began to erase my new found   enjoyment    the encroaching shoulder padded  big haired   s whispered   but that  s a hippie fantasy     let it go   br    br   the force of antonioni  s vision had  i had realised  already worked itself inside of me the first time around so i answered     s   with an   uh huh   and guarded my   love   secretly  possessively and jealously  br    br   but  this  then is what good art does it lives inside of you  and  if you wish it has its way and   loves   you back  secretly  jealously  and possessively  and you get   changed    br    br   was thrilled to see that turner classic movies had decided to show zp in its march lineup  undoubtedly  zp must be seen on a gigantic screen so that it can truly take you into its constructed environment  but  hey  sometimes even a glimpse of the beloved in a newspaper photo is no better than no glimpse at all  br    br   today reality hit  zp has been withdrawn mysteriously and replaced with the whiney antics of alice  s restaurant  br    br   so  it is still too   difficult    too   disturbing    too   what    br    br   maybe it  s that  as with all good art  it lives while everything dies around it   br    br   peace             very strange but occasionally elegant exploitation movie with no real story  but benefiting from its stunningly ravishing lead actress and a handful of nice  gruesome make up effects  daniella is a beautiful twenty something girl  carrying with her the trauma of being raped at the age of     nightmares and hallucinations lead her further into believing she  s the reincarnation of a female ancestor who was said to be a werewolf  she kills her brother in law during a nightly encounter and gets submitted in a hospital  she escapes again  however  and randomly devours more men whilst on the run for police detectives  doctors and relatives  it  s all pretty to look at and listen too  really great soundtrack   but the absence of plot and continuity become irritating quite fast  luckily enough  leading lady annik borel rarely ever wears clothes and she fills up the boring moments by dancing naked around a fire  the film is too long  too weird and too forgettable  the biggest surprise comes at the end  when suddenly and out of the blue  director rino di silvestro tries to make us believe that his movie was based on true facts  yeah  right               this is an interesting  hard to find movie from the early     s starring jan michael vincent as a young man who doesn  t make the cut as a marine  dressed in   baby blue   outfits to humiliate them as they are sent home  the failed recruits are sent packing  vincent stops at a bar and runs into a very young richard gere who has just returned from a tour in the pacific as a hard core marine   raider    gere  s character is already jaded and contemplating desertion  and he takes advantage of vincent  s innocence  stealing his   baby blue   uniform after getting him drunk and beating him in an alleyway  vincent  s character  whose name is marion  takes gere  s outfit and is suddenly transformed into a marine   raider    marion hitch hikes his way into wyoming and stops at a little norman rockwell like little town  in the local caf   he meets rose hudkins  who immediately catches his eye  staying with hudkins parents  marion attracts all sorts of attention from the towns folks  mr hudkins suspects marion and wonders how a marine   raider   could still be so innocent  the story also brings up the japanese internment camps  as the towns folks go   hunting     escapees  marion is shot accidentally during this hunt  but there  s still a happy ending  which befuddled me a bit  i would have preferred a little more drama  anyway  this captures jmv at the peak of his     s performances  buster and billie  baby blue marine and white line fever in the mid     s were amazingly good jmv performances  he was both an action star and a heart throb all at the same time    he made a lot of quality movies during his career  and continued to do so up into the mid     s with the great tv show airwolf  he does a very good job in this as   hedge    quietly observing the way people treat him  in his uniform  as he travels across the country  he must have performed some of the stunt work as well  there is a harrowing river scene at the end of the movie and it looks like he  s the guy getting tossed down the river to me  but really  at the height of his popularity  this movie could have done so much more with jmv  s talent and his looks  innocence can only be so interesting  evil  as explored in   buster and billie    is much more dramatic  anyway  glynnis o  connor is delightful as rose  the whole look of the movie is like a norman rockwell painting  the outdoor scenes are gorgeous   must have been filmed in canada             johnny and june carter cash financed this film which is a traditional rendering of the gospel stories  the music is great  you get a real feel of what the world of jesus looked like  i  ve been there too   and june gets into the part of mary magdalene with a passion  cash  s narration is good too  br    br   but     br    br      the actor who played jesus was miscast     there is no edge to the story like cash puts in some of his faith based music     because it is uncompelling  i doubt we  ll see this ever widely distributed again  br    br   i  d love to buy the cd  br    br   tom paine texas  usa            j  niksen vuosi is one of jarva  s most political movies  it takes stance strongly against modern day society  s authority status in the life of the common man  and how it has estranged men from the nature completely  it challenges the whole concept of freedom and wealth in our welfare society  br    br   vatanen  antti litja    smothered buy the concrete jungle with all its rules and regulations   tries to rattle the chains of the society by escaping it all in to the wilderness of northern finland   only to realize that the concept of a   free country   isn  t all that unambiguous  in other words  the society has the common man by the balls  br    br   still the thing that makes j  niksen vuosi so exceptional   besides the visual and humouristic brilliance   is how it seems to illustrate the whole political atmosphere in finland in the     s  as well as the whole identity of finland as a nation  vatanen is like an archetype of a classical finn in his solitudeness and social distantness  since nature has always played such an important role in the national identity of us finns  the whole idea of that being slowly taken away by the modern society makes j  niksen vuosi emotionally exceptionally moving             i love jamie foxx  br    br   and i enjoy     of all movies i see  br    br   and i walked out of this one  br    br   now  i admit  it may have had something to do with the two middle aged white women in the back of theatre who laughed at every little thing    oh no  jamie  s knocking on a door  hee hee hee      but    this was just so incredibly annoying  there could be no sustained camera shot  and no camera shot from a conventional angle    everything had to be in your face  loud  and annoying  br    br   the bad guy tried to be smooth and malkovich like  but at this point  it  s just old and tired  he brought nothing new or interesting  from all the characters  too many lines you saw coming  too many you  ve heard before  and too many   tough guy   lines    and i don  t mind that sort of thing  really  as long as there  s a bit of originality to it  in fact  pretty much the entire supporting cast just sucked  br    br   i love jamie foxx  and i think he  s really funny  and i thought he was funny in this movie    but not nearly funny enough for me to endure everything else   br    br   this movie needed less shoot em up  less annoying camera shots  more emotion  more feeling  and more jamie foxx  i gave it a               after seeing dick tracy in the       bin at future shop i decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of mafia and crime movies  i was very surprised to see a very fun  smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout  the movie moves along well  it has of course another solid performance from warren beatty  but the real standouts of the film are al pacino and madonna  i was happy to find out that pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city  madonna was great as the damsel in distress  she really impressed me and added depth to her performance  if you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun  smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give dick tracy a try  i don  t think you will be disappointed  and watch for the cameos from paul sorvino  james caan  kathy bates and dustin hoffman among others            send them to the freezer  this is the solution two butchers find after they discover the popularity of selling human flesh  an incredible story with humor and possible allegories that make it much more than a horror film  the complex characters defy superficial classification and make the story intriguing and worthwhile   if you can stand it  definitely a dark film but also a bit redemptive            wow  i picked this off the rental shelf because i loved robert carlyle and jonny lee miller in   trainspotting    this is a phenomenal movie  it has action  romance  suspense  intrigue and wit  when i wasn  t laughing  i was at the edge of my seat  this is definitely a film i would recommend to people with an appreciation for intelligent dialogue and a fresh perspective of the   th century  this film has everything to keep me happy             i don  t know why some people criticise that show so much  br    br   it is a great  funny show   probably not the right material for mainstream prime time  but still    br    br   the family dynamics are funny  and all in all the same you see in most comedy shows  the supporting characters are absolutely hilarious  the plots of the individual episodes and the frequent siegfried   roy jibes are only just above average  but ever so often you have sub plots or one liners that make you roll on the floor laughing  br    br   this show was well worth the   pounds i paid for it  br    br   rating                  mexican werewolf in texas is set in the small border town of furlough where anna  erika fay  lives  her best friend is rosie  martine hughes    she has a mexican boyfriend named miguel  gabriel gutierrez  who are determined to track a beast down that has been terrorising the town  killing livestock   several residents including some of their friends  local mexican legends speak of the chupacabra  an evil creature from myth   legend  erm  i  m struggling now because not that much else actually happens    br    br   written   directed by scott maginnis i won  t beat about the bush here   simply say that mexican werewolf in texas is awful  period  the script only ever mentions the word werewolf once   the rest of the time it  s referred to a chupacabra  in fact i suspect this wasn  t really conceived as a werewolf flick at all  the   werewolf   creature looks mostly hairless   more like some vicious dog  there is no reference to anybody changing during the full moon   it actually attacks during the day on a couple of occasions  there is no transformation scene   at the end when it is killed it doesn  t change back into anyone either  to be honest apart from the title there  s nothing here to indicate a werewolf film at all   even then the title is just a rip off of the highly popular an american werewolf in london         this is the type of home made crap that i personally think is killing the horror genre  how long has it been since there was a true low budget horror classic like dawn of the dead         the evil dead         halloween        or friday the   th        which were all made on shoe string budgets  maybe the blair witch project        but that  s it in recent years   crap like mexican werewolf in texas has absolutely no chance of ever being considered a classic  the character  s are awful   things just happen around them  the dialogue is rubbish  the pacing is terrible  the story sucks   virtually sent me to sleep   as a whole this film is just crap  i  m sorry but i don  t know how else to describe it  br    br   director maginnis does nothing to make this watchable  there  s the annoying hand held camera type cinematography which could easily give someone a headache   quick   blink   you  ll miss something   editing which just annoys   irritates in equal measure  it  s not scary  there  s no nudity  there  s no tension or atmosphere   the special effects are awful  the monster really does look poor   it  s no wonder maginnis keeps it in the shadows or cuts his scenes so quickly you never get a good look at it  there  s virtually no colour to the picture either  it  s either almost pitch black or over saturated desert sand oranges which makes the thing an eye sore as well  the gore consists of some fake guts  blink   you  ll miss them    a few bloody wounds   a severed arm  big deal  br    br   with a supposed budget of about          i admit the budget was low but i simply refuse to accept that for making such a rubbish film  there are plenty of low budget horror flicks that make their meagre budgets go far  the whole thing has the look of a home movie  it has no style   is throughly bland   dull to look at  the acting sucks too although you probably already knew that  br    br   mexican werewolf in texas will probably con a few people into renting buying watching it because they might mistakenly think it  s a sequel to john landis   classic which it most certainly isn  t   it isn  t even a proper werewolf flick either  don  t be fooled this is awful   i  m fed up of having to waste time money on home made amateur crap like this             i found this to be a surprisingly light handed touch at a       s culture clash movie  john wayne would hardly be one  s first choice as a cultural attache  being about as diplomatic with his good intentions as a bull run in harrods  but this time he was left to play a part that was far more passive than his usual bluff persona  and he accomplished his task with style  the duke was a guy who really could act well  his facial expressions and body language could be extremely subtle  br    br   despite his considerable presence both as an actor and in terms of screen time  he failed to dominate this movie  many of his good intentions came a cropper  he had authority over nobody  and the intermittent narrative was provided by the titular geisha to whom he was the barbarian  br    br   the story of american attempts to curry favour with an isolationist japan was one of political intrigue rather than swashbuckling or hell for leather battles  i cannot comment on the accuracy of its research but the strangeness of the oriental culture to western sensibilities was demonstrated well  there was a great deal of minutely choreographed ceremony entailing what looked to this observer like authentic costume and props  the set pieces were complex and detailed  a lot of money and thought had been applied to it  br    br   the fractured romance between wayne and his geisha added a little extra element  and stopped the movie becoming just a political or flag waving effort  script was good without being too wordy  there was a great deal of japanese dialogue  but the lengthy periods of translation didn  t interfere with the narrative  it was nice to see plenty of genuine orientals on the set  whether or not they were japanese  i couldn  t say  but anyway they looked the part  at least the leads were not played by cross dressing caucasians  unlike other efforts such as   blood alley    yes  i know they were chinese    the inn of the sixth happiness   or even   the king and i    br    br   frankly  i enjoyed this more than any of those other movies  the script was better for a start  i never liked the songs in   the king and i    and wasn  t impressed by the heavy laden anti communist subtext of   blood alley    i confess to never having seen this work before and found it compared very favourably to many of the duke  s more popular outings  br    br   recommended             i was so glad i came across this short film  i  m always so disappointed that short films are hard to come across  so when i saw this and saw that it was nominated for the live action short film at the academy awards  i was so pleased that i actually had a film that i was rooting for  br    br   the plot is pretty simple  the director  writer  and star nacho vigalondo tried coming up with a reason people would suddenly break out into a song and dance number like they do in movie musicals  the result is extremely entertaining and the song is actually really catchy  br    br   it  s a well made short film  well edited and the actors all do a great job  and the last shot of the film is perfect  br    br   i highly recommend this film             i thought before starting with these movie that it might be a good one  but when i started with it i found it really awful  they said movie is being made in afghanistan but i think     of the movie is shot in india  you can see indian made cars  you can see lars drinking bisleri an indian water brand   hindi written on the road  you can also see temples in afghanistan  hahah  its really funny and many more stuff which proves its not shot in afghanistan  i think one should not waste his her time watching this movie   pure time waste   i would recommend to do something else instead of watching this movie or may be might heart is better idea but don  t watch this waste of time            truly appalling waste of space  me and my friend tried to watch this film to its conclusion but had to switch it off about    minutes from the end  and i can count the films i have switched off before the end on one hand  br    br   the script and direction are leaden and deeply uninspiring  i wouldn  t be surprised if they found the script in a pile of cast off scripts from       for example the irritating scroat threatening the real estate guy from his house phone  i mean seriously  the police would be beating his door down in minutes  the scenes and events just wash by you like turds in a river  it is difficult to understand the actual thrust of the film  the narrative flicks between characters in a seemingly random manner breaking up the pathetic attempts at building the characters  oh and what   characters   they are  the protagonist played by rourke is dreadful  he could have just sent a cardboard cut out of himself and stayed in bed  after    or so minutes of the film i had built absolutely zero attachment to this character  he is neither sympathetic nor hateful  just a disfigured dummy from a shop window blundering through every single scene  his motivation is impossible to discern from his generally mumbled and emotionless delivery  is he happy  is he sad  angry  no idea  just those same dead eyes staring out at you from a disfigured chunk of flesh  and the native american theme is just awful and pointless  br    br   the good guys are at best unlikeable  a dull white collar stereotype and a simpering neurotic ex wife stereotype  cue archetypal wife with shotgun face off with bad guy    you aren  t going to shoot me   that is both tiresomely unoriginal and annoying  br    br   the richie nix character seems interesting at first but soon descends into an irritating one sided psycho character  which seems at odds with the seeming intention of making the bad guys in some way sympathetic or at least realistically motivated  br    br   roasario dawsons character starts with some promise but soon descends into a sickening and childlike parody of the gangsters chick scenes from jackie brown  you really want me to believe her character was so attracted to rourke  s  or worse she is just a floozy who sleeps with anything that moves  realistic female characters ftw   br    br   in summary a complete mess of a film  hopeless characterisations and performances  a leaden and hackneyed script along with uninspired direction  and ultimately extremely dull  its not even comedy bad either  laughing at rourkes haggard face gets pretty old after sitting through the first    turgid minutes of the film             in this movie  ch  vez supporters  either venezuelan and not venezuelan  just lie about a dramatic situation in our country   br    br   they did not say that the conflict started because of ch  vez announcement firing a lot of pdvsa best workers just for political issues  br    br   they did not say anything about more than    tv interruptions transmitted by ch  vez during only   days in   cadena nacional    a kind of confiscation o private tv signals   each one with about    minutes of duration  br    br   they did not tell us anything about the quiting announcement made by general en jefe lucas rincon romero  inspector general of the army forces  who is a traditional supporter of ch  vez  even now  in despite of his announcement  he is the ministro de interior y justicia  after ch  vez return he occuped the charge of ministro del defensa  equals to defense secretary in us   br    br   they did not say anything about ch  vez orders about shooting against a pacifical people concentration who was claiming for elections  br    br   they did not say anything about the people in this concentration that were killed by ch  vez supporters  either civilians and military official forces   br    br   they present some facts in a wrong order  in order to lie  br    br   they did not say anything about venezuelan civilian society thats are even now claiming for an elections in order to solve the crisis and ch  vez actions in order to avoid the elections  br    br   that  s why i tell you     this movie is just a lot of lies or a big lie             one could wish that an idea as good as the   invisible man   would work better and be more carefully handled in the age of fantastic special effects  but this is not the case  the story  the characters and  finally the entire last    minutes of the film are about as fresh as a mad scientist flick from the early     s  there are some great moments  mostly due to the amazing special effects and to the very idea of an invisible man stalking the streets  but alas  soon we  re back in the cramped confinement of the underground lab  which means that the rest of the film is not only predictable  but schematic  br    br   there has been a great many remakes of old films or tv shows over the past    years  and some of them have their charms  but it  s becoming clearer and clearer for each film that the idea of putting ol   classics under the noses of eager madmen like verhoeven  who does have his moments  is a very bad one  it is obvious that the money is the key issue here  the time and energy put into the script is nowhere near enough  and as a result    hollow man   is seriously undermined with clich  s  sappy characters  predictability and lack of any depth whatsoever  br    br   however  the one thing that actually impressed me  beside the special effects  was the swearing  when making this kind of film  modern producers are very keen on allowing kids to see them  therefore  the language  and  sometimes  the violence and sex  is very toned down  when the whole world blows up  the good guys go   oh darn    and   oh my god      hollow man   gratefully discards that kind of hypocrisy and the characters are at liberty to say what comes most natural to them  i  m not saying that the most natural response to something gone wrong is to swear   but it makes it more believable if someone actually swears  i think we can thank verhoeven for that             ok  so it owes pulp fiction  but in my opinion has it  s own voice and identity mainly because of the music video direction style  sketch like narrative and great performances  thomas jane delivers great  the drug dealer show down is extraordinary   aaron eckhart likewise  james legros has a short and effervescent appearance great humor   they got the wong house    the porzikova interrogation and rape scene is memorable  as is mickey rourke  s cameo appearance   take a peak    br    br   great hollywood popcorn b production with strong performances of a level aspirants and renegades rourke   br    br   well  take a peak  it  s worth             as far as i know the real guy that the main actor is playing saw his performance and said it was an outstanding portrayal  i  d agree with him  this is a fantastic film about a quite gifted boy man with a special body part helping him  oscar and bafta winning  and golden globe nominated daniel day lewis plays christy browna crippled man with cerebral palsy who spends most of his life on the floor  in a wheelchair and carried by his family  he has a special left foot though  he can write with it  paint with it and hold things with it  he learns to speak later in the film  it is very good for a guy like him  also starring home alone    s oscar winning  and golden globe nominated brenda fricker as mrs  brown and bafta winning ray mcanally as mr  brown  it was nominated the oscars for best director for jim sheridan  best writing  screenplay based on material from another medium and best picture  it was nominated the baftas for best film  best make up artist and best adapted screenplay  daniel day lewis was number    on the     greatest movie stars  he was number    on the    greatest british actors  he was number   on britain  s finest actors  and he was number    on the world  s greatest actor  and the film was number    on the    greatest british films  outstanding             all i ever heard while being raised was equality of the sexes  and here we have a film that not only exemplifies imbalance  but continues through with a whole concept that one sex is better  all the while watching i was hoping for that redeeming quality to make the viewer feel as though there is hope for the future  and there wasn  t  i  ll admit to not finishing the film  i had to turn it off at the part where the old man whore told the genetic man adam that it was ok to be a whore and get  and i quote    more tail than any man in the past time    i know not finishing it is a bad review on myself  but it is the responsibility of the writer and crew to develope a story that will keep a viewer interested  and they failed  this film betrays all true female nature qualities of the mother figure and the need for balance  instead it exemplifies what america ran by lesbian natzis would be like and i  m not against lesbians  thank you mr  director  someone please give me a redeeming quality    wait i have it  there  s no sequel             i do regret that i have bought this series  i expected more action  more objective picture and more consistency  this is just a pure propaganda series  very dark  without any charm  or romanticism  it is just boredom itself  i find the actors work quite weak as well  o  donnell might seem charming as robin  with batman   but in this picture he lacks any charm  probably while he becomes older  he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up  it comes as no surprise  that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the uk for     of the recommended price and was not even released in the netherlands             the story has been told before  a deadly disease is spreading around    but the extra in this film is peter weller  his interpretation of muller on the run is real  he is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child  this person could be working next to you             this film was very well advertised  i am an avid movie goer and have seen previews for this movie for months  while i was somewhat skeptical of how funny this movie would actually be  my friends thought it was going to be great and hyped me up about it  then i went and saw it  i was sunk down in my seat almost asleep until i remembered that i had paid for this movie  i made myself laugh at most of the stuff in the movie just so i wouldnt feel bad and destroy the good mood i was in  plus i wanted to get my monies worth out of the movie  i always go into a movie with an open mind  not trying to go into them with too many expectations  but this movie was not that funny  now it wasnt the worst movie i  ve ever seen  but it is definitely worth waiting for hbo  if you havent seen many previews for the movie or you like very slow and corny comedies you may enjoy it  but for true comedy fans id say pass  maybe even check out the kings of comedy again  something told me to go see meet the parents instead               as far as i know this was my first experience with icelandic movies  it  s such a relief to see something else than your regular hollywood motion picture  too bad that movies like this one have a small chance of succeeding in the big world  i can only hope that people watch this by accident  by recommendation or other    br    br   because it  s really worth while  i left the cinema feeling really sad  i couldn  t get the tragic destiny  s of the characters out of my head  and it impressed me even more when i thought of the complexity of the film  not only was it a tragic story  it had excellent comic reliefs and a very good soundtrack  br    br   if you have the opportunity  watch it  it  s really thought provoking and made me ponder a lot  br    br               very typical almod  var of the time and  in its own way  no less funny than many of his later works  and why is that  there is nothing to be provoked or shocked about  and i guess any such effect is more coincidental than intentional  no  the great humor stems from an underlying  almost surreal  absurdity that is woven into the scenery  the characters   nearly complete lack of taboo  it  s the same kind of   comic suspense   you find in his later works  though you  ll find it in a more rough version here  he  s building up for masterpieces to come  but is not yet there  br    br   the sole reviewer who commented on this movie before i did  claimed that it had to be a   very select   group of people who  d find this movie hilarious  i do             once again  doctor who delivers the goods by the bucket load  it has humour    you  re just making it up as you go along      yup  but i do it brilliantly     action  monsters  in this case still more kick ass cybermen   tragedy and scare tactics  in short  just what the doctor ordered  pun intended   the way that the emotions move from one to the other is done so well that there is no feeling of   get on with it    so  chalk up   out of the last   episodes that have made you laugh  then made you cry  and made you go   eek    br    br   in terms of character development  this is clearly the clincher for noel clarke  s mickey  and ricky   being one of the doctor  s companions  you know that he will do the right thing  and may even suspect the manner that he does it  however  it is still an emotional wrench when he confirms his future path  br    br   while   the rise of the cybermen   had more of the sinister build up to terror    the age of steel   is an all out blast  like   alien   compared to   aliens     both true classics  but in different ways  can the series keep it up at this level  let  s hope so             a brother  s promise is a wonderful family film  this is a biography of dan jansen  a champion olympic speed skater  the movie depicts this athlete  s life from a young age through full adulthood  the love and support of the family members is evident throughout  how dan and the rest of his family handle winning and losing races is a life lesson for all of us  the commitment and determination of dan  s coach and his teammates  shows what it takes to make a real team  how dan and his family deal with a devastating illness of a loved one is depicted without undo sentiment or sugarcoating  the faith of the family is shown in basic terms and is obviously a major part of their lives  this is a powerful family film which can be meaningful for a person of any age             well   now that i know where rob zombie stole the title for his   house of       corpses   crapfest  i can now rest in peace  nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in   the house of seven corpses    but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot  ha   anyway  to kill the bloody amateurs making a low rent horror flick in his former abode  in hell house  sorry  i don  t remember the actual name of the residence   a bunch of mysterious  unexplained deaths took place long ago  some  like arthritic lurch stand in john carradine  whose small role provides the film  s only worthwhile moments   attribute it to the supernatural  bellowing film director john ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum  the result comes across like   satan  s school for girls    catchy title  made for tv production values  intriguing plot  crossed with   children shouldn  t play with dead things    low rent movie about low rent movie makers who wake the dead   trouble is  it  s nowhere near as entertaining or fun    the house of seven corpses   is dead at frame one  and spends the rest of its    minutes going through rigor mortis  dragging us along for every aching second               director sidney lumet has made some masterpieces like network dog day afternoon or serpico but he was not having too much luck on his most recent works gloria        was pathetic and find me guilty was an interesting but failed experiment now lumet brings his best film in decades and by my point of view a true masterpiece before the devil knows you  re dead i think this film is like a rebirth for lumet this movie has an excellent story which deeply has many layers also i think the ending of the movie is perfect the performances are brilliant philip seymour hoffman brings as usual a magnificent performance and he  s no doubt one of the best actors of our days ethan hawke is also an excellent actor but he  s underrated by my point of view his performance in here is great the rest of the cast is also excellent specially the great albert finney  but these two actors bring monumental performances which were sadly ignored by the pathetic oscars the film has a good level of intensity in part thanks to the performances and in part thanks to the brilliant screenplay before the devil knows you  re dead is a real masterpiece with perfect direction a great screenplay and excellent performances we need more movies like this             i took my    year old to see this movie  we left after    or    minutes  it was absolutely awful  this movie should be rated r at the least  i am not that strict with movies but  this was just too much  it was a waste of money  i thought it would contain some comedy and i knew the comedy would probably be crude but  this was way beyond crude  i was sitting there watching and reading  a certain subtitle at the beginning of the movie was what really got me  and i could not believe how crudely sexual it was  i could not believe that it would be ok for a    year old to read and see this content  i don  t understand how the rating system works               i loved this film  i thought it would be easy to watch  and easy to forget  i ran out after watching this to buy the dvd  obv not easily forgotten  br    br   the script is brilliant  and the casting couldn  t be more perfect  each character has their moment  and i laughed hard throughout this film  comedic timing was spot on  br    br               it  s not easy to find judas kiss on vhs  it  s not available on dvd   but i wanted to add this rather obscure movie to my alan rickman movie collection  br    br   i can  t understand how the talented mr  rickman gets into these mediocre films  judas kiss boasts several wonderful actors  an interesting plot and intriguing twists  but its strange visual wanderings and chopping editing ruined what might have been a great crime drama  many scenes seem to be missing vital information to explain the character  s actions  why was our hero immediately suspicious of his bosses  why did he mistrust the detective he replaced  there were times when i honestly couldn  t tell if the director meant judas kiss to be a legitimate crime drama or a campy spoof  why else would he toss in a topless alien lesbian porno scene in the first two minutes  that little surprise certainly made me scramble for the remote since my kids were playing nearby    did he purposely instruct his two distinguished english actors  alan rickman and emma thompson  to use such awful new orlean  s accents  as an alan freak  i confess that i still thought mr  rickman was sexy  in a rumpled  weary    take him home and tuck him in   sort of way  br    br   judas kiss isn  t a great movie  but it does have some intriguing moments  but i don  t recommend it unless you  re trying to immerse yourself in alan rickman             first of all  i should point out that i really enjoyed watching this documentary  not only it had great music in it  but the shots and the editing were also wonderful  however  all these positive things about the film does not change the fact that it plays to the orientalist   east meets west   clich   that bothers many turks like myself  okay  this film tells the story of traditional and contemporary turkish music in a very stylish manner which is a good thing  something that would show ignorant europeans and americans that this country is not just about murdering armenians and kurds  however  the problematic of the film is that it looks at what it defines as   east   from the eyes of the   west    i mean  like one jazz musician says in the film  maybe there is no east and west  maybe it is just a myth  a lie created by the ruling leaders of   western   countries in order to keep fear and hostility alive so that they could continue ruling the world and   keep the cash flowing     br    br   why don  t you think about that             stmd  is not a terrible movie  but it is quite forgettable  the lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest  so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye strain  special effects are imaginative  but obvious  the gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there  of course  along with the archetypical teenagers  but the whole movie just doesn  t gel  what was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue in cheek humor  br    br   i can  t really recommend that you use your time watching this movie  i often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor  but these are sadly lacking in this film             first off  i have no idea how this movie made it to the big screen  its not even the low budget sci fi channel movie  its just awful  me and my friend who love action movies  independence day  jurassic park  lotr  etc  went to see this movie expecting this movie to me a transformers with dragons  mindless entertainment  all we got was a mindless hour and a half  the cg was not as bad as i was expecting  but the plot is so awful along with the acting  it made up for it  its basically a chinese legged of dragons returning every     years   sounds like a good remake of rain of fire  no  the plot tries to be deeper than it should be leaving not only plot holes  but with magic  and a very small actual war between dragons rather big snakes  it just gets ridiculous  the director attempted to add a bit of humor in the movie which fail  me and my friend laughed through the whole thing along with all   of the audience   and cant believed we spent money on this  the short trailer on tv makes up for most of the action while crap makes up the rest  i  ve seen a lot of b movies like reptilian  the cave  spider  and others  but i have to say if you want a non stop laugh for an hour  watch this  br    br   story       cg       acting      br    br   i don  t drink   but it would have helped before watching this movie            i am not exactly how sure the accuracy is with this movie  but i can tell you that i was thoroughly entertained by this movie  the character of gust played perfectly by phillip seymour hoffman  was one of the most unique  yet entertaining characters in recent memory  this movie informed yet managed to avoid preaching to the audience  it made me laugh  made me sad  made me feel alive  and glad to be spending the time to watch the movie  it takes no time to understand what is going on  and takes you on a roller coaster ride of genuine  human emotion  i thought i knew my history  apparently i didn  t know it at all  i give this move   out of     and recommend it for all adults  and young adults  and the young at heart  just not the young  but as soon as they are allowed to see   r   rated movies  make it a priority             i must have seen this a dozen times over the years  i was about fifteen when i first saw it in b   w on the local pbs station  br    br   i bought a dvd set for the children to see  and am making them watch it  they don  t teach history in school  and this explains the most critical event of the   th century  it expands their critical thinking  br    br   impartially  with the participants on all sides explaining in their own words what they did and why  it details what lead up to the war and the actual war  br    br   buy it for your children  along with alistair cooke  s america  watch it with them  and make them understand  you  ll be so glad you did             steven seagal  s films of late have not exactly been good  but this is by far the worst since the patriot  the plot makes no sense what so ever  it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are  who works for who or who is double crossing who  the film is completely disjointed  each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward  even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow  most of the blame must lie at the director  s feet for not even understanding the basics of film making  but seagal does not get off lightly  as one of the producers of this film  he must also share the blame  oh  and i haven  t even mentioned how awful the acting is  even by seagal standards  even as straight to video fodder  this is not worth a view even for seagal fans  give it a wide berth             and i for one think that is a good thing  i  ve just never been a rosalind russell fan although the original was my favorite rr movie  but i love bette and was thrilled to hear she was making this  br    br   as for the rest of the production  i think it was slightly less than the original movie  one of my favorite minor characters in the original was mazeppa with her scratchy fingernails on the blackboard voice belting out   hey  it takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah    and although i missed it  i was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copy  br    br   i also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage  it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre  not just at the movies  br    br   i think the other thing i liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song   let me entertain you    which becomes completely annoying after about the  th time you hear it             so real and surreal  all in one  i remember feeling like tessa  heck  i remember being tessa  this was a beautiful vignette of a relationship ending  i especially liked the protesters tangent  it is nice to see symbolism in a movie without being smacked over the head with it  if you get the chance to see this  take it  it is well worth the    minutes             thank god i watched this at a friend  s place and did not pay for it  the plot is horribly transparent and the whole movie felt like an episode of a tv show  if you have any knowledge of computers or electronics  watch out  you will feel feel like the movie is an insult to your intelligence   br    br   also  actress turned much music vj amanda walsh displays the worst acting i have ever seen  excluding porn  she  s lucky that matt lanter is actually decent  he  s the one that carries the movie   br    br   i hate that i wasted nearly two hours of my life watching this movie  it  s a shame that they got to call it a sequel  because i was a fan of the original  which was actually pretty good             a friend lent me this dvd  which he got from the director at a festival  i think  i went in warned that some of the technical aspects of the movie were a bit shaky and that the writing was good but not great  so maybe that colored my judgment but i have to admit that i liked this movie  br    br   the standouts where the actors  youssef kerkor was really good as ernie  the main character  kind of pathetic in a likable way  adam jones  who also directed  and justin lane were excellent as the roommates who drive ernie mad  the bill character  justin lane   who spends a lot of the film dressed like a panda  was by far my favorite  he seemed the least one dimensional  and reminded me of an old college roommate so much i called the guy after watching the dvd  really kind of lovable  and very funny  some of the other acting was good  some was so so  but none of it was bad  i also really liked the vigilante duo  ridiculous and funny  br    br   i  m giving this one high marks  even though it has some issues  because you can tell when you watch it that these people cared  and decided to make their movie their way  well done to adam jones and crew             shawshank  godfather  pulp fiction    all good films  great films  but nothing  and i mean nothing lives up to the greatest christmas movie of all  santa claus  br    br   the film is so great and has so many messages  i cried while watching it  seriously  this is one of those movies you need to watch    times  when we see pitch get told he will have to eat ice cream  we see the sadness in his eyes  and we feel the deep sorrow  and then we wonder    what is so bad about this ice cream  is it implying that we as humans are treating ice cream as good when all it does is make us evil  think movie makes you think  br    br   this movie has the best rendition of santa claus ever  unlike other santas  he is a normal person  we see him imprisoning children and spying on kids dreams  and we wonder  is the santa we believe in really that good  also  this santa actually mentions christ  the whole meaning behind christmas  br    br   you owe yourself to watch this cinematic masterpiece  we should just stop making movies and air nothing but this epic       whether it  s christmas or not  this movie gets a         whoever says this movie is bad is an ignorant fool            i really cant think of anything good to say about this film   not a single thing  the script is a nightmare   the writer blurs the line between chemical and biological traits and doesnt seem to understand the difference  you d think they would at least get a technical advisor  the performances were bad by most of the cast    although i dont really blame them   the material really stinks  the editing was equally bad   i ll just stop now   its all bad                cinema  s greatest period started in post war europe with italy  s neo realist movement  during the next   or   decades that followed  france  s new wavers caught everyone  s attention  and there was always bergman up there on his desolate scandinavian island somewhere  making bitter masterpieces  but in       luchino visconti brought the art form to full circle  geographically speaking  with his miraculous work  death in venice   which might as well be called  the death of europoean cinema   after the sixties wound down  so did the great european filmmakers  who  with some exceptions  generally grew exhausted and passed the torch to a new american generation of movie brats  coppola  scorsese    co    this movie absolutely feels like a grand summing up  not just of visconti  s particular obsessions  but of the general attempt of european filmmakers to achieve the aesthetic ideal in movies  and rest assured  you will find no sterner task master than the visconti revealed here  he  s not playing to the crowd  folks  either you get behind him and follow along  or you get left behind  the pacing is a challenge  slow  but never without emotional weight    incidents   are few and far between  but each seems loaded with symbolic significance in a sturm und drang cosmos  br    br   we will probably never be in such rarefied company again  in terms of the movies  one of the century  s great writers who inspired the tale  thomas mann   one of the greatest filmmakers directing it  visconti   one of the greatest actors in the lead role  dirk bogarde   and swelling almost ceaselessly in the background  gustav mahler  s  th symphony  taking full advantage of mahler  s ability to inspire romanticism in even the most cynical breast  visconti changes the main character  aschenbach  into a decrepit composer from his original persona as a writer  even making bogarde up to look like mahler  geeky mustache  specs  shaggy hair  duck like walk   bogarde  by the way  delivers what is probably greatest performance of an actor in the history of movies  it  s a largely silent performance  and the actor has to deliver reams of meaning in a gesture or a glance    a difficult trick without mugging like chaplin or merely acting like an animated corpse  br    br   cinema just doesn  t get better than this  i  ll ignore the complaints from the ritalin addicts out there who say that it  s too slow  but even the more legitimate gripe concerning some of aschenbach  s flashbacks with that antagonistic friend of his is misplaced  the flashbacks fit neatly within the movie  s thematic concerns  i e   which is the better path to aesthetic perfection  passion or discipline    and the suddenness and shrillness of these interruptions serve to prevent sleepiness among the viewers   of course  some viewers will sleep through this movie  anyway   a nonstop stream of mahler and beautiful  dying venice would be nothing more than a pretty picture  but this movie is actually about something  and what it  s mostly about is suffering  romantic  capital r  suffering  in particular  as a suffering romantic himself  visconti knew whereof he spoke  br    br    spoiler       i guess  if for nothing else  see  death in venice  for its portentous opening credits       and for its unforgettable ending  with bogarde  s jet black hair dye dripping off of his sweaty  dying head and onto his chalk white face  meanwhile  off in the distance  young tadzio  the object of bogarde  s dying desire  stands in the ocean and points toward the horizon like a michelangelo sculpture  the climatic sequence sums up with agonizing economy everything that the movie is about  love  lust  beauty  loss  the ending of a life set against the beginning of another life  and cold death in the midst of warm  sunny beauty   death in venice  is a miraculous work of art   br    br    dvd tip  as with the simultaneously released visconti masterpiece  the damned   i recommend that you turn the english subtitles on while watching this movie  it  s ostensibly in english  but the dvd  s sound seems muddy and there  s a lot of italian spoken during the film  anyway    br    br               this is a stereotype plot  a young fighter tries to enter a competition when he is not ready and is not selected to represent his fighting school  this leads to separation from the fighting school and naturally he finds a strange new master to teach him to fight  br    br   the fights are not of high standards  they are way too   simple   in a way that     is simple to every adult  the fighter has trained and enters the ring  but does not do what he trained and gets an ass kicking  the coach yells do this and do that with no success  and after some more of this ridiculous beating he suddenly does what he is told and hits his opponent once  this results in a turning point in the fight  although our hero has been taking a beating of his life up until that point  think about the rocky movies and you  ll have a good point of reference of how much beating he really takes  the fights are also shot poorly  br    br   there final thing that screws this film up is the stupid romance  cheesy music and awkward moments are not what i call entertainment  br    br   these guys really could have made some quality entertainment  but the director wasn  t up to the task  or the other crew in my opinion  maybe they had a small budget  i don  t know  but what matters in the end is that this movie is bad and deserves the rating of   out of                this production was quite a surprise for me  i absolutely love obscure early   s movies  but i wasn  t prepared for the last    minutes of this story  if  by any chance  you  re not convinced in the first half  hang in there for the finale  of course  you must look at the blatant racism as being purely topical  a fascinating viewing experience  but i think the cat  s paw is not available on video dvd yet  watch your pbs listings             it isn  t too bad  but ultimately it lacks the quality that the australian series has  br    br   the jokes are few and far between  the actors are attractive  they shouldn  t be   the film makers think far too much about the cinematography  it  s supposed to look like a home video  and it  s just like a serious version of kath and kim    it  s stupid  br    br   it  s too normal to be kath and kim  kath and kim are supposed to be two curvy  middle aged women who think they are hot and wear ridiculous clothes  there are no   look at me kimmy    jokes  the fat friend of kim is not fat at all and she  s not even slightly stupid  she  s a stereotypical black latino chick  br    br   it  s just not as stupid or funny as the australian series  it doesn  t compare  nothing is the same  i admit  this show is pretty funny at times  but it is not anything like the aussie series  i was looking forward to an american take on a bogan family  they failed  it  s supposed to be really stupid and hilarious  but the actors don  t act stupid  to me  this is just a typical american tv show  it  s a let down if you want it to be anything like the aussie show  br    br     stars because it is an okay show  just nothing like what it should be             from the decrepit ranks of the already over saturated   hillybilly horror   sub genre comes this woeful tale of a vacationing family terrorized by inbred rednecks  sound familiar  well it most definitely should to anyone with even a cursory knowledge of the horror genre  there is absolutely new here  the film seems content to recycle all thee old worn out clich  s  deformed hicks  a peaceful family turned gun toting killers when push comes to show  the rebellious daughter  the one   freak   who  s good at heart  etcetera      but does even that half heartedly enough to make this an utter waste of time  this is forgettable dreck  but humorously enough lead j d  hart once starred in a movie called   films that suck   earlier in his career  quite an ironic omen indeed  br    br   my grade  d             as a huge baseball fan  my scrutiny of this film is how realistic it appears  dennis quaid had all of the right moves and stances of a major league pitcher  it is a fantastic true story told with just a little too much   disney   for my taste             this film takes you on one family  s impossible journey  and makes you feel every step of their odyssey  beautifully acted and photographed  heartbreakingly real  its last line  with its wistful hope  is one of the more powerful in memory             stupid  stupid  stupid  i can not stand ben stiller anymore  how this man is allowed to still make movies is beyond me  i can  t understand how this happens if i performed at work the way he acts in a movie i  d get fired and i own the company     i would have to fire myself  god  this movie was just a plain  steaming  stinking pile of poo  that needs to be vapoorized if that were possible  something else i have to say the guideline about    lines of text in a comment is idiotic  what is wrong with just saying a few things about a movie  i will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary             this show is great for many reasons  the father and mother can communicate with their kids this day in age  its so great to see a real family instead of some stuffy overacting family  i watched this one time and became hooked it so great to see a black family on tv worth watching  this show left too soon but on its way out it dealt with pregnancy  sexy  drugs  bad dates death etc  the best thing about the show was that it dealt with it in a real humorous sort of way  great show for the family   i cant tell you how many times i have sat up watched this show late at night sometimes and laughed my head off  great pg    rated show i loved everybit of this show             this film is where the batman franchise ought to have stopped  though i will concede that the ideas behind   batman forever   were excellent and could have been easily realised by a competent director  as it turned out this was not to be the case  br    br   apparently warner brothers executives were disappointed with how dark this second batman film from tim burton turned out  apart from the idiocy of expecting anything else from burton  and the conservative cowardice of their subsequent decision to turn the franchise into an homage to the sixties tv series  i fail to understand how   batman returns   can be considered at all disappointing  br    br   true  it is not quite the equal of the first film   though it repairs all the minor deficiencies of style found in   batman    a weaker script that splits the antagonism between not just two but three characters invites unflattering comparisons to the masterful pairing of keaton and jack nicholson as the joker in the first film  yet for all this it remains a gorgeously dark film  true to the way the batman was always meant to be  and highly satisfying  br    br   michael keaton returns as the batman and his alter ego bruce wayne  tangling with nouveau riche tycoon max schreck  christopher walken  named in honour of the     s german silent actor   his partner in crime oswald cobblepot  the penguin  danny devito in brilliant makeup reminiscent of laurence olivier  s   richard iii     and selina kyle  the catwoman  michelle pfeiffer   whom wayne romances both as himself and as the batman  the four principals turn in excellent performances  especially walken and devito  while together keaton and pfeiffer explore the darker side of double identities  br    br   there are some intriguing concepts in this film  about the only weakness i can really point out is a certain limpness to the script in some places  which i think is due mostly to the way this film is a four cornered fight  there simply isn  t enough time to properly explore what  s going on  br    br   nevertheless  this is a damn good film  i highly recommend watching this in conjunction with the first  and then weeping for how good the series could have been had it continued under burton and keaton             the quick and the undead is  finally  the first movie to actually render its own storyline null and void  it is  essentially  one gigantic plot hole  br    br   aside from that  the acting was quite bad  character motivations nonexistent or unbelievable and there wasn  t a single character worth hanging our hat on  the most interesting cast member  who had great potential to be a dark horse protagonist  got snuffed halfway through the proceedings  br    br   what the quick and the undead does serve as is an excellent example of how to do good color timing  it looked excellent  when you take into account budget considerations  br    br   unfortunately  it plays out like a guy got his hands on a hundred grand and watched a few westerns  most notably the good  the bad and the ugly  and then just threw a bunch of elements haphazardly into a movie      you know  they have movies where characters do this  does it fit here  no  but who cares  they do it in other movies so i should do it here     br    br   maybe a good view for burgeoning cinematographers and colorists  first year film schoolers   otherwise  a must miss             i was stunned by this film  afterwards  i didn  t even want to see any films for a long time  any other film would be so unsatisfying by comparison  br    br   for many  it may be the worst of antonioni  very slow  without an engaging conventional story line  microscopic examinations of human emotions and interactions  and the worst of wenders  verbose  confused transcendentalism  it is composed of short distinct episodes linked by wenders   typical meandering hero  s stream of consciousness  so it doesn  t produce the temporary oblivion of escapist cinema  br    br   but for fans  the worst is the best and the disjointed story line is sketching a single poetic image that stretches across the film  wenders and antonioni create a discourse between their segments that seeks out the heart of things  br    br               am i the only person who thinks that the entire forensics and scenes of crime community in the usa must detest this almighty slap in their faces  a rookie cop is first to a crime scene where her back up is so slow to respond that she has time to send the kid who found the body to the local store to buy a disposable camera  by the time he returns  still no senior cops  socos or other assistance for the lovely jolie   this is new york isn  t it    it has started raining and she gets to work photographing the evidence  only after she  d stood in front of an amtrak to stop it disturbing the scene  br    br   i want to know the name of that camera as the photographs were so incredibly detailed that no amount of zooming in distorted the images   the horror continues   not in the film itself  pretty ordinary i  m afraid  but in the lincoln rhyme character as played by mr washington  this man is a highly dedicated forensic crime scene examiner with years of experience who  instead of the highly trained but invisible local crime scene examiners  entrusts the work to an untrained cop  a rookie cop  who proceeds to find the very obviously placed clues and move them before photographing them thus contaminating every item and making dna profiling well nigh impossible  now that was a bright idea eh  i know one should be able to suspend disbelief to a degree but those who say this film is intelligent must have entirely disengaged their ability to think in order to find this film believable  br    br   i have given this film      for the superb acting of denzel washington and for miss jolie  s lips which are the only items requiring my disbelief to be suspended             the one of the most remarkable sci fi movies of the millennium  not only a movie but an incredible future vision  this movie establishes a new standard of s f movies  hail and kill             this is the second hitchcock film to appear on the list and the second hitchcock film i  ve seen in full  the first was rope  which i really enjoyed  with saboteur hitchcock was more room to roam free  whereas rope took place all in one room  i didn  t enjoy this one as much as rope but that  s not saying this is a bad film  it just seems like an average flick that could have been something more  br    br   it seems like a film hitchcock would make as a break in between his more serious ones  as a thriller  i feel it fails to really get my on the edge of my seat or engaged with the lead character who is running around the states  the climax of the film feels like a miss opportunity to really amp up the tension  the sound design is almost non existent  you can hear their dialogue and a bit of the environment around them  but the important things are missing  the stitches ripping apart from the sleeve  the need of music to amp of the tension  all missing  intentional no doubt  yet it lacks the emotional punch one would want from such a scene  then it ends abruptly leaving you empty inside  br    br   the film doesn  t feel like it should either  they are almost globe trotting from place to place  yet it feels more confined  the script itself is very average and seems to go about the more obtuse ways to get the plot moving  br    br   the performances are there  but nothing amazing  everyone plays their parts to scripted words on the page  the relationship between the two leads is weak and needed more work  the one stand out is otto kruger  who has that rich  ego  evil persona down pat  br    br   in the end  i wanted more from this one  i understand it  s one of hitchcock  s least exciting films  but i did have a good time watching it  i can recommend it  just not enthusiastically             it is always difficult to bring a     pages book down to a three hours film  i read the book before  and i found the bbc production dealing with this difficulty in the best way possible  the qualities of the book haven  t been lost  the dense and lively depiction of a fingersmith patchwork family in london in the     s  the cold and obscene cruelty in which maud is brought up  the characterization of different social groups by different ways of speaking  the unexpected and surprising twists of the story  the way the film makes the spectators look different at the same scenes when they are told first from sue  s point of view then from maud  s one  the main actors do very good  and especially the growing love between the two women is convincingly developed  with a first culmination in a very tender love scene between the two and finally forgiving all the evil they were ready to do and did to each other  because they still love each other  br    br   for each of her books the author  sarah waters  has thoroughly investigated what life was like in british   th century  while in tipping the velvet it was the world of the vaudeville theaters and the beginning of social movements  in affinity the dreadful reality of women penitentiaries and the fashionable evocation of spirits  in fingersmith she depicts the public ceremony of hanging people in london and the inhuman treatment of persons supposed or declared disturbed in asylums based on the reading of sources and scientific research  this is very well transferred to the film so that the corresponding scenes show a high grade of historic truth  i highly recommend this film production because it offers three hours of colorful victorian atmosphere  vivid emotions  and suspense             this is one of my all time favorite cheap  corny  vampire b movies   br    br   calvin klein underwear model   oh  i mean  stefan the good vampire  returns to transylvania to ascend the throne of vampiric royalty  but manicure impaired and eternally drooling half brother radu has other plans  having killed their father the vampire king  radu now sets his sights on stefan  stefan  s new mortal girlfriend michelle and her two pretty friends  and the all powerful bloodstone  br    br   okay  the scenery is beautiful  and it should be as it was shot on location in transyl fricken vania for gosh sakes  the actresses are no great shakes and stefan the heroic vampire is about as charming as a refrigerated fireplace poker  but who cares  there  s only one reason to watch this movie  and his name is radu  he  s a physical homage to nosferatu and he has the best lines in the movie  all spoken in the raspy voice of a man who smokes ten packs of cigarettes a day  the cemetery festival scene is one of the best scenes in the film  as radu slowly approaches the camera and reveals his grinning  slobbering face for the world to see  i found myself cheering him on as he collected victims and taunted his perfect brother  but maybe i  m just a sicko  questionable taste in men aside  i highly recommend this film to vampire enthusiasts  it  s original  it  s fun  and radu is one of the best vampires i  ve seen in a long time   much more fun than the stiff  tragic  whining undead brats that endlessly grace the horror screens these days  radu enjoys his sadism and never apologizes  he  s what a vampire should be             let me first off say that i am a believer of ghosts  and i do indeed know they exist  i have had enough experiences with them to know they are there  br    br   what i hate is the people who bring the bible and religion into all of this  people forget there is more than one   bible    thousands of religions and beliefs  and different ways to interpret what is said in the bible  not everyone believes in god  and not everyone believes in stereo typical religion   br    br   religion does not make everything fact  one of the things i should mention in the bible that many do not know is that even the most rampant bible thumper is breaking the very rules written within    you are supposed to never wear more than one fabric at one time  slavery is ok  and you may murder your neighbor under certain circumstances  none of this    oh that was the old testament  and now we have the new testament    if the bible is the word of god  and cannot be changed  there should be no changes  or versions  religion is full of misinterpretations  mixed facts  and people who so blindly follow it that there    is no other way    the excuses these said blind followers use are either pathetic  or they themselves cannot explain the discrepancies properly  and instead use excuses handed down to them from either their pastor or teacher   br    br   but anyhow  onto the review  i am a decent fan of   ghost hunters   and when i heard this show was coming soon  i was pretty excited and thought it had some potential  as much as i like watching   ghost hunters    i do not like some of their members  and i do not like the way they can dismiss a place as being haunted  yet cannot explain anything that is going on  just because your investigation equipment does not pick it up  does not mean the camera filming the show did not  i am glad they are skeptical  but it  s like they do not understand that just because you did not get anything on your recorder and film does not make the place haunted or not  if ghosts were that easy to capture  it would be known as a fact  not a belief  it  s more of a   right place at the right time   kind of thing  as well as if there is something there  what makes you think it  s going to   perform   for you  this show is kind of silly  it  s usually boring  and there is lots of talk  lots of psychics  yet hardly anything happens  the main guy  s filtered narration is usually either boring to listen to  or is basically not needed  br    br   also  the reliance on psychics is too abundant  as i believe very few of them are actually gifted  silvia brown is one i definitely believe in  but most are sometimes hard to believe  br    br   i really wanted to like this show  but of the few i have seen i have yet to be terribly impressed             for a long time    the menagerie   was my favorite   star trek   episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by   city on the edge of forever    what i used to prefer about   menagerie   was that it  s more hard core star trek with this fascinating back story to the then current trek storyline  i still think it  s fairly ingenious the way gene roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a two part episode  though the   new   part of the story is largely an excuse for kirk and a few others  and us  to watch the pilot  the idea of spock being court martialed is a clever one  you can poke holes in the plot if you want  for instance  given the talosians   mind control abilities and captain pike  s condition  why is it even necessary to physically bring pike back to their planet  and there are other confusing questions about pike and commodore mendez    best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy st  s only two parter             coen brothers wannabe from writer director paul chart relies far too much on ideas lifted from other  better  movies  yet does manage to create a creepy atmosphere that keeps one watching  robert forster cuts loose as never before playing a psychopathic psychiatrist  ha ha  who goes on a killing spree in the desert  the film is unusual  but in its attempt to keep one step ahead of the audience  it becomes alienating and off putting  with a role for amanda plummer that is downright humiliating   an admittedly bravura finale  many quirky bits of business  and forster looking great in the nude  make this a curiosity item  nothing more  veteran movie director irvin kershner produced  and maybe should directed as well  could paul chart be a pseudonym         from                 when it was released this film caused a sensation  i watched it and was thrilled  beautiful  usually young  naked women filmed in the classy style we knew so well from director hamiltons photography  his photographs never become porn and the same is true for this movie  today i saw it again and was bitterly disappointed  the soft core in extremely slow paced scenes  all filmed with some vaseline on the lenses  actually is all there is  there is no real story  the characters remain beautiful and beautifully filmed bodies  but they are not real creatures with a soul  actually nothing happens  it is like hamilton is photographing using moving pictures rather than stills  and this gets so boring after a while  i even didn  t watch the whole thing the second time  for i fell vast asleep  that is all that remains of this masterpiece  it is a very good sleeping pill  and you will never become addicted to it  br    br   back then   out of     now   out of               largely forgettable tale in which mercenary kerman   employer agren travel into the jungle in search of agren  s missing sister  br    br   despite its connection to the cannibal movie family  this film is more of an extreme version of rene cardona  s   guyana   crime of the century    lenzi clearly aims to exploit the  at that time  topical jonestown massacre  by depicting a rogue  self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania  played with ruthless intensity by ivan rassimov  leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion  with sister in toe  kerman   agren attempt to stop the rot  but after several failed coups  they end up fleeing into the   green inferno    only to run afoul the locals and their notorious appetites  br    br   one in a string of excessive gore fests that emerged in the late seventies early eighties  where every new addition seemed to engage in a one upmanship contest with its predecessor  by attempting to contrive the most gory and graphic display ever brought to motion pictures  this inferior instalment employs all the motifs and gimmicks of the others  but with much less success  br    br   was it the so called   amazonian natives   who looked like they were bollywood rejects  this film was made on location in sri lanka   or the inept   decapitation   and   castration   scenes that seriously diminished the authenticity that was apparent in   cannibal holocaust    you can decide  without spoiling the conclusion  it appeared as though lenzi put more emphasis in his shock and awe climax than in the basic requirement for a cohesive ending  where all loose ends are resolved  most unsatisfying  br    br   as with the others  where the extent of the graphic depictions of violence toward humans is limited  thankfully   the filmmakers have spared no extreme in inflicting the worst possible cruelty on hapless animals in their pursuit of the most sadistic shocks  unfortunately  the only thing shocking about this film is that it rates a mention among others of the ilk  that deal with the subject matter more convincingly  br    br   if there are any redeemable features at all  kerman is an affable if somewhat one dimensional leading man  and his bevy of scantily clad co stars  agren  lai and senatore  provide some visual respite from the relentless slayings             get smart should be titled get stupid  there is not one funny line or gag in the entire film  this film is so bad it makes the austin powers films look shakespearean  a few more films like this and steve carell can kiss his career goodbye  as for anne hathaway  what is she doing in this film  she  s a good actress but is just plain terrible  br    br   the writing is pathetically lame  there is not one funny  clever  or witty line  there is not one good sight gag  br    br   the directing is terrible  comedy relies on timing  someone should tell the director that  every line that is supposed to be funny  and isn  t  is delivered with absolutely the worst sense of comic timing i  ve ever seen  br    br     stars            herculis puaro is  in general  a well established   hero   we know well from books and movies  this movie or this story don  t work and i felt its not agatha  s mistake  the cast isn  t good  the actors are over exaggerating and making foolish gestures  the costumes are so clean and tidy that everything  even arab clothes  look fake and for the serious spectator who thinks twice this movie can be seen as a comedy instead of mystery drama  the actor playing herculis puaro is doing a nice job but nothing fantastic  the scenes are  as said before  perfect and looking fake  the story is not very enchanting although a mystery of murder but who cares about the death of a loony and vicious blond     woman in the iraqi desert   the   victim   is not likable            how can so many blundering decisions can be made  all that waste of resources its an idiotic story to begin with but theres no need to make it worse a loose interpretation  are you kidding  it diminishes my regard for voight and coburn i hope they were paid well            this was by far the worst movie i  ve ever seen  and thats compared to alexander  fortress   and the new world  br    br   i should go back to blockbuster and ask for my money back along with compensation as it was a truly traumatic experience  for the first ten minutes i was changing the zoom on my widescreen tv because the actors seemed to be out of screen  i didn  t think it was possible to make such a bad film in this day and age  i was wrong  while typing this message  i  ve thought of a good reason to buy this movie  a joke present at xmas  i  m blaming the mrs for this one as she picked it  thanks babe  br    br   be warned       a true shocker all round                  if you  ve read mother night and enjoyed it so much  as i did  that you just have to see the movie  understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of vonngut  s writing   that beyond his story lies vonnegut himself  and that you can  t put a human mind on the screen  his whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance  i believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that vonnegut poses in his book  but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen  does this mean that the movie misses the mark  of course not  in my opinion  the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book  this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page   it succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of america  s true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense  i  ve seen other movie versions of vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel vonnegut  s genius and loses grip on his own craft  i would not place this movie as one of the best i  ve seen  but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching  by taking vonnegut  s   voice   out of the movie  s narration or trying to insert it however it can  mother night tells his story brilliantly  and preserves the story  s fundamental lessons without confusion  distraction  or disappointment             this is one of the worst movies  i  ve ever seen  not only  that it is a comedy  which isn  t funny  but it  s also very badly made with an over the top direction full of unnecessary split screens and other effects  br    br   the two   heroes   with their fantasy language are just annoying and it confused me quite a lot  that they touched each others genitals all the time  but the worst of all that nonsense is the cheap attempt to give that movie some appeal  by referring to german history and to show sensitive aspects of the   heroes    which finds its climax in showing how erkan and stefan cure a mentally ill woman with their   joyful   lifestyle      but i hadn  t expect anything better by director michael   bully   herbig  who also made two not funny tv shows  a not funny western movie and a nearly not funny sf comedy movie  but erkan and stefan had been  just a little  better in some of their stand up programs  for me the only good thing about the movie is alexandra neldel  who is very beautiful to me             i sat through this on tv hoping because of the names in it that it would be worth the time   but dear gussie  whoever thought this script was worth producing  the basic idea is excellent but the execution is appallingly bad  with a constantly illogical sequence of scenes  an ending that is almost laughably melodramatic and poor rock hudson wanders through this with an understandably confused look on his slightly sagging face  looks like a bad b movie from the     s               a number of contributors have mentioned the age difference between stewart and novak  she was    and he was    when this movie was released  i think that the difference didn  t matter for a suspense drama like vertigo  but it does matter for a romantic comedy  we can easily understand  that is  why his character would be attracted to hers  but it  s less clear why hers would be attracted to his  br    br   still  the movie works as a light romantic fantasy  the scene where she stares at him across the cat  s head  with her dark painted on eyebrows flaring and the sounds of her humming and the cat purring  is true magic  it  s a little jarring  therefore  when the scene shifts to the top of the flatiron building  and we see the age difference very sharply  as he embraces her  she reaches up to run her fingers through his hair  but stops that motion and just brushes her fingertips lightly against his toupee             family problems abound in real life and that is what this movie is about  love can hold the members together through out the ordeals and trials and that is what this movie is about  one man  daddy  has the maturity and fortitude to sustain the family in the face of adversity  the kids grow up one all be it  in the hard way  to realize that no matter how old they or a parent is  the parent still loves their children and are willing to provide them a cushion when they fall  all the actors portraying their characters did outstanding performances  yes  i shed a tear along the way knowing i had had similar experiences both as a young adult and later as a parent  this true to life is one which every young adult  and parent  would do well to see  although some will not realize it until they too are parents  a must see for those who care about their families             the only conceivable flaw of this film is it  s title   please stop comparing it to the first  i did in my previous review only to separate it from the first  if you haven  t seen the movie and are curious  totally forget about the first and invent a different name for this  there is nothing alike and has a mood all its own  this is a great exponent of screwy mid   s comedy  i seriously doubt such big names in this cast did the movie because they were broke or even wanted to remake the first  anybody who ever wanted to give a kick to the snobbish aristocracy should love this little opus  i maintain  the only reason this is in the imdb bottom     is because of its title  i usually hate movies like these  i e  adam sandler  will farrell  farrelly bros       but this movie just keeps me laughing hysterically  i dunno  maybe it  s like a bad relationship i can  t get out of or just a ridiculous guilty pleasure  either way  this is the single most underrated movie of the   s behind   the stunt man    br    br   robert stack  we love you                           salva and his pal bigardo have been at the margin of the law during most of their lives  we see them panhandling in a car of the underground  where their pitch to get donations is so lame  no one gives them anything  salva  who is a hardened petty criminal doesn  t even have any redeeming qualities  that is  until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of what to do next  religion and show business prove to be a winning combination  something that salva capitalizes on  br    br   he and bigardo have been in jail after the accidental death of a priest that was critical of the duo  salva shows he is a natural for the reality show  he transforms himself into a christ like figure who is an instant success in the program  espe  who is a no nonsense woman who is show  s producer  can  t escape from the way salva pays her unusual attention  ultimately  salva is the victim of his own success in the end  br    br   jordi molla  whose first directorial job this movie is  had some success in the way the film satirizes the role of television  spain  which was vulnerable to these types of programs  has seen its share of the bizarre  which is what the director felt is an assault on the viewing public and wanted to set his story from the point of view of the people that are making a fortune out of the naive audience  br    br   the ensemble cast has some good moments in the film  mr  molla  like any actor who decides to direct his first feature  would have been more effective concentrating on the picture in front of the camera  candela pena  a good actress  is one of the best reasons for watching the movie  juan carlos villedo  david gimenez cacho  franco francescoantonio  florinda chico and the rest responded well to the new director             these kinda movies just don  t get the credit they deserve  this is my  nd all time favorite movie   stand by me being  st   the reason i watched this movie was because wil wheaton was in it and he is my most favorite person in the whole world and i think he done an amazing job in this movie and so did sean astin  i just watched it last night actually and it just amazed me  everything in the movie is very exceptional  the script  the acting  the screenplay  i was on the edge of my seat     of the time  and if my mom wasn  t in the room i would have absolutely balled whenever joey trotta  wil wheaton  died  i did not see that coming   at all   i was real surprised when i heard that it wasn  t real popular back in the     s  i was born a few years after it came out so  of course  i didn  t go see it in the theaters  but im sure i would have if i would have been alive  if any of my friends watched this  they would be like    uhh okay    but thats just cause their not cool enough to appreciate work like this  if you haven  t seen this movie  or are wanting to watch something that is the bomb  this is the movie for you to watch             as a big time prince fan of the last three to four years  i really can  t believe i  ve only just got round to watching   purple rain    the brand new   disc anniversary special edition led me to buy it  wow  i was really looking forward to watching it  but i wasn  t prepared for just how electric it actually is  prince  s musical performances throughout the movie are nothing short of astounding   he really has the moves in this one  i am very familiar  from repeated listens  with the classic   purple rain   album and all its songs  but to see them in the context of the movie completely alters your perception of the tunes and lyrics   like computer blue  the beautiful ones  when doves cry and purple rain itself  there is something indescribably hypnotising about the scenes where prince and the revolution perform  the closing songs baby i  m a star and i would die for u show how much energy and sheer talent prince was brimming with in his mid   s  he  s overflowing    it blew me away  it even makes michael jackson seem inanimate even in his peak years  br    br   prince shows you how to win the girl of your dreams   drive her to a lake  make her jump in  then drive off   absolutely hilarious stuff in hindsight  br    br   some of the scenes are very     s and unintentionally hilarious but this adds to the film  s overall charm  morris day is the coolest cat on the block  and hilarious   and when his group the time perform the bird you get to see morris day and jerome benton light up the stage minneapolis funk style   i love their dancing in this bit  and how benton provides morris with a mirror mid performance  br    br   i already can  t wait to watch it again  i really can  t  extras are terrific   particularly seeing a young eddie murphy pre beverly hills cop admit he is a   prince groupie               a good ol   boy film is almost required to have moonshine  car chases  a storyline that has a vague resemblance to   plot   and at least one very pretty country gal  barefoot with short shorts and a low top  the pretty gal is here  dressed in designer jeans    but the redneck prerequisites stop there  jimmy dean is a natural as a sausage spokesman but as a tough guy former sheriff  he comes up way short  big john is big  but he isn  t convincing with the   bad   part of his moniker  bug eyed jack elam is a hoot as always and bo hopkins has been playing this same part for decades  ned beatty also does his part in a small role    but there is no story  it smells more like an episode of in the heat of the night than a feature film  cornball cornpone with easily predictable sentiment  perhaps the most glaring problem with this movie is charlie daniels singing the theme  you know the one  it was made famous by    jimmy dean             after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb  i was extremely pleased with the film  the film was dark  moving  the anger  the pain  the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon  br    br   i had initially expected to see many special effects  and like a lover  s caress  it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it  brian  i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects  you will go a long way  my friend  i will definitely be the president of your fan club  br    br   eric etebari  the best actor award  was the number one choice  you made jr  lopez look like a child compared to kasadya      br    br   overall  the acting  story line  the high quality filming and awesome effects  it was fantastic  i just wish it were longer  i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations             but it is kinda hilarious  at least if you grew up on weird al  like i did  it  s a mockumentary about his life and career  beginning with superstardom and going back to trace the origins  it  s uneven in places  but some of the segments are still very funny  particularly when he goes to japan  although it  s not quite as emotionally textured as lost in translation  and he doesn  t find love however fleeting  he does capture in a bottle the absolutely bizarre cultural melange that is tokyo street life  br    br   perhaps weird al isn  t recognized as the insightful cultural commentator that he is  perhaps a rose by any other name would smell just as sweet  still  this is a funny movie             one of the two best films of the year  a well filmed  well written  well put together film with an outstanding cast  lau ching wan and his friends  dayo wong chi wa  anthony wong chau sun  francis ng chun yu  jordan chan siu chun  cheung man tat  had great chemistry before the film and their friendship shows in their performances  theresa lee plays her comedic role well  though much like a female version of michael wong  her gag seems to be the foreign born chinese surrounded by native hkers    and i found myself cheering for innovative explosive scenes  something i haven  t done since    the fan boys took over alt asian movies and    john woo  s hardboiled  sure the ending was expected  but i feel better cheering for cops than a bunch of young gang members  highly enjoyable            i managed to see this at the new york international film festival in november      with my boyfriend  we were both quite impressed with the complexity of the plot and found it to be emotionally moving  it was very well directed with strong imagery  the visual effects were amazing   especially for a short  it had an original fantasy approach to a very real and serious topic  this film is about a young girl who is visited by a demon offering to help her situation with her abusive father  there is also a surprise twist at the end which caught me off guard  this leans towards the gothic feel  i would love to see this as a full feature film     carrie           why else would he do this to me  br    br   not that i expect dean cain to produce hit movies  or even decent movies  i saw lois and clark  i am aware of just how      good   dean cain is  br    br   obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick  and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head  i will not call these spoilers as you can  t really spoil this movie any more than it already is  br    br   to begin with    why is that a fake helicopter  i mean    why  br    br   how come that one scientist is from chicago and that other scientist is from la and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried  how hard would it have been to get either an american actor  or just change that lame state sheet the movie provides us with to say those people aren  t american  br    br   why are there   occasions when the movie gives us a slug line  we get helipad day and then mess hall day later on  and then that  s it  who cares about the timeline  to be honest  who cared about it even when they mentioned it  but i guess that  s beside the point  br    br   does a movie really get better if you are able to view it through multiple split screens  the answer is no  br    br   that dragon sure can walk down that hall  over  and over   and over    and over    br    br   who on earth was responsible for one of the worst endings in film history  it was straight out of scooby doo  oh  the dragon  s dead now   say  wanna get dinner  sure  but not at some chinese place    with dragon in the name   ah ha ha ha   ha ha ha   haha ha  i used to be superman  aha ha ha  ha ha  br    br   fade to black br    br   my god  it made me cringe it was so stupid  br    br   but never fear  even though the whole building exploded   and no one was left alive  for some reason there  s a second untouched  unmanned lab that survived pretty well  so they can make a sequel  hurray for us all  br    br               minimal script  minimal character development  minimal steady camera  maximum stretched scenes  maximum headache inducing jerky zooms  maximum characters walking around in the woods doing nothing  up until the time flashes on the screen of      pm  you can fast forward and miss nothing  since there are three hunters who we know nothing about doing nothing  to be fair  the movie does have some string music that was interesting  so perhaps a music video would have been the way to go with this  unfortunately that was not to be  and what should have been a twenty minute short is stretched beyond belief  forget about   trigger man    i know i am trying to    merk            a wonderful film ahead of its time  br    br   i think so  in the eighty  s it was all about winning  greed is good   remember that one   i have seen this film more that    times  to me this is a real desert island film  i keep watching because there is always something more to learn about these flawed characters that i just love  jessica tandy  and hume cronin  are simply wonderful also beverly d  angelo  beau bridges come in at a close second  don  t get me wrong there are many more great performance  s in this film  and it is also the way it is written that made it for me  and i hope you  a film that you will want to see over and over  i think tv shows like   northen exposure    and now   earl   owe a lot to this film  but remember it is not a tom cruise film            it got switched off before the opening credits had even finished appearing  the first joke was just so appallingly lame and dreadfully acted that it had to go  you shouldn t really decide to watch this based on my review or not  i saw so little of it i shouldn t even really be commenting but suddenly it all became clear why the video shop guy was sniggering at us paying money to see it  br    br   couldn t they have just made earnest does dallas           this is one of the more unromantic movies i have ever seen  br    br   casting  richard gere is just too old looking for romantic lead roles anymore  diane looks a bit eager to please and frowning as usual but she seems unconvinced by the romance herself  supporting cast not too memorable  br    br   story  the medical drama he has to deal with is unconvincing and is not interesting  the story is weak   not enough happens to make a movie about  there is nothing new to say or no new way to say it here   br    br   the setting is a little bleak and the house it is set in is unattractive   br    br   not destined to be a great one to remember             only light spoilers in here  br    br   stealing sinatra is a half slapstick comedy about dimwit kidnappers  dimwit victims  and a few other side stories thrown in to eat up some time  br    br   you will see some poor performances all around in this movie  the drama is forced  and the humor makes no sense  whether you  re watching the kidnappers threaten the victim who won  t shut up  or a victim  s father responding to the criminal  s death threat with   care for some tea     none of it is believable  this quite comfortably fits into the   wannabe movie   category  br    br   you will also be listening to a repetitive goofy music track throughout pretty much the entire movie  it  s quite unprofessional  and adds nothing  it  s really just a sad attempt at making an achingly unfunny movie seem somewhat witty  br    br   however  if you  re able to look past all of this and suspend a lot of disbelief  you might be entertained by the adequate storyline  br    br   i voted                  yes  this is one of those movies  so terrible  so insipid  so trite  that you will not be able to stop laughing  i have watched comedies  good comedies  and laughed less than my wife and i laughed at this movie  the other comments give the idea well enough  the characters are so unpleasant you cheer the rats on  the effects are so poorly done you wonder whose elementary school art class was in charge  the acting   oh the acting   talk about tired dialogue and embarrassing pauses  br    br   but the rat  yes  the big rat  why we didn  t get to see the rat until the end rather surprised me  often the   big one   isn  t shown until the end because the budget is limited and good effects chew up so much money  i surmise  however  that in this case the big rat was hidden until the end because the filmmakers were ashamed that the best they had was a guy running around dressed up like a woodchuck with third world dentistry  br    br   the most sublime part of the whole movie is the elevator scene  after figuring out that the rats couldn  t stand loud noise  migraines from the bad acting    the main dude rigs up a fire alarm to send the rats into a frenzy  if you  ve ever wanting to see a pair of rats waltz while blood squirts out of their heads like a geyser  this film is for you  really  you need to rent it and see for yourself  br    br   but not for more than       ok             well where do i begin my story   i went to this movie tonight with a few friends not knowing more than the actors that were in it  and that it was supposed to be a horror movie  br    br   well i figured out within the first    minutes  what a poor decision i had made going out seeing this movie  the plot was crap  and so was the script  the lines were horrible to the point that people in the audience were laughing hysterically  br    br   the cast couldn  t have been more plastic looking  even some of the scenes seemed like they should have been made much quicker   like they dragged on for no particular reason  very poor editing  br    br   all in all this movie was a giant waste of time and money  boo             this is one of my favorites  betty white and leslie neilson sparkle in this romantic comedy  one is a business executive who re evaluates life based on the expectation of her death within a year  the other is a playboy who has tired of gold digging young women and seeks a relationship with a vital  mature woman  if you  ve got silver in your hair and or romance in your heart  microwave the popcorn  curl up with your honey  and prepare yourself for a treat             following directly from where the story left off in part one  the second half which sets about telling the inevitable downfall and much more grim side of the man  s legacy is exactly as such  in direct contrast to the first feature  part two represents a shift from che the pride and glory of a revolutionised country  to che  struggling liberator of a country to which he has no previous ties  the change of setting isn  t just aesthetic  from the autumn and spring greys of the woodlands comes a change of tone and heart to the feature  replacing the optimism of the predecessor with a cynical  battered and bruised reality aligned to an all new struggle  yet  as che would go on to say himself  such a struggle is best told exactly as that  a struggle  while part one certainly helped document that initial surge to power that the revolutionary guerrilla acquired through just that  part two takes a much more refined  callous and bleak segment of che  s life and ambition  and gives it an assertive portrayal that is both poignant and tragic in a tangible  easy to grasp manner  br    br   while the movie  s tone in some regards does stray off and differ quite drastically from part one however  there still remains that same documented approach taken a month ago that avoids melodrama and fabrication as much as possible  this somewhat distant  cold approach to telling che  s story and struggle will no doubt turn some viewers off  indeed  i still remain reserved about whether or not the feature itself should have been named after one man  if anything  the entirety of che  taken as a whole  delivers a tale that goes beyond mere biography and instead documents a man  s struggle alongside those who helped carry him along the way  by no means does soderbergh try to paint a humanistic portrait here akin to what hirschbiegel did with der untergang half a decade ago  excuse the ironic contrast   che is a slow moving  reserved and meditative approach to telling a history lesson that just happens to be narrated by the one man who   arguably  conducted the whole thing  br    br   yet by moving from the lush green landscapes of cuba and retreating to the bleak  decaying backdrop of bolivia for part two  the story does inevitably take on a distinctly contrasting tone that doesn  t feel too disjointed from its predecessor  but does enough to give it its own reference points  here  the basic structure of part one is echoed back  there  s the initial struggle  the battles  the fallen comrades and the recruiting of those to replace them  all the while we see some glimpses of the man behind the movement  yet  as anyone with the vaguest idea of the actual history behind the feature will know  part two is destined to end on a much more underwhelming  and disquieting note  this difference  in combination with the similarities to part one  make a compelling and memorable whole  by all means  both could be digested one their own  and kudos to soderbergh for achieving as such  and enjoyed as they are  but taken as one statement  che delivers exactly what it sets out to achieve  br    br   indeed  everything that made part one the treat that it was one month prior is still evident here from the subtle yet engrossing performances from the central cast to the slow building  realistically structured combat scenes  the drama inherent to the characters on screen is just as vague and indiscernible  but with a feature such as this  part two once again proves that avoiding such elements don  t necessarily hurt a film when there is enough plot and reflection on other elements to keep the viewer engaged  in fact  upon writing this review i was at odds as to whether or not to simply add a paragraph or two to my initial review for part one  and title the review as a whole  yet i felt that to do so would only serve to disillusion those who may sit down to watch the entirety of both films consecutively  br    br   with that said  i cannot rightfully decree whether or not che holds up to the task of engaging an audience for its sprawling four hour plus runtime  but upon viewing both segments i can at least attest to each part  s ability to do just that  with a reflective  intricate screenplay combined with endlessly mesmerising photography and nuanced performances that do justice to the movie  s characters without drawing attention to themselves  che part two is every bit as compelling and rewarding as its predecessor  but this time with a tragic but uplifting  reaffirming conclusion fit for the history pages of film  br    br     a review by jamie robert ward  http   www invocus net             sometimes it  s hard to be a pirate               but by golly miss jean peters has a lot of fun trying   and it shows particularly during her first spot of friendly swordplay with blackbeard  mr thomas gomez   eminently hissable when the sheer joy of performing is plain on her face  with fifty years of hindsight feminists seem intent on grabbing this movie as some sort of an anthem for the empowerment of women in a male   dominated society but i have serious doubts that either m tourneur or miss peters had any such concept in their heads at the time  it was an exciting entertaining family film with absolutely no pretensions hidden meanings or alternative agenda it was fun  m louis jourdan is both winsome and treacherous as her love interest  mr herbert chapman is wise and philosophical as the wise and philosophical doctor mr james robertson justice is just a tad unbelievable as the bosun  but it is miss peters who stays in the memory wilfully adolescent illiterate tough but vulnerable wonderfully agile and ultimately courageous she is everybody  s idea of a lady pirate  there was a definite window of opportunity for her in feisty costume roles   that she did not choose to seize it is a matter of some regret             i had never seen a film by john cassavetes up until two years ago  when i first saw the killing of a chinese bookie in a berlin cinema  which i found interesting  to put it diplomatically  but not so special  i instantly wanted to see more of his work  since then  i tried   with an emphasis on tried   watching his other work  shadows in particular  i must admit  it took me a a while before i actually enjoyed the film  at first the unpolished  raw and improvised way cassavetes it was shot  put me off somewhat and i thought of it as an original   absolutely   but flawed and dated experiment  but now  upon reviewing  these little imperfections make it look so fresh  even today  br    br   shot on a minimal budget of         with a skeleton six person crew  shadows offers an observation of the tensions and lives of three siblings in an african american family in which two of the three siblings  ben  ben carruthers  and lelia  lelia goldoni   are light skinned and able to pass for white  cassavetes demanded that the actors retain their real names to reflect the actual conflicts within the group but saw the film as being concerned with human problems as opposed imply to racial ones  cassavetes shot the film in ten minute takes and jagged editing  a reaction against   seamless   hollywood production values  cassavetes main inspiration   at least in the cinematic style the film was shot   were the italian neo realists whilst also professing admiration for welles   pioneering spirit  the use of amateurs and improvisation might resemble some of the italian neo realist directors  but with his bebop score by charles mingus ans shafi hadi  the film feels very different  very american  unlike anything made before really   br    br   the song with the feathered girls    i feel like a lolly pop    or something  feels like light years back to me  ancient history  but no matter how dated it might look  it still makes a delightful time capsule of late fifties new york today  i think it  s this is one of the first films made aspiring filmmakers realize they could shoot an independent film  without hollywood  improvised and without a real budget  seymour cassel  who acted and was involved in shadows  claims it was jules dassin  s the naked city        that was the first and inspired them all  but i think this was the one that really opened the eyes of aspiring independent american filmmakers  br    br   camera obscura                     based on an actual story  john boorman shows the struggle of an american doctor  whose husband and son were murdered and she was continually plagued with her loss  a holiday to burma with her sister seemed like a good idea to get away from it all  but when her passport was stolen in rangoon  she could not leave the country with her sister  and was forced to stay back until she could get i d  papers from the american embassy  to fill in a day before she could fly out  she took a trip into the countryside with a tour guide    i tried finding something in those stone statues  but nothing stirred in me  i was stone myself     br    br   suddenly all hell broke loose and she was caught in a political revolt  just when it looked like she had escaped and safely boarded a train  she saw her tour guide get beaten and shot  in a split second she decided to jump from the moving train and try to rescue him  with no thought of herself  continually her life was in danger   br    br   here is a woman who demonstrated spontaneous  selfless charity  risking her life to save another  patricia arquette is beautiful  and not just to look at  she has a beautiful heart  this is an unforgettable story   br    br     we are taught that suffering is the one promise that life always keeps               this pm entertainment production is laced with enough bullets to make john woo say    enough already    of course  it isn  t nearly as beautiful as woo can deliver but it gets the exploitive job done in    minutes  eric phillips  don wilson  is an undercover cop in the near future  when his wife is framed for murdering the governor by a team using a look a like cyborg  it is up to eric to clear her name  wilson gets to pull van damme duty as he plays the heroic lead and his evil cyborg doppelganger  why the academy failed to take notice is beyond me  being a pm production  there are tons of car chases  exploding cars    in the first   minutes   and shoot outs  i particularly liked the van that flips in midair before it even comes close to touching an exploding truck  my other favorite bit involved a neighborhood girl coming over to perfect her karate in don  s simulator  it is merely a chance to show off some cheapo lawnmower man effects circa                  shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho   i  m leaning toward rip off   after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better  almost to the point of being original  bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story  but the film already surpasses many in the   yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks   genre because it is actually shot in the south  br    br   a group of college girls head to ft  lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road   note to yankees  stay on the highway when you go to florida   sue ellen  lisa stahl  has to pee so she heads into the woods  when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff  tony march  strangle his mistress  merry rozelle  to death   note to yankees  do not wander off into the woods when in the south  not because you might witness a murder  but you may run across a marijuana plantation   this is the point where the story  not the movie  actually comes close to being good  br    br   while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech  his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do  tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i  ve seen since walton goggins  deputy steve naish  in house of      corpses  br    br   a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention  the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out  sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her  br    br   and in the strangest scene  sheriff dean makes like he  s about to rape patty  carol cadby  and tells her to take off her clothes  dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he  s about to do  the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible  his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ  i feel sorry for this preacher  s flock  jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven             although this film has had a lot of praise  i personally found it boring  there are some nice brasilian sunsets and the characters are believable  but the story of how they interrelate  even if very unusual by our standards  is not interesting enough to sustain a movie this long  the central woman takes up with one man after another in a close knit way and putting the interests of her children first  as the tolerance of the various men is stretched  we see their characters develop  the story unfolds with dignity and aided by excellent acting  it is a rare glimpse into the brasilian hinterland  far from the city  but hardly exciting enough to keep one  s eyes open for             no mention if ann rivers siddons adapted the material for   the house next door   from her     s novel of the same title  or someone else did it  this lifetime like movie was directed by canadian director jeff woolnough  having read the book a long time ago  we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television  you know that when the critical moments precede the commercials  which of course  one can  t find in this version we watched  br    br   the film  s star is lara flynn boyle who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone through  from the new eyebrows to other parts of her body  ms  boyle is hardly recognizable as col kennedy  the character at the center of the mystery  this was not one of the actress better moments in front of the camera  that goes for the rest of the mainly canadian actors that deserved better  br    br   the film has a feeling of a cross between   desperate houswives   with   the stepford wives   and other better known features  combined with a mild dose of creepiness  the best thing about the movie was the house which serves as the setting             meticulously constructed and perfectly played  to the ends of the earth is a simply astonishing voyage out of our reality and into another age  br    br   based

brutal  monotonous round of seasickness  squalor and danger after another and as edmund becomes entangled in the loves  hopes and miseries of his fellow passengers he experiences a delirious whirl of

based will love this    for everyone else  it  s a whole new world to discover             wow  this is really not that good   br    br   i would like to agree with the others in that at least the acting is good    it is  but it is nothing special  br    br   the movie is so precictable and i for one am sick of receiving culture info through movies  br    br                     i have to point out  before you read this review  that in no way  is this a statement against iranian people     if you really want to read something into it  than hopefully you see  that i  m against politicians in general     but if you  re looking to be offended     i can  t help you  br    br   not in iran as this movie is banned there  see imdb trivia for this movie   which is a shame  because the movie is great  would it not be for   grbavica    this movie would have won at the international film festival in berlin  br    br   rightfully so  it was the runner up  or second place if you will   why  because it is a movie about oppression  it  s not even that this is a complete women issue  it is about the government trying to keep the people down  an analogy so clear that the government felt the need to ban the movie  but by banning it nothing is resolved and or can they make this movie disappear   br    br   another reviewer had a great summary line    comedy about a tragedy    that sums it up pretty well             i know little or nothing about astronomy  but nevertheless  i was  at first  a little sceptical about the plot of this movie  it follows three children that were all born during a solar eclipse and so have no emotion  and thus  naturally  become ruthless serial killers  the plot does sound ridiculous at first  but once you realise that a solar eclipse blocks out saturn and  as you know  saturn is the emotion planet  it all falls into place  makes complete sense and it  s then that you know you aren  t simply watching another silly     s slasher with a pea brain plot  thank god for that  seriously  though  bloody birthday is based on a ridiculous premise  but it more than makes up for that with it  s originality  having a bunch of kids going round slaughtering people may not be the most ingenious masterstroke ever seen in cinema  but when given the choice between this and another dull friday the   th clone   i know what i  d choose  br    br   also helping the film out of the hole that some people would think it  s silly plot dug it into is the fact that it  s extremely entertaining  many slashers become formulaic far too quickly and the audience ends up watching simply to see some gore  this film  however  keeps itself going with some great creepy performances from the kids  which harks back to creepy kid classics such as village of the damned   a constant stream of sick humour and a small  but impressive for the type of film  dose of suspense and tension  one thing that i liked a lot about this movie was the vast array of weaponry  there  s nothing worse than a slasher where the killer uses the same weapon over and over again  cough halloween cough   but that  s not the case here as bloody birthday finds room for everything from skipping ropes to bow and arrows  there wasn  t any room for a chainsaw  which is a huge shame  but i suppose not every film can have a chainsaw in it             after many  many years i saw again this beautiful love story  thinking about how would i  half a century after  react to a film which made so many girls cry and sigh at that time  when i was just an male adolescent trying to understand women  s behaviors  in a small city in brazil  br    br   this time  however  what caught my attention in the film was something very different  namely the insistence with which the physician dr  han suyin  jennifer jones  makes clear to the journalist mark elliott  william holden  her special ethically condition as an eurasian  in fact  she is constantly putting emphasis on this point in their relationship  repeating she is willing to assume her love for him and carry it on in a   occidental way    provided that  by doing so  she is not betraying her chinese side  its seems to the spectator that suyin is eagerly making efforts to establish a very subtle conciliation between those two unstable and opposite aspects of her culture  for they will immediately engage in overt conflict in her mind at a minimum failure in her attempts to control them  br    br   therefore  suyin  s attitudes always leave poor elliott    a determined  brave and extremely practical man    anxious and perplexed  without knowing how much importance to give to her words  for him  whose love for her is plain and simple  the situation is totally clear  if we love each other  let us make a couple and begin immediately a life together    not so fast    is what she seems  verbally and non verbally  to answer him all the time  br    br   in fact  suyin  s chinese portion would never allow her such a level of pragmatism  and  as she goes on and on reinforcing this much aimed equilibrium between those two worlds inside herself  she also frequently signals to him that also a very peculiar trait of chinese culture is deeply rooted in her mind  namely the constant   raids   on the real world by invisible beings from an spiritual or non physical world  for suyin is always alerting elliott about how dangerous is life  not because of any objective and concrete threat  as would be the perpetuation of the english colonialism or the eminence of a japanese invasion   but due to the threats of plenty of cruel and harmful gods and other mystical and mythical beings over the poor  fearful and vulnerable human beings  br    br   in fact  it looks like a whole bunch of chinese deities are permanently on the watch to make people  s life totally miserable  because of that  mothers must dress their precious male babies in girls clothes  so that they are not taken away by jealous gods  everyone should always be ready to make loud noises to send the clouds away  in order to avoid their covering the sight of the moon  peasants are advised that they should shout loudly   the rice is bad  the rice is bad    to protect their crops from being stolen by deities  and  in a funeral  it is recommended that the dead  s family be isolated from the other people by curtains  so that the gods don  t take advantage of their sorrow and fragility  br    br   in other words  suyin introduces us to a culture in which the supernatural has a real existence  as if a rather disturbing pantheon of malign and sadistic gods are always on the verge of negatively interfering with the most banal acts in anyone  s daily life  br    br   as the story takes place in hong kong in       it should be clear that china really was  at that time  almost a semi feudal society  while the country from which elliott had come from was not yet dominated by the fierce capitalism that  launched by the usa after the first oil shock in       took charge of the whole world  therefore  at least in one aspect  both sides of suyin  s eurasian personality were still much more innocent than they would be today  br    br   a lot of history came into being since those old days  as to china  the main fact is that  after several phases of a communist regime  the country finally reached  in the last two decades  the condition of a very aggressive economy much more properly described as state capitalism  and  what happened to that old spirituality that so much enthralled suyin in hong kong  in       and with which she used to impress so much an impassioned elliott  under that tree on the hill behind the hospital  it is gone  completely gone  in brief  if that story took place today  elliott would not find it necessary to go to china to propose to suyin in the presence of the third uncle and her entire family  in fact  both men would now be incomparably closer to one another  in their huge pragmatism  talking business as usual             first and foremost i would like to say  that before i watched this film i considered myself an accepting individual  someone that cared about others  appreciated others  found no barely any judgment against other people  and this film has  i think  changed my life or viewpoint dramatically  when i watched it  i didn  t know particularly what it was about  i knew it was about some type of forbidden relationship  but other then that i was clueless  and as i began to see what was taking place between these two wonderfully depicted characters  i was in shock  disbelief  confusion and surprise  the first time i watched it  i was blind  blind to their love  to their intimacy  to their connection  to their pureness as human beings  to their relationship  i watched it a second time  because i finally figured out how hypocritical i was being  saying to myself and others    oh i accept all types of people  and try not to judge them   while still judging this wonderful and amazingly insightful story  because of my fear i suppose  the second time i watched this film  i opened those eyes of mine that had stayed closed the first time  and really looked  not at the type of taboo relationship part that i  d heard about all my life  but simply at two human beings in love  and i loved it  i loved the storyline  i loved the slightly broken yet strong individual people in the film  i loved the sharing of feelings  and i loved the strong bonds created  it is a really eye opening  beautifully done film that made me cry at times  and i hope that people who read this and are going to watch the film eventually  remember that everyone deserves love  no matter what shape or form it is presented in                  zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz    if imdb would allow one word reviews  that  s what mine would be  this film was originally intended only for kids and it would seem to be very tough going for adults or older kids to watch the film  the singing  the story  everything is dull and washed out  just like this public domain print  like other comedy team films with roots in traditional kids stories  such as the awful snow white and the three stooges and the overrated babes in toyland   this movie has limited appeal and just doesn  t age well  now that i think about it  i seriously doubt that many kids nowadays would even find this film enjoyable  so my advice is don  t watch this film  if you must watch an abbott and costello film  almost any other one of their films  except for a c go to mars  would be an improvement             once in a while  a movie will sweep along that stuns you  draws you in  awes you  and  in the end  leaves you with a renewed belief in the human race from the artistry form  this is not it  this is an action movie that lacks convincing action  it stinks  rent something else             hard to imagine this film is based on a true story  and how christy managed to accomplish the miracle is so heart stirring  daniel day lewis is a chameleon  really hard to imagine how much effort he had done to create this disabled character  watching him on screen is a shocking and breathtaking experience  br    br   the movie is not so pessimistic as i thought before  the story is kinda bright and intriguing  christy is not despised by the normals  his life is also colorful and delightful  although we can be aware of the loneliness and the painful fetter through his eyes  br    br   one important factor of christy  s success is his mother  s support which seems to be more touching  and the unknown actress brenda fricker also deserves her oscar award for this role  this fat little middle aged woman uses her all to make christy  s dream come true  so lucky for christy and hugh o  conor is also excellent as young christy  what a performance for a child  the love story of christy is very well done  trustful  christy wants love and nothing can derive him of the right to love  his crush on the beautiful dr  eileen cole  surprisingly played by fiona shaw  i am deeply impressed with her role in harry potter series  the loathsome aunt petunia  so her appearance in this role is really beyond my mind  but anyway  any woman has her own youth     is paranoiac and offensive  i do have sympathy for him  love is a two edged sword  happiness and agony are just next to each other  br    br   btw  jim sheridan  s works are all good  in america  the boxer etc   except get rich or die trying    god knows why he chose to direct that crap  really a career taint for him  what a pity             i  m stunned that the reviewers   imdb gave this tv film as a high a rating as they did  it  s an innocuous  sweet  uncomplicated clich     of a film that had two big names from the past in it  both of whom did a decent job   but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels  i like a good romance as well as anyone  but as my wife and i were watching this  and before we saw the rating we said    there are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there  s nothing in it to challenge their brains  their faith  their comfort level or their cultural preferences  it  s possible to make a good film like that  and away from her is an example   but this was amateur hour  there are some quite good films rated much lower than this one  truly  another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films  watch the family stone  it  s miles ahead of this schlock             do a title search on randolph scott and trail street is the one film missing from the list you  ve seen  one of   films scott made at rko during his prime        the others are always easy to get  liberal  kansas is just southwest of dodge city and is a powder keg about to explode between the trail riders who drive the longhorns into trail street  the town  s main street  and the sod busters who feed our bellies  it  ll take a strong man like bat masterson to step between the two groups and bring the town to order  more i won  t say  except that scott movies usually have just one pretty girl and this one has three  randolph scott always played men you could look up to for their sense of honor  courage  level headedness and willingness to do the right thing  fifty years ago parents could send their kids to a scott movie with confidence they  d learn positive values  robert ryan co stars in this film  playing a good guy for a change  in real life  ryan was one of the many world war ii heros who starred in america  s movies  how sad what we get these days  george clooney teaches our young that we ought sympathize with suicide bombers  while steven spielberg teaches there is no moral difference between the olympic athletes murdered in      in munich and the palestinian terrorists who killed them  hollywood      derives their moral compass from too much cocaine and too much commitment to the wacky left  i wonder how all this plays out in liberal  kansas  liberal  after all  was not a dirty word     years ago when the city was named             i went to see this one with much expectation  quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest  even a child can see the missing logic to character  s behaviors  today  s kids need creative stories which would inspire them  which would make them   daydream   about the events  that  s precisely what happened with movies like e t  and star wars a decade ago   how many kids imagined about becoming jedi knights and igniting their own lightsabers   seriously don  t waste your time   money on this one              sigh  leave it to us finns to take a stupid idea  blow it out of proportion and try to market it as cool  lordi is a mediocre band at best  and a single gimmick will get you only so far  br    br   to all you marketing idiots out there  this is the reason for the inherent minority complex that is often encountered when finland tries to export something  br    br   lordi isn  t scary  lordi is lame  lordi is over  br    br   i want to apologize to the rest of the world for this plastic faced idiocy  sure  they won the eurovision  br    br   no  wait   they won the eurovision  that  s it  i rest my case            after the highs of darkplace it was never conceivable that holness and adobye would be able to create anything half as good as garth marengi  yet i think that man to man in its own right is as good a show  on the good episodes  as darkplace  i cant argue that   of the episodes really are nt that good but the other   certainly make up for it  if i had to pick   great episodes id go for formula  driver steve pising  pronounced pissing  and the great garth marengi  to already have a bit of understanding of the programme is a real plus as dean learner makes many inside jokes but even if you have nt seen much dean id recommend this as some of the rants he launches into are genius ie  his argument with def lepord over their name  all in all a great show which just misses full marks because of the couple of less funny episodes           i saw this movie in a theater while on vacation in pablo co  i had just quit my biomedical engineering job at a hospital  i consider the script to be a exaggeration of the real type of stuff that goes on in hospitals   br    br   the idiots that put it down on production value don t get the point and probably have never been hospitalized  and never worked in one for sure  billy jack  same era  was very poorly produced but had a significant social comment and was a very good movie with a real social message  br    br   i have ever since been looking for this movie this is the first site i have found where it get mentioned            i caught this on television one day when i was young and loved it  in the       s  there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise  it  s one of the best comedies of the       s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to murrary  s excellent comedic performance  which still stands as one of his greatest  this is the film that really got ivan reitman noticed as a director  reitman proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time  while this film is hilarious and meatballs   is so bad that it  s fun  meatballs   and meatballs   are absolutely dreadful  recommended for those who enjoyed stripes and ghostbusters             the film  s design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country  u s    we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film  befittingly  the obvious of student v s  teacher is present  but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships  male v s  female  white v s  black  and the individual v s  society  but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v s  himself   br    br   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus  most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other  this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides  it did not attempt to show how either was right  although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive  quite obvious towards the end   the film also discusses sex and rape  it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together  for a time  lawrence fishburne does an over the top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps  he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down trodden with the industrious and positive  other stars that make this film are omar epps  ice cube  and jennifer connelly  michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance  tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act  br    br   higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper  in fact  i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other  rather than some dry book  as the real education at a university  it is a life learning process  not a textual one  i think you  ll find   higher learning   is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general                  is rich  ailing elizabeth taylor courting the angel of death on her island fortress in the mediterranean  or is she just overreacting  or more precisely  overacting  as usual  actually  both are applicable in director joseph losey  s wandering  meandering mess called   boom    appropriately titled since tempers in the lush  luxurious setting are nearly ready to explode  richard burton climbs taylor  s mountain uninvited  she dresses him in a samurai  s robe complete with saber  though great looking in widescreen  the picture is otherwise quite deadly  a failure even liz   n dick philes should shun  the stars   collective   what the hell    attitude to their late     s film careers reached an ego mad nadir here   pointless  confused  and maddening    boom   is a catastrophe  although screenwriter tennessee williams  who adapted his own unsuccessful play   the milk train doesn  t stop here anymore    was said to be quite fond of it    from                 i can  t even describe it  it  s the worst movie i  ve ever seen  i  m being a nice guy when i call it movie  just another big budget made to someone who doesn  t like to think much it  s not even scary  it  s revolting when there are great movies that never reach the big screen and then comes this     thing   to trick movie fans  i guess big producers make whatever they want  br    br   just get a big producer  hot chicks  allthough horrible actresses  and a ton of horror movie clich  s and cook it for a week or so  and you  ll get   the nun    br    br   and i thought bad boys   was horrible                the screenplay is the worst part of this film  as it lurches from one premise to the next  missing all the important bits that would have made a number of different stories possible   this film is confusing  because the audience doesn  t know what the story is   i had no problem with the low production values and the acting wasn  t great  but this is telly  so it was fine  i don  t mind if some scenes looked like they were done in one take  but having such a non sensical screenplay is completely unnecessary  did any executive actually read it before forking out the cash  avoid this at all costs  br    br   the prologue in particular was so poorly written  it needed a voice over to fill in all the details that had been left out  the prologue was rushed  it wasn  t clear what was happening  ie  the russian revolution was reduced to   some riots are happening in petersburg    with the next scene being soldiers arresting them  i know the basic history of the revolution  so i could fill in the details    those pesky communists    the prologue is best ignored  br    br   this could have been a thoughtful study of a person who is confused about who she is  it sets up this premise in the asylum  it could then have her struggling to identify herself for the rest of the film  no  gone  the film assumes she is who she says she is  even though there is still no empirical evidence   it sets up a melodramatic romance  a love so strong  it  ll believe anything she says  okay  a soppy romance  no  because it makes no sense  the love interest seems like a crazed  and incidentally  sleazy  lunatic  bursting out in wild gestures  this also doesn  t work  because the film stupidly decides to tell the truth in the monologue at the end  they never got married and she returned to america  the love story collapses  despite there being plenty of love scenes  i was never convinced of the reason that they were in love  i find rom com romances more convincing  despite there only being one or two scenes which establish that they  ve even spent any time with each other  br    br   it could have been a thriller type thing where the film assumes she is who she says she is  and she struggles to prove her identity  no  the court case is summed up rather than dealt with  the bizarre voice over comes back  again to fill in the details of a better film  br    br   the funniest thing to consider is what really happened  anna anderson was a loony who went to america and married another loony and they did crazy things together  throughout her life  she had bouts of lunatic behaviour  none of this in the film either  there  s a really annoying character in the asylum who crops up from nowhere and announces herself as a   one flew over the cuckoo  s next   twelve monkeys   type informant  thankfully  she vanishes  having brought nothing to the story             lady and the tramp ii  scamp  s adventure i think is a good movie but i think the first lady and the tramp movie is better because it is the original and i would think that the original movies compared to the sequeals is better  lady and the tramp ii takes off after the original  but this time it  s junior  s turn  lady and tramp  s youngster  scamp  always hates been treated with the things that has to be done with him  following the rules in the house  taking baths all the time and taking things nice and easy  scamp gets angry and runs away with a pack of dogs that are left off the loose  scamp meets another dog called angel  they both get along fine and do the things scamp  s mother and father did  having an italian meal  spagetthi and meatballs etc  afterwards  scamp realises that he is loved by his family especial his pal  which is the baby  scamp comes back and angel is joined in the family  i give this movie    out of                wow  what  s this on the video rental store  s shelf in front of me  nothing other than a questionable   sequel   to  mm  it wasn  t a very good sequel to a movie that had a very definitive end and an abundance of emotional depth far greater than this movie  br    br   basically  from the plot outline verbatim  an american diplomat  david huxley  and his fianc  e  tish harrington  venture into the sordid underworld of sex and pornography in budapest  hungary to find out who is blackmailing them with a porno video taken of them with a prostitute  risa  the entire story is based around the various characters who make up these various sex clubs and strip joints throughout the city  the mystery is solved when  in the end  tish finds out that the ransom money for the video and  essentially later on in the story  her fianc  e which came out of her trust fund money is basically going back to her future husband as the story unfolds til the bitter end  br    br   i didn  t like how this had nothing to do with the original  mm at all  the only thing close to the original is the type of thriller that it was  the fact that david ends up with some kind of bondage contraption over him to keep him prisoner looks like the kinky world of the first film  and the fact that the entire movie has sex emblazoned throughout almost every key scene  otherwise  its a totally different movie  it made for a lousy love story  even before the end is known  which makes the ending more of a possibility because i didn  t believe the words coming out of david  s mouth the whole time  but we were warned that he was a liar about most things that might get him in trouble  br    br   there were ridiculous nude scenes in most of the   shocking   moments of the film  which were trying to stir emotions in the audience to cheer for tish to figure out the plot so she can leave this   hellish   sex debauchery  i counted at least    ridiculously filmed sequences when there was nothing but sex to be shown  even the menu screen on the dvd is nothing but film with naked women on it to make the dvd seem totally provocative  br    br   david was no heroic person throughout the film  you could guess he was the main problem long before the end  the actors who played each role were all new to me  which might explain how they got so many of them to strip down to gain acting   respect    there were plot holes  how did david and richard finally impress tish  s father by getting the lease they wanted when david was so wrapped up in this damn investigation to try and find a prostitute   there were cheesy technology moments  like the talking email program dressed up like a bondage queen   and a gay brother character which did nothing but show how the director was trying to get a joaquin phoenix knockoff to play this character  the tag line featured on this profile for this video is complete bs  too  because it wasn  t even about a last breath  nobody really dies  but they did have a good car crash sequence that came out of nowhere   but that was a good    seconds long out of an hour and     long movie  br    br   go rent  and maybe buy  the original  it  s one of joel schumacher  s better and more original films  it has everything better about it from this film  i wouldn  t recommend seeing this unless you want to compare apples to oranges             ok  honestly i dont see why everybody thinks this is so great  its really not  there were two good things that came out of this movie    jack  s performance  he was very good i can tip my hat for him     danny  s performance  he was good  no other then that it got pretty stupid  and  what was stanley kubrick thinking drafting shelly as the wendy  she was so bad  she looked the same every time she got scared  the problem with this movie was the ending  i would have had more respect for it if kubrick would have ended it differently  and  the over all movie was just stupid  the problem with the movie is that the book was so much better  so dont see the movie read the book and you will be much better off                   this episode had potential  the basic premise of a woman living next door to an empty apartment  but a phone that constantly rings  is somewhat interesting  and when she explores the noise  there is genuine tension and fear  but stupid script writing ruins any promise the episode had  br    br   first of all  the woman readily admits to seeing things that would send most of us running in the other direction  e g    it  s funny that the door slammed shut even though there is no wind      this door has serious damage to it that wasn  t here a minute ago      the door opened by itself  without me touching it    etc    given these supernatural phenomena  plus the fact that a woman committed suicide in the room  wouldn  t she take some precaution before entering it  maybe she could investigate in the day time  or maybe she could investigate the apartment with somebody else  or maybe she could turn on the lights    also  while in the haunted apartment  she decides to make numerous phone calls to the operator and gets into an argument over who has the power to disconnect the phone  and then they begin discussing the details of the suicide  just unplug the phone  the phone company doesn  t need to be involved  walk up to the phone and unplug it  case closed  br    br   finally  showing the phone scamper across the floor like it  s alive was just comical  if the director wanted the woman to get strangled by the phone card  he could  ve done it in a way that didn  t look

movie at all  it  s a waste of money and time             i first remember bumping into this zaniness from the zucker brothers and jim abrahams  back in the early days at comedy central  back in those days  the     s  their programming consisted of benny hill reruns and the original mst k  complete with bearded host  br    br   capt  frank drebin  played by the stone faced  dead pan filibuster  leslie nielson  is a process created first from the amalgamation of various stereotypical police television show protagonists  think dragnet meets starsky   hutch the show   boiled in a flask full of well known police television show plots and scenarios  this is distilled    times to produce the most pure policeman every made  forget about simon pegg in hot fuzz  for now  save it for later   frank drebin is clueless at most times  a terrible driver  a terrible shot  macho yet sensitive and vulnerable  he is a master of the police investigative methodology  a k a   ask johnny the leathery old shoe shine boy   this does not make him a bad cop  cops get lucky also  capt drebin  notice he  s a captain here  has perfected it  along with his partner  nordberg  and the rest of force  perfectly parody the police drama over the course of   golden episodes  br    br   the show is a treasure trove of hilarious dialog and quotable quote ables  most of the sight gags are a bit dated and silly  the magic never came from the sight gags however  at its core was a nonsensical and straight faced conversation and activities in the foreground  with crazy things occurring in the background  the movies can best be described as    minute compilations of the best gags from this series  think of monty python  s and now for something completely different      br    br   if you liked airplane        naked gun        or top secret  then you will definitely enjoy this   br    br   i always liked the series better than the movies  even though i saw the movies first  why    words   no o j             a guy desperate for action attempts to hit on a gorgeous girl in a bus  she refuses him  but when he runs after someone who tries to steal her purse they get together anyway  and there it starts   a relation that is slightly tainted by the fact that she is a jealous and neurotic superhero  it can  t be a secret that things between them are going to be problematic  br    br   in short  a story that could promise to grow out into a cool film  and imo  it succeeds at being a nice film  it  s no masterpiece  but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion   the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is  even with the superhero thing going  believable  br    br   so  thin story  but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time  br    br     out of    broken hearts           i think it is great one of my favourite films as a kid and who said there songs were unforgettable they were mint i can still remember them now word for word the film remains a favourite with my family and my younger cousins are now addicted to it too they even know the songs this film is great and a enjoyable film for kids it has a moral lesson so don t say its not good because it shows how lying gets you nowhere ill leave with a parting comment  this film is amazing love me xxx p s i would like the soundtrack but i cant and yes the animation is good the jokes are humorous and the action never stops this film will go down in children s film history and in my opinion one of the only remaining safe films to show children            the film someone had to make  br    br   waco  the rules of engagement dissects the evidence behind the standoff in waco  texas that led to the destruction of the branch davidian homestead and the alleged government cover up  br    br   the first thing you need to know about this film  you will see brief but disturbing photos of the victims bodies  this is not done for shock value  but to illustrate points about the way they died  as if you were present at the coroner  s inquest  br    br   the second thing you should know about this film  at two and a quarter hours  it  s pretty ponderous   especially if you already followed the events closely at the time  if you are unaware of any of the events other than what was reported in the mass media  or if the only side of the story you are familiar with is the official government report  this may be essential viewing  if  on the other hand you want a more concise  albeit unapologetically one sided  version of events  you should see   waco  the big lie    br    br   in summary  this is pretty much the definitive documentary about this tragic event  and is very sobering  but as a work of film making  could test your patience  especially if you have a short attention span  and it  s at times superfluous for those who watched the cspan hearings and the    minutes reports  br    br   perhaps someday someone will make a documentary that covers some of the stranger aspects of this story  such as the bizarre chain of events that led up to the atf raid or the psychological warfare tactics the fbi used blasting rock music at the sect  and their charismatic leaders  all rock musicians themselves  picking up their instruments and turning their massive amplifiers outward to blast their own music right back at them             what a good movie  at last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock  illusions of fame  well known rockers are getting old and forgotten  not the music  and with a good sense of humour  have you ever danced on bill haley  s rock around the clock  br    br   anyway  still crazy is probably the best movie about rock n  roll i have ever seen  far much better than spinal tap for instance  why  because in still crazy  people are mature  they have a different point of view about rock  about love and about life  they want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much  beyond the story itself  we see characters with their own personality  weaknesses and dreams  like anyone of us  br    br   spend a good time watching this  listen to the awesome soundtrack   and finally thinking of your own future  br    br   bye             had it with the one who raised you since when you were young  you just want her gone from your life  that woman is your mother  you should respect her  you should honor her  whether she  s in sick or well  but that in times  it can be aggravating  especially when she becomes very overbearing  that  s how owen danny devito  had to deal with in   throw momma fron the train    his momma anne ramsey            is one of the worst  he trying his best to be a writer  and she is everything but grateful  calls him a   clumsy poop    a   larda      and   fat   and   stupid    for his friend  larry donner billy crystal  he has his own woman problems  his ex wife  she trying to discredit him  so what did owen do  push her overboard  what does he do  help return the favor  get rid of mrs  lift  in the kitchen scene  i liked it where owen called larry    cousin patty    and momma said    you don  t have a cousin patty    and owen shouts   you lied to me    and el cabongs larry with the frying pan  then comes the fun part when they where on the train and try to kill momma lift  that is thwarted  and she kicks larry off the train  well  everything back to normal  the ex wife lives  but momma kicked the bucket on her own  maybe she should have seen the errors of her domineering ways  a fun movie it is  and the cast is great  a classic    stars             yes  it is a bit cheesy  but it  s suspenseful and entertaining  and one of my favorites  there are some excellent actors in the film  and they do a commendable job given the limitations of plot and characters  it  s interesting to see david soul in a   bad guy   role  i thought he was quite believable  and rather chilling  as the ever more paranoid co  robert conrad is a long time favorite  i think he brings his character to life very well  and sam waterston has been star quality in everything of his i  ve watched  movies or tv   br    br   i watch this movie every so often but our tape  a vhs tv copy i got  is such poor quality it  s difficult to fully enjoy it  this is a movie i think they should put out on dvd  maybe it wouldn  t be universally sought after  but i  m sure there are lots of people like me out there who like this sort of film so there would be a market for a dvd version  i  ll keep hoping             so it isn  t an epic  but for people experiencing anything similar br    br    sibling suicide  it might be an interesting way of therapy  an br    br   imaginative narrative and some fine acting makes it time well br    br   spent  for some reason  it hasn  t really caught on in the audience  br    br   something i do believe is a result of the main theme  why did she br    br   commit suicide  clearly  this is hardly something that us br    br   moviegoers will flock to  had it been an european production it br    br   probably would have reached its audience in a much greater br    br   extent  it is however  a movie that although the realism tainted by a br    br   shimmering romanticized glow  gives the viewer a whole hearted br    br   impression             i absolutely loved this film  i was hesitant to watch it at first because i thought it would be too painful  i remember how hard it was when john was shot  however  watching the   two of us   took me back to a happier time when he was still alive and there was hope and possibility  i think that the writer did an amazing job depicting what   might have been    aidan quinn was adorable as paul and met the challenge head on  i was impressed with his accent and mannerisms  jared harris is also very talented and was quite believable as john  my favorite parts were the scene in the park and the rooftop scene   which was so poignant  the film left me with both sadness and satisfaction  both of which i feel are appropriate  given the circumstances             previous reviewer claudio carvalho gave a much better recap of the film  s plot details than i could  what i recall mostly is that it was just so beautiful  in every sense   emotionally  visually  editorially   just gorgeous  br    br   if you like movies that are wonderful to look at  and also have emotional content to which that beauty is relevant  i think you will be glad to have seen this extraordinary and unusual work of art  br    br   on a scale of   to     i  d give it about an       the only reason i shy away from   is that it is a mood piece  if you are in the mood for a really artistic  very romantic film  then it  s a     i definitely think it  s a must see  but none of us can be in that mood all the time  so  overall                   great premise  poor execution  cast of great actors is watered down into a poorly written  poorly directed  poorly edited  waste of film  only redeeming quality is the numerous shots of the food  br    br   joan chen  mercedes ruehl  kyra sedgwick  and alfre woodard should fire their agents             have to agree that this movie and it  s talented director do not receive the plaudits they deserve  here  s hoping that the dvd will do very well and bring both to the attention of a wider audience  the actors gave excellent performances and the plot is excellent  perhaps overall the movie is a little long but may miles thomas seems to enjoy her actors when they are giving strong performances and therefore sometimes holds them in longer close ups than necessary  good for the actors i am sure but sometimes as the audience you are ready to move on so to speak with the plot  may miles thomas deserves more recognition from the film business as one of our foremost digital movie directors             i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday  first of all  i wanted to see gina lollobrigida   and here i wasn  t disappointed  she looked gorgeous  second of all  through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca  s films  on this account  however  i was sadly disappointed  i found the jokes predictable  apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war  and the characters completely one dimensional  also  the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion  with no sense of drama at all  i kept watching until the end  but i got bored very quickly and just sat there  waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida             this film is an abomination of all that is worthy in film making  the lead actor surprises his audience by not actually acting at all  we have to watch almost two hours of his bland soulless face  the jokes are all lame i never laughed once it was saturday night there were   of us having a beer all up for a laugh and then we put this on and you could feel all the warmth and colour being drained from the room  the film ended and the mood was ruined so we all went our separate ways  ruined the night   ok so pros and cons  pros beautiful setting in hawaii  looks good on bluray  cons worst acting ever  you can tell everyone concerned is just thinking about payday  predictable poor plot  zero character development  forced jokes which fall flat  many shots of the guys penis which to be fair acts better than him and has more charisma  may all makers of this film hang their heads in shame and hold their flaccid manhoods cheap             this was my first gaspar noe movie i  ve watched and i have to say i was shocked  i don  t mind gore in generally  but this isn  t even gore   it  s real butchering  for some of you a couple of scenes may be impossible to see and i mean really disgusting  leaving aside these aspects  the main ideas revealed here and the dialog are quite brilliant  when you are given a strong argument against bringing a new life into the world and the manner in which it is given  you can  t stop and take a minute to think about it  the actors did their job well  representing general masks of a handpick few people found at the bottom of a diseased society  the movie is full of metaphors  but i  ll let you figure them out  don  t watch it if you want to have a lite  relaxing time  i recommend this movie to all those of you who want something to think about or simply watch something different of what you find in your average cinema             i agree with bigalc   this movie actually prepared me for a lot of the cultural differences and practices before i went to live in japan for a year in       tom selleck does a fantastic job here  as always  and the movie is greatly humorous and educational  i  m a big fan of tom selleck  s  and he blesses this part with his usual charm and charisma to this part  bringing the film to life in a way i can  t imagine any other actor being able to pull off   br    br   this film featured some first rate japanese actors  and it was highly entertaining to watch them as they interacted with selleck   i can imagine the fun he had during the actual filming of the movie   japan  s an awesome place to go  whether you want to party  sight see or just try to take everything in             i laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt  ben affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy jack black in this role  gandolfini gives his typical a performance  the entire cast is funny  the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome  i went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why i was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted  i would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy  can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives  the best part to this film  to me anyway  were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped  namely  the scene involving the lighting of the christmas tree  go see it and have a good laugh             although i lived in australia in       i moved overseas not long after  fed up with constant industrial unrest  the general worship of mediocrity   unless one is a sportsman    and the complacency of so many australians who chose to ignore the breakneck pace of change taking place in countries to their north   br    br   consequently i missed the dismissal  along with many other australian made tv dramas of the     s and     s  such as the superb janus and phoenix series  which i have since seen  along with wildside  br    br   to me the filmed story of the dismissal is fair and  as far as i am aware  accurate  however  as to public   outrage   it only shows one side of the picture  not how families were riven by the controversy  i know  as my two brothers would not speak to me for months afterward   br    br   but the commentary is  in my view  very one sided throughout  the inescapable fact is that  notwithstanding fiery expressions of rage from a substantial proportion of the community  the australian electorate chose   and chose decisively   in favour of fraser  as they did again two years later   br    br   this apart  a historically accurate and superbly well acted docudrama             i may be a good old boy from virginia in the confederate states of america  but this man does it for me  that mustache gets me riled up  i remember when i first saw a video of his  that girl he beat was amazing  the depth of his acting when they cut to his weathered facade was a new level of masculinity  it reminds me of the granite sculptures of our mt  rushmore  if i could ask him one question  it would be   if you were a hot dog  would you eat yourself    will orhan be doing a reunion tour  take note from the greats like gordon lightfoot  true music from the heart never fades away  vive la john denver  gracias my friend  o f f l   orhan fan for life             i never want to see this movie again  br    br   not only is it dreadfully bad  but i can  t stand seeing my hero stan laurel looking so old and sick  br    br   mostly i can  t stand watching this terrible movie  br    br   frankly  there is no reason to watch this awful film  the plot is just plain stupid  the actors that surround stan laurel and oliver hardy are really really bad and laurel and hardy have been funnier in any of their earlier films   br    br   i warn you don  t watch it  the images will haunt you for a long while to come             the problem is the role of the characters in the film  man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself  the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film   two people who are kidnapped  treated like animals  and yet given such a shallow  stereotypical role within the film    the kidnapper  british anthropologist  ends up being the hero of the film because he   manages   to relate to the pygmies    no notion of how the two hostages feel  of their point of view  of their ordeal    i find it is a shallow film  with a one sided fundamentally racist view    it never manages to move away from the   white mans   view            life begins   and ends   in a typical       s maternity   recovery ward  where we view    hours in the lives of several high risk pregnant women  played by loretta young  glenda farrell  clara blandick  aunty em      vivienne osborne  dorothy tree  and gloria shea  as they await to give birth  while the film features plot devices which seem far fetched today when maternity wards are much more controlled and restricted  it does offer us a look back in time to see what giving birth in a typical city hospital in      was like for our grandmothers and great grandmothers  i found the film fascinating and exceptionally moving  br    br   oddly enough  the most outstanding performance in this film comes from a male cast member  young eric linden as jed sutton  grace  s  loretta young  husband  what an actor  as a first time father  jed is distraught and uneasy with hospital staff who seem to brush off his concerns about his wife as they might brush crumbs off a cafeteria table  i felt his every concern keenly  i  d like to see more of this actor  s work  he had a very emotional voice  which was used to unforgettable effect in gone with the wind  in that film eric played the young soldier whose leg was amputated without anesthesia  who screamed   don  t cut  don  t cut    as scarlett fled the hospital in horror  chilling  another great performance is from aline macmahon  who plays miss bowers  the nurse  her character is a salt of the earth type  the kind of nurse we all hope to get for our hospital stays  who breaks the hospital rules constantly in order to show a more humane side of the medical profession  br    br   loretta young did another superb acting job here as well  a very authentic and deeply felt performance as grace  my  she is great in these precodes  i  ve really grown to appreciate her more as an actress the last few months  br    br   glenda farrell played her role of a shrill unwed mother a little over the top for my taste  didn  t anyone know back in      that swigging brandy from a hot water bottle might be hazardous to unborn babies   health   but her character redeems herself in the end  br    br   also in the cast was an uncredited gilbert roland  silent movie star  as a grieving italian husband  his screen time was brief  but notable  br    br   life begins is a must see precode  try to catch it sometime on tcm  but remember to bring a few hankies to cry into    out of                this is a great film  touching and strong  the direction is without question breathless  good work to the team  i feel so sorry for marlene  by the grace of god go you or i            i think the manuscript of this movie was written on the piece of toilet paper  no respect whatsoever to many important details which intrinsically make the movie  for example  the names of some serbian terrorists  that i remember  are caradan maldic  ivanic loyvek and leo hasse  what kind of names are that  certainly not serbian  by the way  caradan maldic    what a name  i laughed for days thinking about it  probably an implication on karadzic and mladic  secondly  there have never been any cases of terrorism done by serbians  a journalist like the main character ought to have known that  thirdly  the actors playing serbian terrorists are not even serbs nor do they speak serbo croatian  all this aside  this movie is solidly acted but the story is paper thin and full of holes  at times it makes no sense whatsoever                criticism does mention spoilers  br    br   i rarely make user comments  but this is one movie i have no problem slandering  this movie stinks  and its mediocre of rating of   and a half stars is probably too high for such pulp  the bone collector is not at all the same calibre of film that silence of the lambs or seven were  despite what its ad claims  this is a perfect example of how not to make a thriller  the pace of this movie was extremely slow  i actually left for about    minutes half way through and came back at the exact scene with the exact same character with absolutely no progression  i refer to you the part where angelina jolie  s character debates denzel about cutting off a corpse   hands   the movie is not at all scary  but tries to compensate this with a love subplot albeit sexy angelina jolie  s character and denzel washington  s  of course  what you get is something comparable to that of the mentor student relationship as seen in the brillian epic silence of the lambs with hannibal lecter and starling  however  even this lacks all effectiveness and i was personally routing for the villain to kill denzel off so as to avoid hackneyed giggles between the two  with such a crappy movie  i was half expecting a plot twist or some sort of spectacular situation to occur at the end to give the movie some credit  things that mediocre movies like arlington road and scream pulled off  anybody with a  th grade education can see the ending how will be resolved   a situation which mimicks alfred hitchcock  s rear window   the cliche of having the killer explain his motives was uninspired enough  but the reason was so ridiculous and stupid it had me spewing latte over the screen  esoterically speaking  i even think the murderer  s intention was completely lost as denzel happily recovers from his loss over the proverbial   chess game   and gets with his pet project  angelina  br    br   if you are a fan of movies with original ideas and genuinely dynamic concepts  like i am   you will not appreciate this film  if you have not attended a single movie in your life and would like to catch up on every single hollywood cliche ever borne  the late night knock on the window from somebody else but the murderer  the ridiculous serial killer to prime investigator relationship  the horrible   woman trying to get by in an all male dominated workforce aka sotl    see this movie    but even then its too slow paced and you  d be bored             possible spoilers  perhaps  i must say that   cinderella ii  dreams come true   is one of the worst movies ever made  first of all  the movie was made during the height of disney  s sequel rampage  it was created around the same time as   the little mermaid ii      the jungle book ii    and   peter pan ii    all of which were disservices to their original film classics   disney also made   the hunchback of notre dame ii   and   atlantis ii    but i  m going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place     let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films  and i absolutely adore the original disney   cinderella    the sequel to   cinderella    however  was a waste of time  the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching  in the original  cinderella was kind and loving  the new cinderella had very out of character moments with current era phrasing like    i  m going to do this banquet my way    let me also tell you that new cinderella  as i have affectionately named her  says    ewww    that is the anti cinderella  i try to find the best in people  but in the sequel  anastasia  one of the stepsisters  is good  what the heck  why  they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia  my question to the world  did the people at disney watch the original   cinderella   when making this sequel  well  it surely doesn  t seem so  if i remember correctly  anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine  i am all for redemption and forgiveness  but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie  in the first one  anastasia was evil  in the second one  she is good  one just can  t leave a story like this  i hope disney realizes that this movie  among other movies  is shaming walt disney  s name  perhaps now that michael eisner is gone  things will start shaping up around the house of mouse             hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of      s  this movie  s true score  br    br   as mentioned before chris rock is the king  previous to going to see this movie i wasn  t that over the top about him but now i  m banging on the doors of chris rock  s website begging him to take me on as his protege  this film is truly funny  if you don  t find this movie funny you really need therapy and it  s humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably   class division  love  wealth  employment  dreams  stand up comedy    the list goes on  br    br   there was one slight disappointment for me however  this was that in going into this film i didn  t realise that it was actually a remake of   heaven can wait   another quite good movie made in      with warren beatty  as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago   regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any   you get the picture  br    br   well to the actual plot of the film  br    br   don  t spoil the experience for yourself  don  t read the plot  just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it  go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time  go and see it because it  s a cinema experience that doesn  t leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets  go see it because it is a good movie             formula movie about the illegitimate son of a rich chilenian who stands to inherit a fortune and gets mixed up in the affairs of bad guys and falls in love with a beautiful female lawyer  vargas   it looks very much like a tv movie  not really exciting  the only reason i bothered to see it was because valentina vargas was in it  no real surprises here  though it is nice to see vargas  great looking chilenian landscapes on display but malcolm mcdowell  s part is very small and doesn  t add much to the movie  michael ironside plays as usual a bad guy but this is not one of his most memorable parts  the chase scenes are standard fare             whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome  otherwise  this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor  her downward phase   and richard burton  his miscasting phase   tennessee williams wrote   the milk train doesn  t stop here anymore   and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play  but apparently  he was the only one  taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money  br    br   whatever  it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner  exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears  br    br   it  s so campy that among taylor fans it  s probably considered a   must see   kind of thing  but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand  you  re way ahead of me  sadly  this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress  even after winning two oscars  for burton  it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb  judge for yourself if you dare             viva la bam this   jackass   spin off focuses on the  obviously scripted  adventures of bam margera and his pals  johnny knoxville  brandon dicamillo  etc   this show  while it has its fair share of gross out comedy and crazy stunts  focuses mainly on bam  s torturing of his parents  br    br   i  m sorry to say this  bam  but    you  re in no way as cool as you think you are  this ego tripped show is not only painfully unfunny  and yes  i liked jackass   but also narcissistic beyond belief  the overly stylized intro ends with bam coolly explaining that he  s going to do   whatever the f      he wants to  how about you do something that is actually funny  i liked   jackass   for what it was worth  the camera work was horrible   any idiot could have made a better show with a camcorder in their parents   garage   but at least the show moved at a steady pace and never felt boring between the crazy  dangerous or simply disgusting stunts the pals performed  br    br   not so with   viva la bam    we follow our hero around as he plays pranks on his friends and tortures his relatives  but never does it feel like anything else than really lame and scripted comedy  the stunts and pranks are mildly entertaining  but presented in such a tedious and dull fashion that they can barely make you smile  br    br     viva la bam   is a poor spin off of that does little good but feed margera  s already too big ego  i don  t recommend this lame and unimaginative show to anyone             i had never heard of larry fessenden before but judging by this effort into writing and directing  he should keep his day job as a journeyman actor  like many others on here  i don  t know how to categorize this film  it wasn  t scary or spooky so can  t be called a horror  the plot was so wafer thin it can  t be a drama  there was no suspense so it can  t be a thriller  its just a bad film that you should only see if you were a fan of the blair witch project  people who liked this film used words  like   ambiguity   and complex and subtle but they were reading into something that wasn  t there  like the blair witch  people got scared because people assumed they should be scared and bought into some guff that it was terrifying  this movie actually started off well with the family   meeting   the locals after hitting a deer  it looked like being a modern day deliverance but then for the next    minutes   well over half the film   nothing happened  the family potted about their holiday home which was all very nice and dandy but not the slightest bit entertaining  it was obvious the locals would be involved in some way at some stage but essendon clearly has no idea how to build suspense in a movie  finally  when something does happen  its not even clear how the father was shot  how he dies   the nurse said his liver was only grazed   and all the time this wendigo spirit apparently tracks down the apparent shooter in a very clumsy way with  rd grade special effects  the film is called wendigo but no attempt is made to explain it in any clear way  the film ends all muddled and leaves you very unsatisfied  i would have bailed out with    minutes to go but i wanted to see if this movie could redeem itself  it didn  t             schlocky     s horror films   ya gotta love   em  in contrast to today  s boring slasher flicks  these k tel specials actually do something scary and do not resort to a tired formula  br    br   this is a b movie about the making of a b movie   that went horribly wrong  faith domergue  this island earth  stars as an over the hill  b movie queen making a movie about a series of grisly murders that befell a family in their home  her boyfriend director  who looks and acts like gordon jump with an attitude  is filming on location and on a tight schedule  the ken doll co star discovers a book of tibetian chants that they work into the script to add   realism    unfortunately    realism   is something they could have done without  br    br   john carradine  having long since given up looking for the   th gland  the unearthly   now eeks out a humble existence as the caretaker for the estate  he goes about his daily work  but always seems to run afoul of the director  br    br   the horror builds slowly  a dead cat here  john carradine entering a grave there  finally culminating in seven  yes seven murders   at least there  s truth in advertising   it  s just sad that the ghoul didn  t understand that there was a movie being made above him  how was poor faith to know that those darn tibetian chants would actually work  face it  you just can  t go around tugging on satan  s coat and expect him to take it lying down  br    br   sterno says perform an autopsy on the house of seven corpses             i suppose for      this film was supposed to be    cool      but looking back now      years   it  s charm was just as silly as it  s entertainment value   granted   the special effects do well on t v  with the series that started in        but for the big screen    i once had a fish tank that was equally as exciting   i must agree about the octopus scene near the end where it attached itself to the seaview  obviously not well staged   or trained   overall   it  s pretty bad acting with shoddy special effects and i still do recommend it   for fun laughs sake  this was probably one of irwin allen  s biggest films and i think he thought a lot of it   barabara eden went on to play    genie    on t v  micheal ansara was her husband   now that is a cool part about this film   i always enjoyed seeing real life husband and wife teams star in the same movie   neat              this is one of the finest films to come out of hong kong  s   new wave   that began with tsui hark  s   zu  warriors of magic mountain    tsui set a tone for the new wave  s approach to the martial arts film that pretty much all the directors of the new wave  jackie chan  sammo hung  wong jing  ching siu tung  etc   accepted from then on as a given  namely  the approach to such films thenceforth would need more than a touch of irony  if not outright comedy    burning paradise   put a stop to all that  and with a vengeance  br    br   it  s not that there isn  t humor here  but it is a purely human humor  as with the aged buddhist priest at the beginning who somehow manages a quick feel of the nubile young prostitute while hiding in a bundle of straw  but this is just as humans are  not even buddhist priests can be saints all the time  br    br   when irony is at last introduced into the film  it is the nastiest possible  emanating from the   abbot   of red lotus temple  who is a study in pure nihilism such as has never been recorded on film before  he is the very incarnation of milton  s satan from   paradise lost      better to rule in hell than serve in heaven    and if he can  t get to satan  s hell soon enough  he  ll turn the world around him into a living hell he can rule  br    br   that  s the motif underscoring the brutal violence of much of the imagery here  it  s not that the abbot just wants to kill people  he wants them to despair  to feel utterly hopeless  to accept his nihilism as all encompassing reality  thus there  s a definite sense pervading the red temple scenes that there just might not be any other reality outside of the temple itself   it has become all there is to the universe  and the abbot  claiming mastery of infinite power  is in charge  br    br   of course  fortunately  the film doesn  t end there  though there are losses  the human will to be just ordinarily human at last prevails   if you want to know how  see the film   yet there is no doubt that  in viewing this film  we visit hell  hopefully  we do not witness our own afterlives  but we certainly feel chastened by the experience   and somehow better for it over all             now i don  t hate cheap movies  i just don  t see why you should waste any money for a movie you could shoot with your dad  s camcorder  if i rent a movie  i want it to be a movie  not a bunch of people thinking it would be a good idea to waste some minidv   tapes  br    br   maybe i hate this one so much because the guy in the video store said it was great  and it wasn  t  maybe i hate it because it  s cheap  has the dumbest plot ever  the most unrealistic characters ever and the really  really  really worst showdown in the history of films ever  even tom savini can  t save this  br    br   seriously  this one is a complete waste of time             a fabulous book about a fox and his family who does what foxs do  that being stealing from farms and killing prey  until a trio of farmers decide they  ve had enough of this fox and try in various ways to have the problem   solved    they are of course   out foxed   at every turn and while the trio are camped out at the fox hole the family perform raids against the three farmers land  br    br   the  film   version  and i use the term film very loosely  is more of a god awful pastiche of american heist movies particularly the oceans movies  they they even have george clooney as mr fox to to add to the insult and manage to miss the point of the story quite completely  so kudos to them  they  ll make lots of money and destroy another classic roald dahl children book             as soon as it hits a screen  it destroys all intelligent life forms around   but on behalf of its producers i must say it doesn  t fall into any known movie category  it deserves a brand new denomination of its own   it  s a   neurological drama     it saddens and depresses every single neuron inside a person  s brain  br    br   it  s the closest thing one will ever get to a stroke without actually suffering one  it drives you speechless  all you members go numb  your mouth falls open and remains so  and the most strange symptom of all is that you get yourself wishing to go blind and deaf  br    br   no small feat for such a sort of a   movie    br    br   the only word that comes to my mind just having finished my ordeal is outrage                   for a film made in senegal  based  i guess loosely on carmen  the book  by prosper merimee  this film doesn  t achieve a mere resemblance of the story that has been made famous as an opera and as other films  br    br   ms  gai as the karmen of the title is very good to look at  her fiery dancing smolders the screen  as is the case with her torrid love scene at the beginning of the film  br    br   this is a karmen that aims to please to all genders  but a real carmen  she is not  br    br   we would like to see ms  gai in other films in which her talent is better used than here             this is a very noir kind of episode  it begins with jim returning from a weekend trip with a new girlfriend  the recently divorced karen mills  pat delaney  daughter in law of john huston  who knew a few things about noir film  and her daughter  when they arrive  karen goes in the house while jim picks up her daughter from the back seat and carries her up to her room  he then discovers karen has disappeared without a trace  of course he calls dennis and when the police arrive  they see no sign of karen  but find her next door neighbor murdered in the bushes  so of course that makes jim an immediate suspect  br    br   this is a great little mystery and the first half of the story is shown by rocky asking jim to go over the story once again  rocky suggests that by jim telling him the story he might remember a little detail that he didn  t think was important at the time  but now might lead to a clue as to what happened  it  s a really well written scene and completes the transition of the rocky character from a grifter to a concerned parent  it also goes a long way to show that rocky isn  t just some clueless old man either  as he says   you come to me because i  m your father  and i  m smarter than you    this is one of those times where we see where jim got his smarts  br    br   this episode also features an appearance by hottie lara parker  who played angelique in the   dark shadows   series and went on to play laura banner  bruce  s wife in the   incredible hulk   series a few years later  she looks terrific here  br    br   this episode also marks the first mention of the minette crime family  a name that would keep popping up on the rockford files almost whenever they needed a mob family  this time  its vincent minette who rockford helps apprehend  br    br   lt  diehl  tom atkins  makes his first appearance on the series and dennis is quietly demoted from a police lieutenant that he was on the earlier season one episodes to a police sargent  i guess they figured it would be better to have dennis less powerful and add some conflict between jim and the police  frankly  they were right  though i prefer the later lt  chapman to lt  diehl   br    br   not a lot of the typical   rockford   humor in this episode  but a good mystery with a lot of heart             the royal rumble has traditionally been one of my favourite events  and i  ve been a wrestling fan for a good few years now  the other shows may have better matches  but i  ve always found the actual rumble match to be full of excitement  br    br   i  m not going to reveal the winners of any match as i don  t see it as fair to ruin the results on a review  i will comment on the quality of them though  br    br   we have the standard   matches  and then the big rumble event  two from smackdown and two from raw  br    br   shawn michaels and edge open up for raw  this proves to be a good match from two talented guys  this is a match i  d recommend watching  it  s hard to sum up without giving away the winner  br    br   next we have the usual undertaker against some big nasty monster  be whoever it is  giant gonzales  yokozuna  kamala    well this time it  s heidenreich  its also a casket match  typical undertaker fare  watch if you  re a fan  i have to admit i am  purely for the entertainment factor  it can hardly be regarded as a classic wrestling match  br    br   the next two matches are the title matches  for once smackdown manages to upstage raw  their title match is pretty thrilling and enjoyable  but with a anti climax and let down to end it  raw  s match is a pretty dull and boring affair  which is a pity as i  m a fan of both guys involved  br    br   now to the main reason i love the event  the rumble  it  s a pretty good one this year  coming up to the event we all had a pretty good idea of who might win  and it may not prove a big surprise  but hey  its very enjoyable  there are the usual diverse ways of people being eliminated  there is the token guy who doesn  t make it to the ring  the entrant who is ridiculous and we all want to see vanquished  and someone gets eliminated by a previously eliminated combatant  it has its usual highs and lows  and i loved the ending  in particular the vince mcmahon entrance  br    br   i  d recommend this show  not the wwe on top form  but its still good  add it to your collection             i remember this in a similar vein to the young ones  we  d stumble back from the pub and watch this or tape it and then spend weeks replaying the lines to each other  br    br   we called one of our mates   zipmole watkins   after the brilliant episode in which daniel peacock has a bit of   restyling   on his nose by the back street abortionist  br    br   lots of great lines   remember at      in the morning you can only get white bread from a brown man  take it easy guy      gandhi as a local shopkeeper  br    br   tony woodcock was definitely on there in the episode they were teaching ralph  daniel peacock  to be a barman   it  s no good amanda i  ll never make it as a bar man   helen lederer teaches him to ask people about the match   see the match last night  i thought woodcock played well   after a string of failed conversations the curly haired arsenal star was sitting at the bar    see the match last night      yeah  i thought i played well   br    br   we still do odd stupid lines now     reg and ralph      or        ralph and reg  reg  reg    reg reg reg reg   br    br   lots of very surreal silly moments and very surreal songs from the flatlets   the back street abortionist a personal favourite with the great ending line     and he  ll mark your packages   return to sender   br    br   good old danny peacock   you added a lot to some young drinkers   evenings sir  br    br     update   i found a couple of episodes on tape   i  m going to upload the gandhi sketch to youtube               destined to be a classic before it was even conceptualized  this game deserves all the recognition it deserves  at a time when first person shooters like quake iii arena and unreal tournament are garnering all the attention of computer gamers  graphic adventures are a dying breed  with great pun and humour  the curse of monkey island is a game that people of all age groups would enjoy  life can only improve after playing the curse of monkey island   prediction  the sequel escape from monkey island is already destined to be a classic too  i guarantee it             stephane audran is the eponymous heroine of this beautifully measured study of a small danish community towards the end of the last century  two beautiful and musically talented sisters give up their own prospects of happiness and marriage in order to look after their ageing father  one day  a french woman  babette  comes to work for them  after some years she wins the lottery and is determined to do something for the sisters who have taken her in  her solution is to prepare an exquisite and sumptuous feast  which changes the lives of all those invited  this is a film about human and cultural interaction  reflected in the changing language of the dialogue from danish to french  and especially between the dutiful sobriety of protestant northern europe and the sensuousness of the catholic south  it is also about human needs  and how warmth and kindness can be expressed and stimulated through the cultivation of the senses  a profoundly uplifting film             this movie was way over hyped  a lot of the viewers  who thought this was   amazing   must have been into the old school movies  cause the whole movie is set in the past  at first i thought the movie was just showing something from the past  so i was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass  but it just going  basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past  and the   don  t mix very well in this movie  even with special effects  you could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with  there are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did  so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying   it  s the greatest movie ever done    it  s just crap on a stick  it also didn  t help that the story line was sooo crappy  i don  t understand why hollywood agreed to have this movie produced  and i also don  t understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this  it  s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print     it will all be done on a computer    this was a movie that should have been on a movie network  because nothing about this movie was revolutionary  i  m very upset with myself for paying money to see this  whatever you do  don  t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow             it is incredible that there were two films with the same story released in       this one came out a day before that other one with tom cruise  didn  t they do that with truman capote the same year  and the zodiac killer last year  interesting  br    br   writer director david michael latt didn  t have steven spielberg  s budget and c  thomas howell is not tom cruise  this is a pale imitation of the blockbuster that grossed      million worldwide  br    br   the action was minimal and most of the time we were treated to the whining of rhett giles  who played a pastor that was giving up on his god  br    br   gary busey was creepy as an army lt             i dunno sometimes   you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there  but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved    bat people    which i saw under the title   it lives by night    is just such a movie  you can  t watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on   night gallery    and not one of the better ones  either   br    br   the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were bat who drinks human blood   actually  you  d think if he was turning into a real bat  he  d be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket  but because this is a cheap  lurid horror movie  blood  s the word   in spite of the fact that he has grand mal seizures at the drop of a hat  and black out episodes almost every night  his friend and fellow physician  dr  mustache aspen extreme  insists that he  s just having an   allergic reaction   to the rabies shots  meanwhile  the world  s most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls  and one wino   also meanwhile  the doctor  s wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction   br    br   it  s not so much that the acting is bad   you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices  and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script  even the guy who plays the sheriff   okay  it is pretty bad  but it  s bad in a clich  d  wooden  professional way   it  s just that everything about the acting  the way the scenes are paced  the costumes  the dialog  the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to  well  slap everyone involved  br    br   i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky  unsettling little cult favorite  but  br    br     the director needed to beat michael pataki  an experienced character actor  with a chair until pataki agreed to act  and not just channel dennis weaver   br    br     he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole   bat bites human  who then turns into a bat   scenario   br    br      he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his   episodes    instead of resorting to   man has a seizure   page from the little golden book of clich  d acting mannerisms   br    br      he needed to rework the whole   wife   character  make her both more intelligent  less shrill and waaaaay more observant   br    br   i would never voluntarily watch this film again  except with the help of mike and the bots  it  s bad  but it isn  t bad in a silly  humorous or interesting way  still better than   battlefield earth   or   waterworld    though             big fat liar is what you get when you combine terrific writing  great production  and an emphasis on clever ideas over adolescent pap  the two stars work great together  and  what can i say  amanda bynes shines  putting   irkel   and lee majors in the film were brilliant touches  watch this film with your kids  if you don  t laugh throughout it  you must not have been paying attention             tim robbins and john cusack are two actors i have appreciated throughout their careers  and that was the only reason for choosing to watch this movie  well  all i can say is i totally regretted it  these two great actors humiliate themselves all the way through by performing a number of irrelevant  unimaginative and kitch to the extreme  not that this is bad on its own sketches that are supposed to make people laugh  but fail to do so  the only reason i can think is that the director was their friend  and they decided to support his movie by starring in it i can  t think of anything else because this movie is so cheap  fortunately tim robbins and john cusack haven  t disappointed me ever since  i would recommend you to avoid this film  unless you want your opinion about the two actors spoiled             on watching this film  i was amazed at how media perception can mould a persons opinion of a celebrity  karen carpenter was a carefree  but very unconfident young lady  whose wonderful voice helped her and her brother richard to soar the charts with wonderful songs  as with all celebrities of today  they were often criticised about their music as well as their looks  styles  etc  this had a huge effect on karen who raged a battle against her eating and drastically lost weight  which eventually caused her death  this heart felt film was not initially something which i would have thought of watching  but on starting to view it  then i was hooked  in the same way that the tina turner story does  then this film enlightens you and allows you to see into the young performers life  the acting was superb and even after nearly    years after it was made  then the directional and the dialogue are still entertaining  br    br   i would recommend this to anyone who hasn  t yet watched it  it is amazingly accurate and emotionally charged             nothing is sacred  just ask ernie fosselius  these days  everybody has a video camera  and a movie is hardly out before the spoofs start flying  quickly written and shot  and often posted directly to the internet  spoofs are hot these days  and we go out of our way to make sure filmmakers don  t get off on their own self importance     years ago  when the first star wars was made  it was a different world  filmmaking was the playground of a select few and spoofs were very rare  then god gave us hardware wars  it was shot to look cheap  or was it just cheap   and the audio was obviously recorded after the fact  does that take away from the experience  heck no  that  s what makes it so great  it was raw and unpolished  and hit relentlessly on some of the more pretentious moments of the original movie  from fluke starbucker waving around a flashlight instead of a lightsaber  i did that when i was young   to chewchilla the wookie monster  to auggie ben doggie  s   nah  just a little headache   remark  this film short is as much a part of the phenomenon as any of the actual star wars films  rent it  buy it  borrow it from a friend  and may the farce be with you  always             i hated it  i hate self aware pretentious inanity that masquerades as art  this film is either stupidly inane or inanely stupid  after the first half hour  i fastfowarded through the dvd version  and saw the same juvenile shennanigans over and over and over  i became angered that i had spent hard earned money for sophomoric clap trap  tinting drivel in sepia or blue does not make something a movie  let alone art             i usually try to be professional and constructive when i criticize movies  but my god    this was the worst movie i have ever seen  bad acting  bad effects  bad script  bad everything   br    br   the plot follows a group of teen cliche  s on their way to a rave  that takes place in broad daylight  at a remote island  however  when the group arrives  all they find is an empty dance floor and bloody clothes  determined to find out what happened to the rest of the party goers  the clan set  s off on a mission through a zombie infested forest  during this crusade  they are aided by a police chick and a sea captain that just happens to have the right number of weapons to give to each of the kids  they also meet up with jonathan cherry and some other survivors  basically the rest of the movie is a collection of poorly directed action sequences including a far too long shootout outside of the   house of the dead    this fight came complete with cheesy hollywood violence  redundant clips from the hotd video game  and sloppy matrix esque camera rotations  one of the character  s even volunteers to sacrifice himself to save the others  why  not because he was noble and brave  but because part of his face got scarred by acid a zombie spat on him after he continued to beat the creature long after it had been disabled  i  m supposed to feel sorry for this guy    br    br   to sum it all up  there is absolutely no point in seeing this movie unless you want to see for yourself just how terrible it is  the theater i was in was more dead than the zombies on the screen  and i  m sure the money i wasted seeing this piece of sh t could easily cover the costs it took to make it  grade  f            if you like me is going to see this in a film history class or something like that at your school  try to convince your teacher to see something else  believe me  anything is better than this movie  it is slow paced  confusing  boring  poorly constructed  gory  gringy  do i need to go on  it  s message is good  but i have seen them been handled better in several other films  the acting isn  t even any good  this movie is just even more awkward  as it start off as being funny  not intensional though because of it  s surreal story  than at the end  just becomes uncomfortable to watch  br    br   i honestly feel like   hour and    minutes of my life has been robbed  why would anyone want to watch a girls describe a threesome for    minutes  than watch them drive through a traffic jam for    minutes  listen to a hippie who can make sheep appear  witness a sort of rape  than see the female lead role eat her husband  br    br   honestly this movie deserves nothing but a       and if your not happy with my preview seriously i  m an open minded guy and i like movies that protest through symbolism  but this movie was just awful  make any excuse you can  to avoid this film             this is like a zoology textbook  given that its depiction of animals is so accurate  however  here are a few details that appear to have been slightly modified during the transition to film  br    br     handgun bullets never hit giant komodo dragons  it doesn  t matter how many times you shoot at the komodo  bullets just won  t go near it  br    br     the best way to avoid being eaten by a giant cobra  or a giant komodo dragon  is just to stand there  the exception to this rule is if you  ve been told to stay very still  in which case you should run off  until the komodo is right next to you  and then you should stand there  expecting defeat  br    br     minutes of choppy slow motion footage behind the credits really makes for enjoyable watching  br    br            is a memory enhancement tool  and an ample substitute for losing your boating license getting arrested  br    br     members of elite army units don  t see giant komodo dragons coming until they are within one metre of the over sized beings  maybe the computer generated nature of these dragons has something to do with it  br    br     when filming a news story aiming on exposing illegal animal testing  a reporter and a cameraman with one camera is all the gear and personnel you will need  sound gear  a second camera  microphones etc are all superfluous  br    br     when you hear a loud animal scream  and one person has a gun  he should take it out and point it at the nearest person  br    br     when you take a gun out  the sound of the safety being taken off will be made  even if your finger is nowhere near the safety br    br     reporters agree to go half way around the world in order to expose something   without having the faintest idea what they  re exposing  background research and vague knowledge are out of fashion in modern journalism  br    br     handguns hold at least    bullets in one clip  and then more than that in the next clip  despite that  those with guns claim that they will need more ammo  br    br     expensive cameras  also  remember that the reporter only has one camera  are regularly left behind without even a moment  s hesitation or regret  these cameras amazingly manage to make their way back to the reporter all by themselves  br    br     the blonde girl really is the stupid one  br    br     the same girl that says not to go into a house because a komodo dragon can easily run right through it  thus making it unsafe  takes a team into a building made of the same material for protection   and nobody says a word about it  br    br     high tech facilities look like simple offices with high school chemistry sets  br    br     genetically modified snakes grow from normal size to     feet long in a matter of a day  but don  t grow at all in the weeks either side  br    br     the military routinely destroys entire islands when people don  t meet contact deadlines  br    br     men with guns don  t necessarily change the direction they  re shooting when their target is no longer right in front of them  instead  they just keep shooting into the air  br    br     the better looking you are  the greater your chance of surviving giant creatures  br    br     women  s intuition is reliable enough to change even the most stubborn of minds  br    br     any time you  re being hunted by giant creatures is a great time to hit on girls half your age  br    br     animal noises are an appropriate masking noise for   swearing   at the same volume  br    br     old israeli and russian planes are regularly used by the us military']"
